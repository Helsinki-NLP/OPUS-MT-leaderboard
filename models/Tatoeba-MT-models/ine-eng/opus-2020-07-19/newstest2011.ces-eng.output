What's he doing? ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or sugar
A new city council from ČSSD will have to overcome a certain language barrier, according to everything, so that they can understand their senior ODS colleagues in the Prague Council and representation.
Diník Aktuálno.cz members of the new council of the ČSSD "explored", as they know notorically introduced slang, which occurred on the council during the last years when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which was introduced by the Prague political junkie during the previous era by Prime Minister Paul Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations, and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new council members did not understand much.
At least they say so.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm in Prague politics more than a novel," responded to a "kmotrovski" dictionary's test for the culture of Lukas Kauský.
And as far as the political veteran was concerned, so did Councilman Charles Brézin.
It's like a golf jacket.
"It's the only expression you're presenting to me that I sometimes use."
"I don't generally know the snake."
From the dictionary, whose phrases the journal Aktualno.cz published this year in June before the ODS election congress, she chose the editors of six examples, mostly those that are notorically associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf course in Prague", "to go to the sugarcane", "the bull's shirt", "the betrayal of the capital" and "to teach".
Three of the councillors agreed, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is going to be head of Prague School in the future - promised first the interview, but did not take the phone later.
The fifth councillor Petr Dolinek rejected the flat test.
"I don't even solve these things, and I won't evaluate how much the citizens of the Democratic Republic enjoy."
"I am now deciding how we will understand within our programmes," he responded.
As already reported, the councillor Lukas Kaucký would not have found out in the title that it is about the influential businessman and friend of the expropriator Bem Roman Janouskova.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to him, and the only term that was right in the test is "the biggest golf jacket in Prague".
"It's Blanka's tunnel," says Kaucky, and he adds immediately, "But I know it from the news."
"I'm gonna have to pay for some language courses," she says.
The Gulf Cave, then, as a Blanka tunnel, deciphers not only the Matador Karel Březina, but also works for the environment of Lukas Plachý.
Both social democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lucas Plachem is also aware of where to find this character - the true meaning of the expression "to go to the sugar shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague business," is a flat-out close to the fact that it's the Janousk firm's seat.
In agreement with Brezina, it is recalled that knowledge has more to do with news than to use such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the frequency of the test, there is no similar dictionary of slang expressions.
"I've had fun with my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We call ourselves more names, sometimes short names are used, and the coal mines are named," says the President of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulinský, whose customers are nicknamed Hulda.
"In school they called me Bríza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," she admits to her own nickname, Karel Brēzin.
Dinik Currently, the name has been tested and worked.
The Weinert Council is for the parties Grandpa or less friendly Grandpa, deputy Miroslav Poche, who has warned of fraud in the party's sponsorship before the elections, has some of his colleagues' nickname "Game".
The nicknames are also the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in the domestic talk.
Hullinski prei Hulda does not like to hear, but the daily Aktuálno.cz also noted another nickname of this Prague president.
"Doctor of Coach Law" reminds us that Petr Hullinský won his title JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "magics", issued a brochure
Women declared in Burkina Faso as witches have several common characters.
They belong to an older generation, they cannot engage in work for example for health reasons, they are free and they have no children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent to isolation to keep the rest of the village safe.
"The man of this fate is only very rare."
"No young healthy women are dismissed because they help in work and have children," describes a regular sister who is taking care of more than a hundred women in a special home in the capital city of West Africa in Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to move against the unusual "social measure".
She published an information brochure that should help her to limit the magic spell.
He's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," said Die Standard newspaper.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which neighbored Burkina Faso, Amy Hemmah died two and a half decades ago last week after three women and two men tortured her, oiled her and burned her.
He informed the BBC server about the case.
The Pachatels claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence of circumstances.
According to their version, the woman had oil used for ritual anointing.
He fell asleep just after the group wanted to "get out of the evil spirit."
The isolation of "magics" supports people regardless of the level of education achieved.
Dinik Der Standard quoted a twenty-four-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "Fooders of human souls have always been dangerous," he said.
While in Burkina Faso he is trying to calm the government, in Gambia he was still the president himself in last year.
"The Gambian President Jammi, after his aunt's death, spread a great hoon to a witch who allegedly had to share in her death and try to kill the president himself by means of black magic."
"He called upon the shamans from nearby Guinea, who, along with the police, soldiers and the president's personal protections, violently expelled randomly selected men and women from the Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanila," said Amnesty International in his report.
On the farm, people had to drink herbal medicine with hallucinogenic effects that also caused stomach and kidney problems.
Two prisoners didn't survive on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were finally released for freedom.
Bacal's tenant: Burn in stones, higher rent signed
The senior subordinate man walked out of the door of the client centre of RPG Apartments "hlobarona" Zdeňka Bakaly, the largest private owner of apartments in Czech Republic.
Under guard he carried a file and in it a new lease to three apartments: his daughter and his son, who is in execution of the sentence.
All three of them just took the rent.
Instead of 3500 a month, the son will pay for 2+1 second category 4100 crowns from next year.
"And there's no hot water and it has to be warmed by the petrama (stone on a thin fuel, known as red)," shows a man's finger in the new contract of his son, whose signature has full power.
"But I signed it," explains half angry and half disfigured.
The Civil Society BytyOKD.cz, which has designated new terms as "incorrect and unequal", advises tenants not to sign a new contract and wait until 7 December, when the public guidance on how to deal with it.
But the man has a hand over it.
"One says it, the other says it," he goes dark.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory of deregulation.
After New Year's Eve, a large majority of apartments in the Czech Republic are not available for rent.
Currently, therefore, it was decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The Havířůvsk skárán RPG is one of four in Ostravska and is already full on Tuesday 9 a.m.
The security agency and the initiating device shall be immediately at the side of the door.
"Rent 2011", lights a special button on his touch screen.
One punch and a piece of paper with a number out of the machine.
You don't even get to read "157" and your number is already leaking on a large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
In half a second, you're in line.
After a while, an older couple comes to ask for their rent, but new rentals are obviously not concerned at all.
Most people have come to solve common problems such as other - requests for repair, insurance and so on.
Letters with new rental contracts are available in Ostrava to mail boxes for most tenants with a total of 44,000 RPG portfolios almost from mid-November.
RPG Estates in letters suggest an increase of between 15 and 38 per cent.
A special transfer to new rentals was opened at the customer centre on 18 November.
"It runs over the week, so it's just in the race," the workers respond to the shift after a moment of movement when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregation and Bakal's former mountain apartments are local exciting themes.
Before the elections, he was quite enchanted by the Vice-President of Parliament and the island parent Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, and even now he is filled with local newspapers.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"No post... or a toilet board changed me," said the man mentioned at the outset.
For the most part, according to employees, they come to see if they can get a discount from the rent if they sign on time how RPG promises them in a special offer.
Half a discount for February's rent will also be received by other tenants who will sign the new contract by December 15.
Havier's "deregulation" surplus, but questions are definitely not paid.
"Out of the 360 customers here yesterday for the 2011 rent, only about forty to fifty people were there," the workers guessed.
At the same time, on the web and its walls, RPG proposes an individual meeting of contracts where it will be necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree to the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only possible and entirely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG points out on its pages.
"No one will be tried here," one of RPG Byty's employees thinks, and a man on the street in front of the client centre gives her part of the truth.
"I have 13 grand of income and I have five thousand left for food, I don't have to judge," he says.
But the workers will only get away with it.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them in the media not to sign, so people probably wait," he says.
The rental regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to the RPG Byty, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing rental is still not enough for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the resident portfolio of RPG Byty, that the very anger of the tenant's neglect of the housing fund is, according to homeowners, the main reason for the increase in rentals.
While for five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could invest in apartments four billion, for four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the semi-trailered seat of the haviřový waiter so far repeats several redly highlighted information.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31 200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the largest of 7.50 CZK per meter quarter and month," appears on the screen.
Only 400 flats from the RPG portfolio will be rented by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about an increase of an extremely low amount of 19,66 CZK per square metre," RPG points out.
In 2,600 apartments, the same rent will remain next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not exceed the rent by jump, but will be spread to four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) gives the company back to the apartments, mainly to heat savings - new windows and heating.
They're supposed to be getting people to sign a rental agreement.
The office also includes a school, they understand the architects
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new residence of Arch.Design.
No one would expect him to also hide a minivan with everything that belongs to it - with colorful walls, ideal furniture, to buy toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees have been able to visit her.
Arch.Design, from which the studios took up a number of major mining buildings, has been counting with space for its company mini-ministry since the first drawings of the building of Avriopoint.
It employs almost 90 people mostly at the age of babyboom, and it was her concern that women designers and architects could return to work quickly.
With the possibility of short-term benefits, Arch.Design offers its employees a social program.
Buildings and architects thus have the opportunity to lock up a demanding job with child care.
The mini-school was developed by Arch employees themselves.The design and the support of management have been able to obtain the support of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company ministration is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the PRC.
Thanks to the grant funding (CZK 2,8 million grants), they could purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operations for a period of two years.
After spending the financial contribution (2 years) Arch.Design has an obligation to operate a mini-school for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of the project lasted for one year and with the application for a grant, the company significantly helped Economic Rating.
Peči provides a qualified staff, a nurse and an MSH teacher care for the children all day, so children can go to school without age limits, although most of them are older than 3 years old.
Because it's about a mini-school, there can be only 5 children at the moment, but more kids get out of the way during the day.
School management is flexible according to the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of the company's hierarchy.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-school is comparable to the framework pre-school education programme.
Children are not only playing here, but they are also provided with quality education - from basic knowledge to preparation for school courses, English is also being taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, exciting games, but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and drop out of stress with the late child’s education from schools away from their parents ’ workplace.
Parents use their working time more productively.
It is no wonder that there is a naturally loyal relationship between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design thus classified itself as Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, are friendly to the family and through this program strengthened personal marketing.
The house from the bone also fascinates after 100 years. Look into the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of the ancient jacuzzi, the backyard reminds of five dinosaurs and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the locals, thanks to its organic forms, he served the name of the House from the bone.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, pieces of tiles and mosaics, a facade that resembles hollows and all-powerful soft curves, all of which is typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The walls of the house play dream lines, soft colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
In detail, it is possible to see geometry, rhythm, and the exact order of thought.
The whole facade of the house sounds even more dramatic at night, it is lit so that the touch of light colors is even strengthened.
The guilt and cracking of the shapes is shown in the same measure in the interiors.
The wood in the waves is copied by a thin frame, a lattice, a pleasant element of the door, a hook and leaves.
The house of Batlló, located in the Eixample district on the Russian shopping street Passeig de Gràcia nr. 43, was created by architect Emilio Sala Cortese in 1877.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon he accepted Gaudí’s idea of unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The kitchen house of Casa Batlló, but Antoni Gaudí didn't propose it on his own.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol cooperated with him.
Just on his designer skirt, decorations were created for representative apartment owners of the property and the use of mosaics on the facade.
A number of other artists and artists were working on the facade.
The joint work on the projects at Casa Batlló's house was starting to work successfully with Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the building of Gaudi's house Casa Mila and Park Güell, where there are other Gaudi's works.
From the local house of beauty after completion, he earned the nickname "House of Bones" thanks to his organic forms.
Others called him "a living house" because of a specific window opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building there is a sword of St. Jir, patron of Catalan.
Hidden religious motives also include other so - called building elements.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system with industrial channels and typical fireplaces for his time.
The Bizarní can appear their forty-five degrees.
At the time of Gaudí’s creation, he absolutely did not respect the building rules and did not allow them to be bound.
At the beginning of the building, however, the construction permits were obtained from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so important that two years later when the city council was completed, the city council was born and asked for repair.
For example, the Council instructed the construction of pillars to enter the public hall.
It never happened, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the city part was called for (and successfully obtained) permission to rent two of the highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social living room and on the third floor of the bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented a shrine.
The whole six-storey house is an open terrace that can be reached on the very roof terrace.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí was also working with a modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors and the larger company can communicate comfortably together without at the same time maintaining the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facades, the house with Gaudí’s reconstruction also received a non-traditional collapse and two more.
Gaudi's game is also effective with light, blue and white coloured lawns, which are covered in the inner courtyard, and lamps.
The game of two colors adds the maximum light in all patterns of the house.
It was easy to put on the principle that the white reflects the light more than the dark, which the sun’s paprika, on the contrary, swallows.
The House of Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most hideous apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to this step until 2002, at the occasion of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
The survey was stopped because they found it to be a very useful business and, in addition, extended the survey to common and underground spaces, including roof terraces.
The memory is definitely not negligible, making 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and tour operators have a 20% discount.
The amount exceeds significantly the price of entry into other Gaudí's buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the right atmosphere of the house with dragon wigs, you need to quickly come along with one of the people in the kitchen and visit it directly at home.
How to Choose Maternity and Growth: Women Have Requirements other than Men
Never a generous bed frame, but the quality of the bed area, which means the mattresses and the growth, provide a really good bed base.
However, they must be harmoniously complemented to suit the specific user.
In the selection, he decides many things, from weight, height, age, health status and sex of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior to which the mattresses and growth are arranged.
A typical example?
Maybe the weekend chalupas, where they don't melt regularly, are not suitable latex mattresses, because they're slowing down.
In addition, they have significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is then necessary to turn regularly.
If they don't have a lot of air channels in the core, and they're still on a solid desktop, they're holding moisture: there might be some dust under them.
He also decides on his choice.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, often using very high mattresses with a softening layer, will find it difficult to feel good on a low and hard surface.
"I hope all the hockeyers who came back from the NHL complained they wouldn't sleep here."
"On their determined shoulders, legs and sides, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of linen foam."
"These are recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system, so they misconcept the "information" from the hips and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamskikov, who specializes in the refined furniture.
A lot of hockey players, but also other customers, so years ago, the mattress with a line of foam was searched.
"Today it's okay, the right mattress has Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL fighter to assess the lead.
This miracle works easily.
Optimizes your stomach and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
You're not going to get any pressure at night. You're not going to turn around like you're having a hard fight.
Just get better sleep.
The line of foam also works as a protection against protrusions.
When choosing the size of the mattress to your height, add a length of feet, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women with a height of 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm in double size, i.e. 180 cm in total.
For single beds, such as single beds, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For a comfortable and possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back you should have your hands gently bent in the lap," advises Helena Prokopová, a specialist of Cechu chaplains and decorators, who has been devoted to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of the accommodation for a number of years and is taught at specialist schools.
For doubles, you need every own growth and mattress, but here's a shopping watch to sweeten the mattress heights.
Otherwise, it will be nothing but mounting growth to different heights, but you do not have to work at every frame of bed.
Pendant mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with at least 15, of which at least three centimeters are calculated on the forming and bridging layer.
"If you touch your hand or touch the mattress, you certainly don't have the guts to feel," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grill.
The whole bed, when the mattresses and the floor are like the grown Siamese twins, don't have anything to do in the rooms.
The mattresses are badly windy, they can't clean up their tracks, which is already normal today.
And since we usually spend 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat at night, it's clear that after five to seven years of mattressing, it starts to remember one large (and encapsulated) network.
That's why experts refuse advertising slogans about the life of the mattresses up to 25 years, or even life assurances.
But everything has its own.
Therefore, the advice from the practice of the sellers: do not give up a tapestack with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work, but rather add a mattress protector that can easily be removed and washed.
Although mattresses are usually produced today throughout the circuit, so after dilution, we get two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine very important!), however, manipulation in larger types (and in one person) could be a reminder of the struggle of light weight in the ring with difficulty.
Do you have a solid board in your bed instead of a barbecue?
Never!
Maximum on the bed for one night's visits.
However, measure the board (if no longer available) with wind holes and use a mattress with a spring edge and a height of at least 15 cm with spring in bags (with it.Taschenfederkern) and a cypress layer.
There's no polyurethane mattress on such a basis.
On non-alloy blades, 14 to 18 blades will be suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (needs a combination of latex and coconuts), but you will always be paid for vegetables with a larger number of blades, 28 and more, where the blades are in the area of ber divided and it is possible to regulate their home.
There are no matrices with a cobra, because they do not respond to the cosmos.
Alongside the setting of the house, you can also enjoy the so-called shoulder colébque.
It's a special capture of the blades that allow you to push or even bend the blade so that the shoulder of the burner "forgets".
For men who have "a shoulder across the back," certainly important thing.
It is even remembered by the matrices producers who in the "panish" began to use the softening zone just in the area of the frame.
Women are also remembered - they are once again offering soft surface in the hives.
For the most demanding customers, crystal or tart growers with so-called multitorcal periphery are designed.
Pressure splits into more points and reduces tension.
However, as soon as you use the correct mattress and grow the wrong pillow (large and "enriched") most of the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow is designed to support the head and the tip only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can be released.
A suitable size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should equal the height of the shoulder (with the shoulder belt or with a bent zone in the mattress).
Modern mattresses have nothing to do with original strawberries filled with grass.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least a mixture.
The trend was just at the prom.
Oils from which polyurethane foams are produced are replaced by natural oils, such as poppy and soybean.
They're just using soybean. They're all known manufacturers.
"Many of the mattresses mean that the core is made of pure natural material," explains Petr Vasiček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattresses, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also welcome micro-capsules to relax your fresh scent of wood or lavender.
There's a division for men and women.
While a man "sweeps" a plant extract from the bristle to absorb the matre's heat and cool the body, women instead of the "top".
The red pepper extract increases blood circulation, so the lower sex is warmer.
Today's favorites?
The mattress made of cold foam (has larger pores with damaged cell structure, is so much more flexible than normal polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
A combination of various homes of cold feathers and "lying" feathers emerges multi-zonal mattresses, which know exactly where to be head, thighs and pads.
You'll pay for quality mattresses from seven thousand crowns and higher.
Those who fulfil the health parameters have a lower rate of VAT, are taken as health aid.
As the first in the Czech Republic to achieve this advantage Gumotex.
Saving on mattress and barbecue is not easy.
Sometimes action by producers or sellers who offer two mattresses at one price can be used.
The Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with all memory foams of memory for 11,990 crowns.
The other one can be arranged free of charge.
The Eru line or viscoeltic foam with an open cell structure and high density started with the "cosmic" tempur material.
Originally created as a material for NASA, because at the beginning the astronauts were exposed to an enormous burden.
The temperature in the heat softens, the cold gets stronger.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and releases its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the creation of proletarians, but also to increase the comfort of sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special pillows under the feet that relax the legs and the vital system.
For example, the domestic producers use the pen Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and so on.
People's tracking devices want as many parents as possible, so they want to protect their children
Fear of your own child leads more and more people to the idea of watching over the GPS.
The system originally created for car tracking can also monitor the movement of people, thus helping in cases such as the disappearance of the nine - year - old Anička Janatkova.
The device is about as big as a box of cheese, but soon it can only be large as clocks.
A number of people scared the missing Anička case and began asking for ways to protect their children better.
Even at the price of their privacy breach.
"We're trying to tell everyone that it's not about any spying, but about another means of reducing the likelihood that some tragedy will happen," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I'm assuming that in a certain case, it may happen that such devices are being abused, i.e. by someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't met with such a case yet."
"Most of the customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how to use it in case of need.
The child psychologist Dana Bočkova points out that if a child does not want to wear anything like that, he simply gets rid of it.
"And very young children show great creativity in how some things are allowed to lose if they don't want to be controlled."
"A lot of expectations have been raised earlier with mobile parents who, however, are allowed to turn off the same as these monitoring devices," Bočová claims.
It also argues that in the event of an attack such a device would really help.
"When it comes to a planned kidnapping, the offender will practically always ensure that the child has no electronics that could make up his position."
"Now it's the phone."
"When they begin to expand the tracking equipment, they will also search for them, because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In such a case, criminals will always take a step forward in front of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it may be accepted that a similar device can help in the event of undetected pedophilia attack.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and persons, and in the event of an attack on the immediate destruction of the tracking device, its presence may be helpful.
"The device may be set to the regular dispatch of the position after a certain period of time."
"If his damage occurs, at least the last location of the person concerned will be available."
"Dearer devices have built-in and accliometers, so even if a person just slammed and remained motionless, they send an instant warning device with the appearance of the position," says the Czech.
According to him, a similar service can also take smart mobile phones with navigation, where it is enough to record special software.
The problem of the current monitoring units is that it is either a device similar to a box size trailer or a smaller mobile phone.
It's always so threatening to lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, therefore, a device that looks like a normal digital clock is now being tested.
"It will have the greatest advantage that a possible aggressor does not have to know the tracking device at all."
"Or she's known after a while and she can give the police more time," she adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in straps or trailers, they will continue to use the same technology used to monitor vehicles.
It is a combination of GPS position detection (using normal autonavigation) and mobile phone function, which reports the current position of the vehicle.
The army has a fire-fighting line to wrap up the Czech Republic. But it will last only two years.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers [445 km] of rails that fire the markets.
Last year, however, the Ministry of Defence added 224 miles [224 km] to the funds.
The army has 225-year-old resources.
The problem is that the sustainability of the rope is two, up to four years.
The army has bought fire-fighting chains from the STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The general staff for reasons of buying so large a quantity of MF DNEs incinerators said that soldiers in training consume 60 kilometres of incinerators annually.
However, it follows from the reports of military pyrotechnics, which MF DNES spoke of, that then, with a very intensive pyrotechnic training, all generals, officers of the army, secretaries or cleaning staff would have to go through each year.
Minister of Defence Alexandra Vondr and Army Commander Vlastil Picka is not exempt.
That's the only reason why the army's annual consumption would be 60 miles [60 km] away.
This length corresponds to 25 thousand explosions.
And even if it did, the army's resources would last for more than ten years.
On the contrary, if the basic training of each new professional is only about two meters of fire-fighting wires, as experts say, the army has provided for the purchase of fresh goods - including the increased consumption of female or special units - supplies for the above 225 years.
The troops of the rapid deployment brigade, while Minister Vondrova, have recently personally complained that they do not have nearly any weapons at hand, so the shootings are also limited due to the need for money.
Don't talk about lack of underwear.
"This doesn't take my head off that they buy from us all the time so much incinerators."
"But it's their decision and they know what they're going to do."
"For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we as traders are trying to make a statement," says the business manager STV Group Jan Děcký.
The spokesperson of Jan Pejšek defends hundreds of kilometres of purchased cords and that the army will have the resources of this "municipal" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký from the STV Group, however, speaks only of the four-year life of a firearm and police or military pyrotechnics for only two years.
"With the perfect storage it can be the four," says one of them, who as a soldier does not want to publish the name because of the criticism of the army.
After life has passed, each ammunition must carefully test whether it is still reliable and does not threaten the soldiers for life.
These tests, however, are not free and are worth more money.
Another argument by the Ministry is a multi-stakeoff of 445 kilometers of fire-sweet rails.
"We stood at 60 per cent less than the last delivery of two hundred and forty kilometers," explains Pejšek spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence Procurement.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of fire-fighting lines of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate ammunition from World War II or here after the Soviet army, does not exceed a few years of 1,500 meters.
And the police are always ordering just a lot to consume this ammo before life's down.
It has been certified for the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence already faces significant difficulties with the elimination of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two-setched Czechoslovakian army was preparing to move to Rýn.
According to the pyrotechnics mentioned by MF DNES, there is a problem in a few years' time: it will eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old fires that today "lasino" buys.
So far, I've been pumping out of the contacts that I've got through the competition.
The winner of the competition The Year's Health Caregiver helped Lukas Pytloun sell his hotel French.
The winner of the last year's competition The Year's Lifeline became the 18th-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun from Liberce.
His story of success is like a movie.
Lucas Pytlon loved traveling.
And he realized abroad that there is a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
He bought a five-bedroom semi-detached house from foreign brigades and using a bank loan.
Because he was still a third-year-old high school student at the time, that was a great encouragement.
"The present relationship between quality and the price of accommodation with us did not allow me to try to do anything about it," says Lukas Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment started to hire foreign workers.
All profits were invested back into the house, which gradually converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with total capacity over 300 beds throughout all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was today's four star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, another, equally high quality came to him.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrovo u Tís, where we sold our French concept and other customers about Pytloun hotels are reporting," said last year's vigour number one.
"And for this sale the license to operate the hotel was very much shared just victory in the Year's Health Competition," Pytloun admits.
Victory has brought him greater knowledge and popularity in Liberia and the surrounding area.
"People knew me on the streets, often even gratified me more, and I have to say that it was nice," he recalls.
Participation in the competition certainly recommends all who are trying to do something.
It's not even necessary to win. Every sight is good.
He says he's been sucking out of contacts and acquaintances to this day, which he might not get.
"With some that I met because of the competition, I started trading regularly."
The glory associated with success, according to him, has reached a little of every employee.
And he's got about seventy of them.
"I see greater loyalty and pride in them to share something that has gained universal recognition."
"It's not far from my personal success, it's the result of good work for all of us together."
"Only my name is dashed to the front," says humbly Luke Pytlon today.
I wish my successor a year calmer than we had at the Farm.
The euphoria of victory quickly eradicated the effects of the crisis.
But thanks to the determination of the winner, Farm has worse times behind him.
For the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Company competition, the owner of Farmet, Karel Ždárský, came to Slovenia last February.
At that time, the jury assessed the efforts it had made to build from a small tool shop in the Czech Skalica firm with stamilion facilities.
"I can say that the appreciation has not only encouraged me, but all my colleagues and has raised our self-confidence for the competition struggle," the last winner says today.
At the beginning of Farm's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered to hire Karl Žjárské's father a small worker as a compensation for communists' entertainment property, he refused a career in the company where he was working at the time, and with a couple of friends around his dads put the company on plastic baths.
Soon thereafter, they began specializing in the leaves of the plant oil.
After eighteen years, they became the largest producers of automatic forests in Central Europe.
More awareness was also gained by the company after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start taking the Farm brand significantly better, but foreign partners also began to appreciate that they were cooperating with the company that achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Gjárský.
Last year, however, he wasn't only in Farmet in the symbol of the euphoria of victory.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic performance until 2008 and only partially since 2009.
And in 2009, it was the most difficult year for the sale of machinery.
A crisis that has not yet affected citizens, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and have begun to limit the purchase of new machinery and technology.
"Of course, this situation didn't escape us."
"The markets dropped by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there was also a release," explains Karel Jjárský.
A life-saving company must sometimes take such non-popular measures.
But things got better, and they kept the company in line, even if I was less than before the crisis.
However, what they have not seen in Farmet is investment in research and development.
"We built research and training centres from the grants, strengthened presentations at international fairs, won major awards at home exhibitions," says Jjedarský.
Everything says the crisis is behind them.
Markets are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Jjárský.
A survey that removes foolish rules
The Absurdita survey of the year is a quarter of the corporate curse.
Some unwise rules have already succeeded.
An unprovoked winner of the next year's Absurdita survey has become an obligation to bring documents to the office, which are also available to officials online.
It decided more than a third of the four thousand votes cast.
For example, management of social security required a paper release from the trade register, even though the official can get it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the survey, it's gonna change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require the release from the trade register in checks on the insurer's payers," ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buranová said.
To focus on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and those foolish to abolish are the subject of the Absurdit competition of the year.
This is already the fourth part of the corporate curse organised by the Economic Journals, and among the public there is a growing interest in the formation.
If the polls were attended by about three thousand voters, four thousand were silent this year.
And there's no wonder, there's enough and enough of the various legal responsibilities that just serve to keep the business.
"It is possible that we are in the world's leading places of tax in the number of posters," notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurships of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has been declared the goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving in any way.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions of business, the Czech Republic has placed itself in 74th position, which is about eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdita competition was first announced in 2006 and takes place annually according to the same scenario.
Administrative and bureaucratic nonsense may be reported by anyone each year from April to the end of September when the competition is concluded.
The website is available at www.firmaroku.cz Then the winner of the competition selects seven candidates for "anticin" and lets the public vote on the website at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz during October.
An absurdity that gets the most votes winning.
More than a hundred, more than 105 regulations and anti-subsidy regulations were reported in the survey this year.
The guys sent businessmen, but also professional ties and journalists.
Among the "finalists" competition is such a requirement, for example, that vehicles for road maintenance and fast-tracking pay a bribe, or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of seven proposals this year is published on the competition page.
The declaration of competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November at the Václav Square in Prague, is part of the Happyning, which regularly participates in political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Economics of the Czech Republic, assisted this competition.
"The economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws business rags under its feet, so it is my goal to cancel at least three dozen paragraphs each year, which today only exacerbates the business," said the Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The attempt to break the foolish regulation does not express itself empty.
In 2007, people were the most affected by the obligation of an entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the health office at the place where the permanent operator is located, the intention being to go with the exhibition station or tower.
This obligation was removed by a new life law.
The second most voted duty in 2007, which was declared by the Office for its foreign staff for up to 30 days, was removed by the Green Card Act.
And to a third of everything good.
An absurd regulation for physiotherapists in 2009 has become a major mirror, refrigerator and two inflatable weights in the office.
This was reduced by the health ministry's statement this year - the obligation to have a refrigerator has fallen.
The new category evaluates responsible companies
Assessment of ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
This year’s fifth year of competition for economic news is a category called the Responsible Company 2010.
The mission of this competition is to support a reasonable and fair business.
"This is how we want to support companies that take into account the environmental impacts of their business and support responsible social activities," says Patrick Bartholda, a regional mobile operator manager, Vodafone, who is the promoter and guarantor of the competition as well as in the case of a year's rebellion competition.
This special sub-category of the Vodafone Company’s main competition this year was registered by companies for which there is no success in undertaking the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be published in a separate article.
Although one of the two activities differs from the other in diameter, their efforts can be regarded as support and consideration for the common denominator.
In one case, for example, people with disabilities and other needs of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists in the whole of the Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a series of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the responsible company in the Pardubische region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of the NPF sponsoring disabled children for 17 years.
On his health-care workers, the old paper from Podébrad, which has more than 70 per cent of them, has therefore received the title of the Central Bank's Responsible Company and in the Vodafone Company competition this year has been placed in the country as a third.
At Olomouck, MiRyz Soft, an accountant, who set up a flexible working time, also reduced to average 35 hours a week, but without a moderately reduced salary.
The Court also awarded the Court its title for primarily purchasing from the Czech producers, supporting civil activities in the near environment and the conservation of the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our businesses and our administrations have as little impact on the environment as possible," explains Dr. Milosz Ryznar.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from Ústecký Čeže re-thinks the health of its employees and has arranged ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each of their notebooks, supporting their work from home and using catering services provided locally protected by work in their corporate activities.
"In addition, we support the hope of a man in the pressure that helps specifically the local Roma community," said a representative of Ondřej Suchý.
In the latter order, it is also mentioned the activities of the Clean and Cleanup company in the Karlovar region, which contributes to their pension insurance to their employees in the form of over-standard bonuses.
"We also contribute to food, transport, qualification and recreation," says Josef Strapác of the Bruntal Building Company Czasch, winner in Moravskoslez region.
The responsible company of the year was automatically registered by all the country finalists of the Vodafone Company of the year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it by 15 August at the latest.
The incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the order.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the competition The responsible company for the year, but are not disqualified from the "main" competition of the Vodafone Company for the year."
"It is not only possible to apply to this competition because it is a subcategory of the company's main competition for the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose Ordering Agency.
Police arrested in public competition at the Land Fund in Plzni
In the building of the Land Fund in Plšna, anti-corruption police were arrested last day.
The detective's iron laid down the local business in the media and the businessmen with the realities of Luboši G.
He allegedly attempted to manipulate the current public competition to settle the refund claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition would be given a specific interest.
That's what Luboshi G. was supposed to pay half a million crowns for.
"I would only like to confirm that the police are bringing one person to the scene in public procurement and in public competition," said Plenary State Deputy Director Antonie Zelena, saying that further details cannot be provided with regard to the ongoing investigation.
Forty-four-year-old policemen were released after 24 hours.
The way in which public competition could have been affected can only be speculated in the light of the minimum official information.
The spokesperson of the Land Fund Lubomíra Montenegro stated on the question of the Law that at a separate workplace in Plšna the police were actually arrested, which was during the public competition.
"It was a client, not our employee," she explained.
The public competition is entitled "The challenge to tender for the transfer of land under the Land Act" according to the Black Correct Name and is made where more eligible applicants are interested in the land offered.
"These persons in the context of the challenge offer a higher value of their refund claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the orders offered, the order of the buyers will be determined and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the speaker explained to the fund.
Orboš G. apparently had information about the applicant, and because he is also a legitimate person, because he has collected a number of refund orders, he offered the interested party the ground that the competition is not involved.
I mean, he's been incarcerating the distance for that.
That would explain that he had so much money to keep.
Luboš G. has had over-standard PF contacts in the Gulf in the past.
He was a figure in the case of former Chief PF Václav Sankot, who was criminally charged with issuing in the replacement refund of the land on which a decision had already been made concerning the location of the building had been made.
At that time, Luboš G. obtained from the fund, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the entrance magistrates were to be built into the Borská field industrial zone.
Later, he changed it very beneficially with the magistrate behind the house in the very historical center of the city, which had much higher value.
At the same time, the council had to come to this because otherwise the building would be compromised by blocking the land.
Households for housing will pay hundreds per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and livestock, hot supplies and somewhere to grow and rent.
The families will have to pull from the ice from the wallet to hundreds of crowns a month more than now.
The electricity saves up to 4.6 percent, the gas will be about 2 percent higher, while in some cities you will have to pay for water supplies and many will also observe central heat supplies.
The damage of the electricity should be carried out annually by house in the apartments on the stock line than it is now.
At the same time, the prices of electricity have decreased by all major suppliers, so there is a significant increase in energy production support from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaic sources.
It's a bit of a waste, though, at a time when people lose most and have the highest consumption.
So it also has to be calculated annually with hundreds of crowns in addition.
While electricity and gas are stored throughout the Republic, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
The price increases are planned mainly by larger municipalities.
For example, a house in Pardubice or Hradci Krālová will pay from January for the central heating of about 50 crowns per month, more than 1000 crowns per year will pay the family in Liberca.
The people of Prague are again threatened to retain more than 9 per cent of the water and livestock, in case the city increases the rent from the infrastructure.
If the rental does not change, the Prazene will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will continue to be lower in the whole of the Republic.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are now among the highest, it has to look up 7.4 percent water and livestock.
For example, they can increase the rental price in 450 thousand rental apartments, where the regulation ends from January.
For example, CPI Housing, which in Ústí nad Laba owns about 2,500 apartments, intends to increase from January to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new higher rent will be willing to give a company to the court.
Regular rentals paid by people in about 300 thousand apartments could increase by 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptional and better brand of whiskey stolen by parents.
These are beverages, after which the most frequent drink is in the care of doctors, who haven't even been 15 years.
An exception are not children who are treated with monkeys in the hospital repeatedly.
This results from the experience of physicians who encounter similar cases at the income of the child wards of hospitals.
"Natural beer or wine are completely worthless, because it takes a long time to get drunk."
"The trend is certainly hard alcohol," said the Prime Minister of the Children's Department of Nemocnice Horovice in the Central Czech Republic, Luděk Pelikán.
"If they can pull a bottle of daddy out of the closet, it's about whiskey, but it's about fernet and vodka."
"The water has the advantage of getting into the juice and it's not that much of it then," the Prime Minister explained.
And the truth is, he's also giving him the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurin.
"It's the most common thing. It's fernet or rum."
"It's modern alcohol today, especially at elementary schools."
"In some cases it was about the sink they brought from home," Jurin said.
According to the primary Pelikana, 13 or 14 years of drinking at hospital reception are relatively common.
He worked for ten years in a pediatrician in Motola, where the nurses bonded their trained schoolchildren from a wide area.
"A girl was lying with us about four times."
"The career started in the 12 years when it was brought to us with 3.5 alcohol in the blood plus in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition in Hollywood at some dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't come at all strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the prime minister said.
I am not interested in parents or even their considerable tolerance to drinking their own offspring is considered the main cause of growing child alcoholism.
However, there is no point in speaking about the dependence in the right word, according to experts in children.
"A number of chronic addictions to alcohol are understood by alcoholics to all the phenomena that belong to it, and it's not for children."
"In those who use alcohol over and over again, there is a more significant undeclared family-social background," Prime Minister Pelikán explained.
According to lecturer Jurin this year at a pediatric clinic in Motole, approximately 40 drunk children were hospitalized in mid-November.
However, only those with heavy poisoning that had to stay in the hospital will get to the statistics.
Children who are taking their parents after an ambulance treatment, if they're at home, they're not counting on anything.
In addition to cases where children just sit around the school and drink a bowl of nuts, there are, according to Pelikán, three seasonal exercises on which you can rely: witches, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"It's either sorry for the wrong confession, or it's the beginning of the holidays."
"Even so, at the witch's house, I've lived at the reception of seven children's drinkers all at once," Pelikán said.
The drink that spends the night detoxifying under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically beneficial to the one who suffers from unpleasant coconuts the next day at home.
Early headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are due to the ingestion of glucose and the food that is missing from the body.
"They're actually better at it, because they have a beautiful evening experience and a good awakening and nothing bad."
"They're only confused about where they are," Pelikán admitted, sometimes giving patients a pleasant mood at least the cost that their treatment required.
The transport of sanitation and hospitalization on the emergency bed is also worth tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I applied it as an educational tool, when I then calculated to these children on a visit how much they had become drunk and that they could also spend the whole summer in the brigade to make a dinner," Pelikán added.
However, according to him, the health insurance system has a regressive approach, in which parents would impose treatment costs on children’s drinkers.
Two L-159 airplanes are first in the hands of foreigners in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft from the total of five pieces for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged the transport aircraft Casa C-295M took off on Tuesday to the Spanish Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It's the first thing the machines of this type showed up in possession of someone other than the Czech army.
In abroad, they have only been on exercises or performances for years.
It is a dual version of L-159T1, which has been operated by the Czech army and which have been able to fly.
The remaining three machines are the same L-159.
They are currently being served in the Aeru Vodochodya and the broker of the trade - Omnipol - took over them last week.
When the aircraft is physically exported from Vodochod, it is not known according to Jan Pejška from the press defence committee so far.
"One-stop L-159 airports for the exchange have been excluded from the long term of the aircraft saved, without any other deposits and investments by the Ministry's resort."
"Two L-159T1 were changed in the current state and form," said the Law of Pejšek.
He added that the army would not be left without two-ton aircraft, because in May 2009 the Ministry signed a 200 million crowns contract with Aerovochody for the conversion of four L-159 non-necessary machines into two-ton machines.
One new plane took over the army in July, the other takes over to the end of this year.
According to Pejška, EADS has committed to launching aircraft in the arms of some international countries.
"The contract clearly states that the L-159 aircraft carrier is EADS and will serve to train NATO pilots."
"That's why it's the things the receiver will do," Pejšek said.
The economic newspaper reported that, for example, the Spanish army of L-159 is of no interest.
The exchange of five L-159 for one airport Casa and the purchase of three more flights for 3.5 billion crowns approved by Mirka Topolánka last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not sign up for the purchase of the selection procedure and spoke directly to EADS.
The then defence management argued that the exchange would support future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and used only 24, the rest of them would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa's aircraft will probably have a trial run.
The European Commission, the Czech Ministry of Defence, complained to the European Court of Justice that the aircraft had to be selected on the basis of a pan-European trend rather than a single producer.
The army has already taken over three of Casa's flights, the last one to arrive at Kbely's Prague airport within fourteen days.
Longer indicator than ring means lower risk of cancer
Men who have an indicator longer than a ring are exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion to the study published by the British Cancer Journal on Wednesday.
It may be related to the male hormone testosterone level.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men up to 60 years," co-author of the study Ros Eeles, professor of cancer research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help to identify which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other dangerous factors such as family health burden, added Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time more than three thousand healthy men were followed by colleagues in Britain.
More than half of the participants in the study had a right-hand indicator shorter than a ring.
She paid them the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
In the case of those who had an indicator longer than a ring, however, this risk decreased by 33 per cent, and for men up to 60, it was down to 87 per cent.
The ratio of the two fingers mentioned - made in prenatal period - is likely to reflect the different levels of sex hormones that the child is exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous studies have shown that testosterone is just supporting increased prostate cancer.
The former Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Paques for the Czech Republic said that he usually knows about this study, but he does not seem to have a relationship between the length of his fingers and cancer.
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and on the walkways lies most of the burned snow, the roadmen in many places drove all night.
The D5 road between 89 and 93 kilometres in the morning is closed in the direction of Razvatov due to several car and car accidents, and D1 is also standing at Brno in the direction of Prague.
The driver of the Central Car Club (UAMK) told the news.
There was a truck crashing at 91 kilometers, a truck crashing at 93 kilometers, two trucks crashing, an accident caused an injury.
Several personal cars have also ended up in the basement.
Problems are also on the D1 road at 185 kilometers towards Prague.
Two trucks met there.
Drivers should ride close to Brno at 190 km or cross Brno and then drive at 182 km on Kívalce.
There are several kilometers of columns.
Also on the D11 road is an accident, and it's on the way to Prague.
In Prague lies a few centimeters of snow, temperatures show minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, the cars are built on Prosek, which is also attached to Szěrboholska.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Tramvaje rides late, for example, on a track between Karl's Square and Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis team is to be rescinded.
There are also problems with railways and airports.
The Czech routes had already had to cancel seven fast connections because of the snow.
Problems have, for example, a track from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroon.
Passengers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyna Airport was closed from 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most of the roads to South Moravia are already mobile, but only with increased caution.
In Viškovsk there are three roadways inaccessible, in Brnońsk there are snowflakes and in Blanensk there are some communications in the above-mentioned snow net.
The most deprived places were Viškovsko.
So far, there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Milosovice.
They'll have to put the frescoes in their hands.
When they're driven, they can't be estimated yet.
There is a need for caution in the White Carpathian region in Hodoninsk.
On roads that are only maintained by the inert sieve due to the protection of nature, it is up to a five-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, the most in the northern Czech Republic, many to 18 centimeters.
In Moravskoslejs region, about 15 centimeters [15 cm] of snow was attacked.
Snow is rising in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "wise weapon"
The U.S. Army has put in Afghanistan a new "wise" weapon, known so far only under the code-name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect that conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a little super-precious work.
Its missiles indicate a laser with accuracy of several meters.
Special rings of 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive market, actually work as small grenades.
The races can be programmed so that they explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trails.
It can therefore be used against an enemy hiding behind a barrier, a wall, or in a burial.
Because Shora is usually not protected, and when a deadly rain of steel strikes on him, he can get rid of it.
According to Richard Audetta, who participated in the development of XM-25, the new gun is the first weapon to be used by the "wise" technology.
"The soldier in principle follows her by finding a target, sending a laser beam to him, which determines the distance, so he gets a clear point of purpose, according to which he adjusts the measure and pushes the ball."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"If you press the trigger, the gun will go down and fire the gun at 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
Moves 400 jobs
The Fujits Group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees move their jobs in July next year from the current administrative building to the Marienbader-Namest in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese group of Fujits moves its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As in Wednesday, a giant in the field that specializes in computers and their maintenance, moved in July next year 400 men and women from their workplace from the modern administrative building in Marienbader-Namest in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the statement by the Fujista speaker, there should be another 100 jobs of the group that are currently being distributed in the region at a reasonable time.
The rental offer was that the astro Park's very attractive and large-scale offices are more suitable for employees' work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujits was just renting.
Competencer Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central site with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection with the airport is just as important to global society as Fujitsu.
The recent movement of an important business within the region brought joy yesterday in the winners and disappointments in the defeated.
The leading economic rapporteur in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that this was a successful "global player".
It's a fantastic expression of trust in this place.
The Fujitsu is suitable for the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwis (Green), regretted Fuji's decision.
The town was informed at the time by the company's management of its intention.
"Of course, we offered our help to companies," said Korwis.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the real estate tenant at the Marienbader-Namest.
As a result, there were decisive economic reasons.
It is now about preventing a long stay in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The house in Rathaus-Namest, which has been using Fujitsu, and the neighboring "Small Verticale" belonged to the other buildings in Marienbader-Namest ten years ago to the most debated construction intentions of the city of spa.
Between the station and the consultants there was a joint project of the city and a private designer called the city entrance, which was criticised for the massive construction of areas that had previously served as a parking lot and also for the height of buildings.
In 2001 the company of investment advice and rating Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujits' computer manufacturer, who was still connected to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired in 2006 by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and after a year were sold by the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu Group from Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it offers computers and servers available and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the area of Rýna and Mohan is one of the largest in Germany, but the largest employees in Fujits is in Munich.
From Bad Homburg moves to Frankfurt-Niederrad, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, other subsidiaries in this site will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
In the administrative building, Astro Park was rented for this purpose 7000 square meters.
In the complex - its name points to the star landscape, which is twenty years old, it also sits in addition to other central links of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon Server Killed - Threats Against Assangem
Wikileaks gets into tights.
The Amazon Internet service turned off the platform for detection on its servers.
It is possible that this has happened to the political pressure after the release of the secret diplomatic depots.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is allegedly held in the United Kingdom.
Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is getting under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their modern home server in America and are now searching for a home online in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And founder Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is led on the list sought by Interpol, is to be held according to a newspaper contribution in the United Kingdom.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free expression in the country of the free," the media announced a short news service on Wednesday (local time).
The Amazon Internet company recently downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used the publication of the Amazon Web Service (AWS) secret diplomatic depots to manage a high number of access to documents.
Twitter services have explained Wikileaks to this step: "Good - our dollars are now lost by hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's co-workers conducted the investigation, published CNN television stations based on Lieberman's information.
The president of the Senate Committee for Home Defense threatened Amazon with boycott, informed the British "Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to take this step earlier, given the earlier publication of the Wikileaks classified information," said the senator.
In the meantime Lieberman called for the ban on the use of servers in other countries as well.
"Vikileaks is an illegal, unscrupulous and unconcerned and thus our national security is being put at risk and threatens life on the planet," said a statement by the non-Side Senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand stolen material."
Founder Wikileaks Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities for suspected rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
Based on a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in the United Kingdom, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has always identified the investigation in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Speaking Wikileaks Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"Even the challenges were to kill Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is afraid of his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was apparently responding to the rulings from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee requested that the person responsible for publishing on Wikileaks be charged and corrected for treason.
In Canada, one of the leading government's advisers Stephen Harper said on TV - ironically, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use "target plane".
In the meantime, she broke up between the White House and Assange's literal shooter.
US Speaker Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "Laughter and absurd", that Assange asked the foreign minister to resign Hillary Clinton if he was responsible for the recently published Spanish diplomatic challenges.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of a man with websites," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are much more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now examining the security of its databases.
The Special Commissioner was appointed representative of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Action, Russell Travers, to the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of "necessary reforms in the structure", which are necessary after publishing messages from the sending to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review ways in which the entire government is exchanging and protecting information.
The US government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they should be in danger of publishing on Wikileaks.
"We've given them everything we need to get in touch with them," said the foreign ministry spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We're prepared to protect them, if it were necessary."
Ice-cream University
At "Gelato University" in Bologna, frozen sugars are being prepared for a better annual period.
The basic course for future icebergs, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does that ice cream actually come from?
Gelatier and Gelataio.
Gelatier, Czech a little old ice cream maker, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelatio will extract ice cream from the cooling box, put it on the counter and sell it.
To find out, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to find out more about the ice cream, this one won't get away with the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice-cream manufacturer established a ice-cream university to match the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
However, a number of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice are also offered in their own refrigerator.
Someone wants to be in their Midlife-Criss after a new career, others dare to be on the thin ice of their unexplained complaints.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all world powers - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the Ice-Cream industrial country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an iceberg in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman in Julia's home came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelleriere Luciano Ferrari will first explain the ideal properties of perfect ice cream to participants.
The decisive is not only a good taste, but also a sense of humor and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training at the Southern and Proprietary Shrine at the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it is still a remarkable dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients of milk, skimmed milk, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then cools immediately to four degrees.
Then it rotates on the machine with the chicken and runs out of pasteurised white basic cream, the basis of all kinds of milk frozen.
The teacher is immediately asleep with questions: Is it possible to produce ice cream only from natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can a person experiment on his own?
Luciano's warning to let the spirit of time go to the unknown.
Who's talking about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently used stabilisers - most of the natural product, such as guar molasses from guar bean.
Of course, it is possible to produce ice cream without stabilisers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will hit and the customer will have the ice grains itself.
Certain variations of the basic weight are allowed.
It'll be more intense with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sugar department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"The suppliers will try to use a lot of aromatized ingredients."
"But you should just experiment."
Be fruit sorbits with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or they'll freeze from the white basic mass, which turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa on the basis of a tender chocolate taste.
Now he's taking the ice-cream course.
Luciano will always produce four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and liscooric ice cream - either with eggs or without them in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will also be carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruity pears - in view of taste it is not always better.
Liscoorice ice must not taste more oscillating when it contains more oscillating nuts.
The most popular ice cream from the kiwi produces a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Only when the mixture is weighed will the right taste of Gelato rise, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely computational task: If broccoli is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe.
There's a need for extra sugar in lemon ice cream.
Luciano releases a device that determines the content of sugar in fruit (vines are measured from grapes).
Luckily, the tables make numbers easier.
The production of ice cream does not require as much body weight as before.
It does not only help the automatic production of basic mass.
There is also a device that simultaneously blends the ready-to-freeze mixture into the cream and cools on the lower temperature.
Despite all the automation, we don't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will drown himself and also his colleagues to the bottom of the fruit pear when he gets out of control by a huge mixer.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time when something like this happens."
Auditors in double light
The European Food Authority of EFSA is bound by an industry that experimentes with genetic plants.
This charge has now been expressed by a group of experts from Testbiotech, which is considered to be an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a spy theory, but we've documented it well," said the Chief of Testbiotech Christoph Then on Wednesday.
The Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and the other Efsa experts have been in a relationship with the Ilsa lobbyists for several years.
This one is funded by a group like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has taken a decisive part in the EFSA control rules for genetic plants and is thus in a clear focus of interest, criticizing Then.
The Efsa regulations are in full line with the Ilsi documents and carry the industrial manuscript that should be controlled by the Italian Parliament.
It's been a while since the Testbiotech's been pointing out to the target of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from the Eksa passed without any extras or a transitional period to the Swiss Farm Group Syngenta - and changed the parties.
The announcement for Central Germany (MDR) also revealed a recent personal link between the EU Industrial Lobby Control Agency and the EU's Environment Ministry and MEPs.
In the meantime, Efsa can't recognize the interest.
It works with all the serious data, i.e. those from industry, if they are highly skilled, is included in one declaration.
Experts who work for Efs are not required to have contacts with industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is itself designated as the neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - except for the assessment of the risks of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticise that at the present time genetically modified plants are allowed in animals without any feeding attempt, and that the response of genetic plants to the effects of the environment is not met.
"We want to know what, for example, will make genetically modified corn on the field," says Then.
The current practice is to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If they're not looking for a risk, how would it be possible to find them?" she asks Then.
Agreed to Angelika Hilbeck.
The scientific workshop has been examining genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical School in Zurich.
In this area, industry as well as in the United States is now trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe.
That's why there are almost no scientists who wouldn't be connected to the concerts anymore.
Most studies are not published that are critical for companies.
"Industry controls security research," Hilbeck thinks.
Stone level
Uli Gsell also ordered some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he stood in front of the station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It's snowing.
The story is known: In September the coppers arrived and began to shake a large part of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction.
When the building was stopped, most of the wings were in trouble.
Broken for 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
A weapon from Craigsheim, a soft, rough stone that was used in the years 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is an associate in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
He secured several of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He can't disappear."
It reads: "The cheap and poor stone, simple and original."
When one cut, he smelled like a cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with those pieces yet.
The stones have time.
Ollie Gsell, too.
The stock of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest at Tübingen on the former munitions of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought all the things that came up during the storm in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were to break up on a lock or disappear on a deposit," says in their office, a wooden vault, which was a former watchhouse.
They tell him that they put him in danger when in September in all the newspapers it became that he bought the remains of the north wing from a company that is carrying out a democracy.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for democracy.
And when this happens, it's the smartest thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21 opponents each about 80 kilograms of hard block, price per piece 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some are also hoping that he will return to the rebuilding of the building.
Rongen bought 500 tons, 25 big trucks.
Probably half of it's still in the woods, the rest of it's been sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all the corners and pulled what came into the trunk and the trailer.
The stones of the dispute from Stuttgart have long been transformed into "walls" or as edges of the branches of the plants.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political body."
He sits in his field car and goes for a ride after his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted study, later biology, then interested in computers and finally became a stone dealer.
And a rock lover.
It has 40,000 tons of stones stored.
He respects his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer with old stones in the Republic.
It's ugly.
In the snow, there's an artist-designed peacock.
"One of them belonged to the Marian Bridge in the Krajdjanes," he says.
The writer from Laba, yellow, warm, is excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're going up the road through the woods.
It points to a gathering: a red poet, a former part of the Karlsruhe station.
Come on.
"A nice travertine."
One of those flowers belonged to the Neckarstadion Tribune in Stuttgart.
There are stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt-travertin from the police office in Stuttgart, a red granite from the temple of Saint Blasien, a tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What a job, what a struggle, what a trip.
When Rongen is thinking about how the stones had been smashed by hand and carried over by simple stickers and bull transports, he becomes quite respectful.
"It'd be a shame if something like that was shaking."
He didn't become rich, very rich, not at all.
Today, a stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, in the woods, the stone workers, one baker, one cook, one glass and one gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the remains.
He's got to go to Cologne in due time.
The stones will be saved there, too.
Fighting talent about High-Possibilities
There's a lot of people at the funeral.
16 students are pressed with salmon bread, tomato soup and sweetness.
Technical University in Braunschweig and car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students to machinery and design at the workshop.
Together with the VW developers here they are going to talk about the car of the future - and only to know Volkswagen by the way.
Many companies are trying to compete for the smartest heads, as well as VW companies, to succeed and work together with universities.
Their mission is: What may first be recruiting the most likely graduates in the audiences, before they get to the labour market and will be interested in them.
Since universities do not issue any lists of success of their students, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in practical-oriented projects and get them.
At TU Braunschweig, the car company is trying to get talent the other day.
One young lady from the private department delivers prescriptions, rubber bears and boards with the VW logo.
He will tell the hopeful young talent about practical programs, student jobs and mark their way to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see the benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"The VW can meet students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates, and think about who would fit as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is, he fights so openly about the students.
"It was rather a major professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors companies can no longer choose their employees from long-term representatives.
On the contrary, they must try and try to impose particularly highly qualified workforces.
In particular, graduates of the engineering sector have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the German engineering team, the VDI remained in October unencumbered 40,000 engineering positions.
And according to the VDI forecast, the lack of engineers is still growing.
For the audit and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta is going to hunt for talent.
Organizes demanding Recruiting events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race where participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the United States next year.
Participants can also look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Before you decide in two rounds of choice who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested people will fly to the United States.
In the fight for High Potentials at universities they will be paid under the Dykty increasingly tougher laws.
"We want to be different with our race from the others."
"The simple trip to the shipyard was too little for us."
It seems that the hunter of the Dykta talent is lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all the participants like last year."
"Some will soon finish the study and plan to leave work with us," he says.
In addition to direct talk at campus, small and medium-sized companies are presented classicly on the labour market.
"We're trying to contact the graduates at the professional shows."
"As in Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, head of the personnel department of Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
The company from Bonn employs some 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
Currently, 35 posts are posted on the company's website.
"At the present time, it's just difficult to sit in free space."
"It's a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact with university professors.
Solarworld is working with various high schools, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that we can do practice or write a diploma."
The solar specialist does not arrange any expensive advertising.
Instead, the company is trying to attract other benefits: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Many groups often cannot offer it," says the head of the personal department of Stübe.
Looking for work doesn't play a major role anymore.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good procedural options are other crucial factors.
Solarworld held 55th place among 100 best employees in Germany in one study of the Institute Great Place.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, employees are asked how they are satisfied with their work and working environment and are monitoring the conditions of employees.
The head of the staff section of Stübe hopes that her placement will bring points to the employees.
"I think that stakeholders are particularly informed about the external evaluations of potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to see yourself as an attractive employer leads through his own employees," he says.
This is called the Internal Employer Branding, which means the launch of an employer on the market within the framework of his own employees.
"The satisfaction of the employees is the best of dispatches."
When the company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, they will make their own commercials to their employer between friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a tie game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil gardens
During the following years, there will be no new oil garden in the Gulf of Mexico on the coast of Florida, U.S.A.
The government in Washington has issued a corresponding ban - and this has abolished the previous plan with its final validity.
New gardens are now banned from the Atlantic coast as well.
Minister Ken Salazar told us on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should pay at least the following five years, is an explosion on the garden tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Prior to this accident, which became eleven employees of life and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled the pressure of opposition and industry to allow new gardens in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The hostages are trying to reduce the dependence of the United States on supplies of oil from abroad.
To this day, it is not clearly explained who is responsible for destroying oil in the Gulf.
In the middle of the criticism, the British energy group BP is confronted with billions of requests.
The investigation committee entrusted to Obama should present the results during December.
In October, the Minister of Interior Ken Salazar cancelled the return ban, which he paid from the explosion.
As a result, various oil groups applied for new gardening purposes.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters by strengthening controls and strict security regulations.
At present, there is a fundamental reform of the control authority, which has warned itself of many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would abolish the lucrative option of tax exemptions for oil and gas groups.
The industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will substantially reduce the volume of oil in the Gulf.
"The government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the gas and oil industry", the result of the current research in the BDO consulting sector - even before the ban is lifted in Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance still complains about the uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what the regulation is changing."
Investments in new business projects are being shifted to a decline in growth.
The Ogoni area is burning
The water in the rivers is oily, it smells like a pump: billions of litres of isolated oils have destroyed the nature of Ogoni in Nigeria.
People live by stealing, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari thinks so well.
"Don't worry," the journalist calms down the environmental activist: "Today you'll get enough oil mill in front of the lens."
37-year-old Nigerian was watching the attempt to photograph a boy who sails on his chest with water wrapped around his eyelids: the scene works in the waterlight with spiritual colors almost to the beauty.
It's not visible that under the surface of a blue hump of oil, it's not visible.
She used to collect enough yarn here, reports Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetti River.
In the meantime, the effluent water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a huge wave of oil flowed into the vast area of broken management.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must dive for at least six hours to get to the waters where the fish are: the area of Ogoni, which is located in the heart of the Niger delta, belongs to one of the worst frozen areas in the world.
The road along the river with the mangrove bays with many sideflows is just a familiar whole range.
The engine on the boat cooks the light water instead of the bag and whoever thrusts his hand into the water, pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of the mangroves are found on the ground as black spots of the doctor, rarely the trees in existence leave their leaves hanging sadly.
We're looking for a bunch of birds that are usually found in wet areas: Once the engine is quiet on the boat, it will spread in the previous paradise, where it smells like a pump, terrible silence.
"What's happening here is the environmental management of the war," says Regrettly Celestine Akpobari, "we live in constant fear of health."
The comparison to war is justified.
The area of the settlement of Ogoni is a battlefield where it has been fighting for several decades: more than 60 years ago the first inhabitants of Europe were involved here, in the 1980s, the first response to the later corrected writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it was extremely dangerous for employees.
To date, Ogoni must not return to the area of Ogoni: while the whole of the area of the delta of three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5,000 desirable gardens and 7,000 kilometres of management of more than two million black gold barrels, the oil field in Ogoni is lying in the area of Ogoni by ship, this situation is very unstable for the group.
Every hundred meters are covered by the steel structure of the water like the bizarre shoals: "Natural trees", so they are called very gently the heads of gardens.
They're 50 years old, most of them up to the sea.
Every moment, the head of the garden opens, reports Akpobari, and then flows a constant flow of oil into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres of oil have flown into the delta in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil that flowed into the sea in Alaska at the "Exxon Valdez" supertanker's adventure 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes about who is still responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell Group marks sabotage and organised theft of oil for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists speak of squeezing heads of gardens and rough guides as the main cause.
Shell requires much less safety regulations in Nigeria than is usual in the world, directed by US scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: Only the number of failures on the leaders is "a few times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks far away as a deserted, oil-sprayed factory under the wide sky, it comes out of the mangroves of the building: they are completely naked and up to the neck of the oil.
Under one of many of the courts, which are partly linked by management, partly voluntarily scattered throughout the country, fires fire: illegal small refinery.
The oil in the court over the fire heats for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
It flows from the lead to the gripping mass of gasoline, later the cape at the end of the kerosene and finally oil.
In this way, Michael and his four employees produce up to four judges per 300 litres a day: "We'll get 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The population of the deltas use a chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil country in black Africa.
Niger owns only one refinery.
Funnyly low price of EUR 40 cents per litre of oil can still be beaten by illegal producers: because they have raw materials for free.
It comes from the "bunkers", which connect to management everywhere in Ogoni: according to experts, the Niger River delta loses at least 16 million litres of oil per day.
But only a relatively small portion of the provisionally stored raw material will be illegally released: The largest proportion of organised criminal networks, to which politicians and high-ranking military representatives are also involved, are sold into tankers and sold on the world market.
In the debate, whether they caused the disaster of the inhabitants and their efforts or the lax way of production, Akpobari’s activist considered it purely academic.
"If oil companies were not considered to be firefighters and if they were not to destroy the vitality of fishermen, then there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, Ogoni's relationship with Shell is so damaged that it only takes into account the departure of the group: "Maybe other nations like the Chinese are as better."
Michael's going to be upset.
"The worst time to disappear," says the evaporator.
"At any moment, soldiers can come."
If they find a special military unit, they're not in danger of prison, but they're in pain.
Also soldiers, who come mostly from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to benefit from raw materials.
"Then the damn thing got our land in all respects to the bottom," Akpobari says.
Investigators found a dangerous construction error in A380 engines
A380 obviously has a major security problem.
The investigators found a possible construction error during a machine inspection that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The Qantas airline wants to appeal to the engine manufacturer.
Qantas airbus passengers were probably more fortunate at the beginning of November than they have been known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has found a high safety hazard in the engines of some A380 machines during its investigations - and now warns against possible construction failure.
The problem may have serious consequences: a single oil link could cause disturbances due to consumption, as this quarter was announced in the published statement of the ATSB.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce on 20 A380 aircraft.
These include the airbus of Qantas, which had to land in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It provided a justification for the complaint before the Australian Court of Justice in Sydney, which allows for further legal measures against this company.
The leader of Qantas Alan Joyce said his company would claim compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released and you damaged the nasal areas.
Rolls-Royce identified the cause of the damage to the burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be exchanged around the world.
Australian investigators announced that they will perform further safety tests with large aircraft equipped with the engines concerned.
Security recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, spokesperson ATSB Martin Dolan said.
The safety deficiencies were considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas, the airline left its fleet A380 for several weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa exchanged one A380 engine as a security measure.
Two-pass aircraft is the world's largest personal aircraft.
Global snow causes traffic chaos
All of Germany is white: almost snowing all over the country over the night.
On many roads, there are chaos, train connections and planes.
At least three people died in transport accidents.
Winter is freezing Germany: almost the entire Republic fell on Thursday night at freezing temperatures of snow - leading to many places of traffic chaos.
In the north and east it lies in some places up to 15 centimeters of snow.
On several roads and many roads there is a very limited transport.
At A7 in Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but it did not manage a new snowflake.
To that end, there was still a strong blasting wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Baltic Sea Coast of Schlesvik-Holštýnsk is expected to be a water-breathing force with a water status of 1.2 meters above normal.
The snowflakes in Saskatchewan caused major problems on roads and public roads.
According to the bad weather centre Meteomedia was therefore a degree of fear of violins in the Saska Switzerland - even the highest degree.
From there, a 30 - centimeter [30 cm] new snow came up, strong and fresh winds caused the wind to blow.
There were several expensive and personal cars left there at night.
In Saska-Anhalt, police authorities have also reported major road problems.
On A2 caused wind and snow slow operation and shock.
In Durynsk there were problems with snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German route, there are major difficulties in Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan-Anhaltsk, Durynsk and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on wheels, turned trees on wheels or broken top management and escape.
There must have been a stopover in Saska from Lipska to Nuremberg.
In Durin Saalfeld, he had to stop one ICE to Munich.
165 passengers received woolen blankets, food and drink from firemen and rescuers on the train.
Snow's wind rolled over the road.
In large German airports, snow winds have been canceled for many years.
According to the speaker, information centres for the years have already been reported from Munich's cancelled years.
In Frankfurt, after Mohan, it has been abolished for 40 years, according to the spokesperson for Fraport.
The maintenance of the roads is in a constant state of affairs.
Although there were only a few passengers left on the airport, 400 full beds were prepared for them.
On many roads there's been an accident on Wednesday night.
Tonight, one truck driver died in a train crash in eastern Holštínsk.
The engineer was easily injured.
Due to the snowy road, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: a truck was also caught here on a train ride because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver's dead.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until early hours.
And to that end, one 30-year-old woman died after her car was turned into a sloppy road at Ascherenburg.
However, meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light reading, and that is why the wind will rise in light bursts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only at the Baltic Sea there will be swift winds of the wind.
But it's going to be a big winter - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for twins
Deutsche Bank wants to say good-bye with its meaning: according to one newspaper contribution, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in the main headquarters in Frankfurt.
Real estate could cost up to EUR 500 million.
Deutsche Bank just renovated its seat of the group: the twins in the Frankfurt banking district were modernised; in the meantime, the bankers were able to go back to their old jobs.
Now, however, he probably wants the financial group to renovate again - and he's looking for buyers for both nightmares, as he informs "Financial Times Deutschland" with a call to the speaker.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We're still testing whether it's more meaningful properties to own or sell and then rent again," he said.
This is what the largest credit institution in Germany will give up its corporate home again soon.
The bank took over the twins only in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of its own fund and then refurbished them in a cost-effective way.
Energy reconstruction has been reported to be around EUR 200 million.
The sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
The experts in the field estimate the value of the tower between the "Greenowers" and the price of about €500 million.
The speaker said it was not decided whether the building would be resold to the property of the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of dust for dead miners
More than 10,000 people have been remembered by sleepwalkers in New Zealand, who have been declared dead after several explosions down.
Still unable to release the dead, because the safety situation is still complicated in the drawer.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a strong explosion in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were packed down.
In the case of an accident, the probe was released, but there was no trace of life.
For reasons of high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not be achieved for safety reasons.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts came from the fact that the miners no longer have a chance to survive.
Still couldn't get rid of the dead.
Now they remember dead relatives and friends.
Ten thousand people gathered for the solar weather in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand.
They shut up for two minutes.
The 29 tables, helmets, lamps, and the names of the ovens were built to honor the memory of the sleeping ovens.
Also images and personal things, such as clothes and surfing plots, have found their place here.
In state government buildings, there were half-hungry flagships.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come out of the "deep ground" again on the surface, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key, told the participants of the memorial event.
"But they never came home."
He couldn't say goodbye to his son until he saw his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was stabbed down.
A number of foreign diplomats have also taken part in the Memorial event, except for the Prime Minister and the relative victims.
During the October 19th explosion, British and South African miners were also attacked.
The rescuers started by firing fire inside the coal pit on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the poisonous gas is released, it begins to cool the high temperatures inside, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warriors!
Is it the horror of an art movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to recapture the old border with his battle eposium "Wallalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn mean when he was playing Wallalla Rising?
The captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his torturers and in great measure they kill with the supernatural force of their opponents - it is ideal for young ladies watching who are looking for bloody acts, because our hero helps with cruel methods of killing and his enemies fight even the inside of the belly of life when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, as it is actually called, the whole film does not say a word, and the other characters say at least one or two words, or let them stop touching the passionate dying screams.
In other words, it is silent and horrid in the beautiful hilly area of Scotland, which offers a world of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for the adult enthusiasm of cinema with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera recordings.
It's good if he has more target groups, it's only bad if they shut down each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylish trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered Danish version of director Quentin Tarantina, but stands out against his works to be closer to either a more humorous main stream or a less brutal art audience.
Most of the proponents of the art cinema are likely to be dealt with by the squeezing brain and the interiors everywhere.
The participants in the action films will be released no later than the moment when the One-eyed is released for clear reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of ships to Jerusalem and will remain hanging all the time in the wind and noise before it seems to add manpower to America and remain silent there.
So it's not surprising that in Germany, Wallalla Rising didn't get into a movie and now it's only been released on DVD.
It's mainly damage to beautiful images, but it's also because it's a personal facade, places to shed blood, it's hiding an exciting movie that deserves a little attention.
In this film, it's not about dialogue or the exact event, it's all an atmosphere, a hot dream that became a film.
And it's not for a runaway viewer.
The reef does not harm him even the moment of relaxation and slowly breathes him with its cold shots and a cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, especially the unsubstantiated hater that blows from the heart.
Only a little blonde boy who helps One-Oké, leaves something like innocence, all the others are driven by evil.
Of all the greatest one, the hero whose motives will never be explained, who will become the time for enemies and the Transitional Union a warrior from hell, perhaps a messenger of the Devil.
It makes a loss, but maybe it's just for the wounded.
Wallalla Rising is a mysterious film that is possible to hate and admire, for anger, excitement and admiration.
It's an emergency.
Dedicated groundwork
The IAEA Nuclear Power Agency has a new focus on the secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country, however, refrains from expressing itself - and does not allow control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli warplanes F-15 I will attack a mysterious quarter building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of the Euphrates; the nearest city is 30 kilometres away and it is called Dair as-Saur.
The documents of the International Nuclear Power Authority (IAEA) shall appear on its name when they are referred to as a reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this quarter hidden in the valley that turns away from the current.
Based on the announcement of the CIA's US Foreign Secret Service at the end of April 2008, a reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well placed on the production of plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
Fifty-year-old technology doesn't fit anything else.
The CIA presented video with unencumbered satellite images.
Computer animation has explained where the components of the reactor could be prior to destruction should be a reduced copy of the North Korean nuclear model of the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
In addition, there were still photographs showing the building close to or even inside.
The reactor was just short before the launch, but it's still out of fuel.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, there's not much more than ten times, even the fights have increased over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that the CIA had been very sure before the attack that Syria was building in an el-Kibar reactor, but basically had no basis for the country's "active nuclear weapons program".
Some of the reporting secret services in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of a "reputable reactor", although CIA presentations consider it "reliable".
They lack clear evidence, as well as the IAEA.
On the question of how certain he has a reactor ahead of him, a senior UN diplomat answered in summer, the IAEA has "a supply of material to ask questions".
The net reportedly "unused military buildings" was quickly removed by the Syrians, and the area was also properly leveled.
However, in June 2008, the IAEA team was able to find themselves under the leadership of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar uranium footprints produced by people.
In addition, the IAEA received a satellite photo of commercial sellers through the Member State from the time of the attack which should be more extensive than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these recordings are not on the market because they were bought exclusively by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
It is therefore not possible for the IAEA to confirm their integrity.
Syria has always claimed that she never had a secret nuclear program or a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, Damaszek said.
However, it failed the IAEA after the analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damaszek has been refusing to discuss things - as well as satellite images.
In addition, he banned auditors from second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the trouble-bombed buildings.
But Israel is also in a state of silence.
"We will never comment on it," the recent official opinion of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert confirmed.
The investigation of this case will be carried out without delay since June 2008 and "remains in a serious problem in view of the authority's credibility", as the senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admitted - it is, however, a serious breach of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which the IAEA monitors.
The IAEA considers the key to further progress in the case of three other devices that are to be "in functional connection" with the given reactor - and, unlike it, they still exist.
At the same time, the auditors have not done so far, nor have they any function or reason to be suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally designates itself as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, taken again by nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found them on satellite images of buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is likely that there is an inner or immediate proximity to the military base - for this reason Syria rejects IAEA's access to these three sites.
In Vienna it sounded that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would have been previously sent to burn down the military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the U.S. secret service facility.
The IAEA has bases and satellite images that transport material here and there between these three places and the quarter of the Euphrates.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one facility should be "in relation to fuel production".
However, there is no "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. about the enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium, which is not enriched.
Where does that uranium come from, and where it should later decompose plutonium on the bomb, there are only possible estimates on these central issues.
It is also not known whether the items that might hide important traces are stored in these three places.
As if they had disappeared from the surface of the earth’s hundreds of cargo cars, no one seemed to have any information where the net came from.
Only a few kilometres away from el-Kibar and on the other side of the Euphrates lies the salt duty of al-Tibni, which left Syria to check in 1998 as an appropriate stock for radioactive waste, considered the IAEA as unlikely.
Former inspector IAEA Robert Kelley put him in touch with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
Images from space show, however, that after requesting access from the IAEA, Syria carried out all suspected groundwork and removed large containers.
It could have been an accident, but it couldn't explain the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months setting up a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only this effort shows how much interest the auditors are.
In the meantime, the lady also rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna have calmed down the fact that the reactor is destroyed, and therefore this thing is not burning, the US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections, which is one of the most robust means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to launch controls.
Chief IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already spoken of "the possibilities to which I am staying in the future", but he is still weighing.
This option poses a major risk: on the one hand, the majority of the IAEA Governing Council is needed, and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything?"
Love at the time of war
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on the still unrestricted residential facilities in summer, problems have arisen.
She wrote a script herself, it's about the loving story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
He doesn't know much more about it yet - but that's also causing unrest.
They're still talking about the Muslim woman who loves her during the war in Yugoslavia to the Serbian man who raped her.
The Bosnian women's societies immediately protested, so the planned film from Sarajevo to Hungary moved quickly.
In the meantime, the film has been filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but in Bosnia it is still protesting.
Bakira Hasecic from the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote through the UN organisation to help UNHCR refugees Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, now reported the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also a UN-declared refugee aid organization.
She's not exactly diplomatic - she offered women weeks ago to meet in Hungary, but they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
In the camps where she was raped, the story of mercy was ignored, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victim shows enough about the scenario.
Her organization therefore advised the UN to help refugees, so that Jolie misses out as a high school student, the Guardian informs.
What exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has been given permission to read its script, has followed a smaller move in Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author stresses that there is no political intention in his film that she has made a great effort to commit to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all the parties involved.
Because of its content, it remains uncertain.
There is another version of the film on the Internet that sounds really different: the lovers knew themselves before the war began and met again when she was as a Bosnian Muslim dragged into the Serbian camp, where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds a lot different than "the victim of rape falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie's really starting before the war is true.
Jolie argues that there is a pressure on her, which is "not fair and based on misinformation".
Now they can release them from Hollywood's hackers: By publishing illegally on the Internet her script, as they have done many times.
Nothing to go on.
This evening it's good for Iry once again.
He doesn't even walk through grief.
The home team has a lot of power over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout joy for the sound of loud music, their feet ass.
Bailey-Pub in South Cork is hot, because players throw tennis balls three meters away into beer cans - and they hit.
"Privní pong" is called a bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and to that end a ticket to Las Vegas for the world's beer pong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this excited beer game and portable computer, it doesn't work very well together.
However, the 26-year-old man is trying to have fun, to answer the heavy question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to play passion in Las Vegas, he's going to New Zealand in January.
"I have such a strange feeling," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Yet: His friend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "he immediately got his dream job as EventManager, maybe it's a good sign," says a young man and smiles.
Because of poor sights at home, they have tried their luck abroad for two out of three Tanner relatives.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now serves as an IT consultant in London.
Boys leave: Like Tanners, it looks like a lot of families on the island.
100 000 Irish leave the country at a reasonable time, the experts of the scientific institute for the economy and social affairs of ESRI in Dublin predict.
They even count to 2015 with 200,000 immigrants.
For such a small land with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar exhilarating wave that Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of rising, which brought great blessings to the Irish people, discontent is growing again.
The economic crisis destroys, above all, the young, educated Iry, who have only experienced a return.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in these years.
Everyone needed it, the money was too much.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men within 30 years are unemployed.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers who complain: "Everything goes from mountain to hill in Ireland."
"It should come up against politicians and bankers - whoever can, it goes away and our country loses the whole generation."
"The last one to die, please."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black, because the government is just lying and the young people do not offer any prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but have no strategy to create new jobs," says 20 years.
He notices her associates moving from one unpaid practice to another.
Her greatest concern is that she will have to move herself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnnon are trying to see the subject positively.
McLarnnon organizes a "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers an overall service on the topic of foreign work.
"For beginners in the labour market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps on a career score," says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
About what it's like to build something somewhere else, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues for construction in Germany.
He's just building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he goes to Hannover or to Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan gets a rare home because he works in extra shifts so he can pay home a loan on the house.
"Sometimes the situation is really a little crazy," he says, when the first time in a long time exceeds the threshold of his own home.
"I'm making money in Germany at home in Ireland, where I'm basically not."
She laughs naked and walks in cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, parked in the entrances of a large expensive car.
O'Donovan bought a house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100% financed by the loan.
"It was a crazy time, easy money was without a lot of questions," he says.
She's afraid it wouldn't have been good with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, comes down with hot tea, and says, "I don't have the kids that I have to live and I'm young; even if it's all wrong, I can start again."
The construction engineer doesn't like a call that he's hearing so often.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"Sometimes working abroad, it's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like the Irish."
She laughs and then tells about her father, who left for the last economic crisis in England.
"After seven years he was back again and his life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep your future open and just wait for how to develop your life elsewhere.
He's been working in London for several years, and why shouldn't it be in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend as well?
But there's one more thing that worries him pretty much in these days, celebrating his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might get used to a wedding party.
"Principally no emotion," he says and drinks a good beer.
"Good-bye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a departure celebration, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common Practices of Democracy
The support of democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private business.
Punctuality causes greater anxiety than unemployment.
And Brazil regards many regions as more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarometer survey that took place in 18 countries and came out exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it is possible to monitor changes in situations across the board.
In this survey, which took place in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first of them is that Latin America has a rather happy mood.
The second is to increase stability of positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
The support of democracy in several countries across the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth averaged 6% annually since 2002, the support for democracy increased from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
She also grew up in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a deep decline in last year’s production.
But only about half of the people in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most popular areas, are democratic convictions, reaching the regional average (see Graph 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in their country of practice, it is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001 when it was 25%, it is a big increase (Graph 3).
The 34% survey stated that they believed in the snow in their country and 45% believed in the government, again being the same numbers as last year, but it was a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis was undermined by democracy in Latin America.
Support arose during the global financial crisis probably because of the fact that many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the stronger social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and decreased again to 32% this year.)
However, the slope changes widely from country to country (see Graph 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President, Luize Inácia Luly da Silvy, is reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the violent criminal activity worsened.
Only once since the polls began, more respondents across Latin America see as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see Graph 5).
The strike 31% says that either they themselves or their close relatives have become victims of criminal activity last year, but this is a decrease compared to the data 38% from last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
The more massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private business and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region say that private business is necessary for development, this percentage increased by 56% from 2007 (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that enables their countries to develop, this percentage grew from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelan respondents have the same opinion (and 80% support private business), although their left-wing President Hugo Chávez has many private companies.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in the area as mentioned by 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, versus last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, and Venezuela is pleased with the success of Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Critical Options
No one expected the general elections in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were far worse than outsiders who were trying to help the affected country to fear.
Elections marked the filling of the hours and repeated voting, ballot cards distributed by channels, broken electoral rooms and intimidation.
Election rooms opened after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced for the reason of the ice earthquake, have wandered around and tried to find out where they could go to vote.
Some of them finally gave it up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a few pre-supposed predecessors, shouted that this was a fraud and called after the election was cancelled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
Despite Edmond Mulet, a highly-established United Nations official in Haiti, said that "in many respects it was quite a good choice."
Observers from the Organization of the American States and the Caribbean Community have carefully said that "they do not believe that these imbalances, regardless of their seriousness, did not necessarily have to cancel the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, whose opposition votes are committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing President and his candidate Jude Célestin, shall announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is planned for ice.
All the election hopes are not lost.
Two former opposition candidates Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, withdrew from their original challenge to declare the vote invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support between the voters, is marked by the electoral commission for reaching the decisive battle.
Because of the regular epidemic of hell and more than 1 million people who still live in the states after the earthquake, fear that the election will be low.
After all, many Haitians wanted to vote, but for the sake of disorganization, they were prevented from doing so.
A total of 250 thousand IDs necessary for voting have been left undistributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot in the barn.
Gifts see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a fundamental step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it's clear, then, that the Haitians are on their own.
In the center of the point
In the weeks, when suddenly the widow, Cristina Fernández, the Argentine President, was moved by public sympathy when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this success into a successful campaign for the second term of office in elections next year may depend on whether the grieving Mrs Fernández gives incompatibility to her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And it's all going to be based on these signs.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, was accustomed to drawing up budgets that undercut tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to lose further income according to their liberty.
Mrs Fernández's government lost most last year in Congress.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized at the death of Mr. Kirchner on October 27th.
Some members of the ruling political movement Peronist joined Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic sessions (at which the government was involved in the counterfeiting and accusations of corruption), Congress was unable to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to come," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also be paid for next year, with the President having more space to lose as a result of the librarianism.
The economy is overheating: this year is likely to grow to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about a figure that is close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the office in 2003, when Argentina narrowed its economic collapse, set a priority on growth and poverty reduction rather than on inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, charged the private sector and cleared the INDIC, a statistical agency that came to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now stop this policy?
She called for a discussion between private businesses and committee remittances.
And her officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the growth of world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation disrupted the growth based on a major devalvation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is aware that he wants to restore Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government has established an agreement with the debtor who previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Now, President Fernández has a deal with the religious governments that are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted on not having this reality under the supervision of the IMF as usual.
But last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index that would remind you of the introduction to clean up INDIC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of the term of office, when the husband is no longer on her side.
If you want to stay, you need to get the support of the middle class, which is tired of the church.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from the summer holiday they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it is not necessary to speak quietly to many of the opinions that her husband stood up to in politics.
Half-incentives for China
The Taiwanese voters are closer to the close connection to the fortress.
How does Taiwan feel about its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million people, 70% of those entitled, elected on November 27th the mayor and city councils in five urban districts, which can be considered to be a broader assessment by President Ma Ying-jeu.
Mr. President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that have prevailed and have been strongly established in business relations, including in part free trade agreements, in the greatest reconciliation of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed a test, but only tight.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) finished winning three out of five mayors, she was unable to win most of the votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is more independent of Taiwan, received almost 50% of all votes against 45% of KMT.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's voting rate has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was together with KMT in city councils.
Elections were played as a majority of Taiwanese elections, which include sound election trucks and mass assembly with flags with low dressed girls.
Part was even a secret attempt to assassinate.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chana, honorary president of KMT, was agitated for KMT candidates in the pre-election evening.
The man in the van shot young Mr. Lien right through his face, wounded her and killed the viewer.
It was by no means determined whether the armed man intended to harm Mr. Lien or to settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, claims that the shooting has affected the elections, the suspect falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards the KMT.
Probably the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how she remained in the background of the question of the foundation itself.
Instead, the candidates interfered with plans for state-owned housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hatred for China's military threat.
So KMT tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also left behind the incitement of anti-Chinese positions.
It is a response to reality and is aware that Chinese trade has a key role to play in Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
From the government in Beijing it can be expected that it will continue in commercial payments, together with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to its state.
China did not waste time sending the negotiator to Taipei to set up a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course they would also like to see political integration, but in particular.
It will be better to wait for the 2012 presidential elections.
In any case, the DPP found itself.
Two years ago she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The President in 2000-08 was a champion and a leader of clear independence.
But under Mrs. Tsai's leadership, a new generation has developed, which is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms. Tsai was called as a DPP candidate for the president, such as Su Tseng-change, who was standing under Mr. Chen.
Their parties are now doing everything they can to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms Tsai published plans for research institutes that serve as a contact point between DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without previous conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party is a "confidential alternative" to Mr. Ma's surprising approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry with this move.
In his declaration, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would be better off if they claimed that Taiwan was a single country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, pragmatics, not to give up on the president.
But even without Mr. Chen's involvement, the DPP will fight the choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's assessment was wrong, even though it was too fast of economic growth; KMT's candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
His disfavor seems to be based, in particular, on unemployment and deepening the gap between the rich and the poor.
The spokesperson KMT says he reorganizes his cabinet, as well as the local sidewalks.
Strongly encouraged proposals for Taiwan's support for friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonia Chiang, the prominent advertisingman, "the point from which there is no return has already disappeared."
Award for Grammy: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
The President's request and the people must observe the law.
Esperanza Spalding, 26 years old jazz bassette and singer, chosen by President Obama to attend the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is marked as one of Grammy's surprises in this year with the best new artist nomination in the category.
Since Spalding has been celebrated on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" came out, it came a little late, but it's in accordance with Grammy's rules, when the artist must not issue more than three albums before "the public identity of the given artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 "Chamber Music Society" certainly recorded a step forward and thanks to her carefree vocal style and hand-held with the elements of the pop, funk and Latin influence, we can talk about Spalding as the success that Norah Jones recorded in 2003, the closest equivalent for voters in Gramma who are looking for similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
The other jurors of Grammy rightly rated the album Vijay Iyer Trio "History" in the category of instrumental album, exciting, refreshing the ride of the album, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against James Moody's experienced saxophoneist "Moody 4B" and John Beasley's keyboardist "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a brave favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in the HBO "Treme" series was rated in the current jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to Stanley Clark's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society has won several worthy recognitions in the category of large files, when in competition the chamber jazz Children Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octopus "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how to have the base free hand as a chapel.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
The classic music nominations have a wide collection of musicians and composers from all over the world at the 53rd Grammy annual prices.
The leading position in the nomination has Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" for piano and orchestra, with the number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", eclectic orchestral work, with the number of three points.
Among those nominated to serve in Southern California were Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The founder of L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance to appreciate.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories that include orchestral, opera, assembly and solo recordings.
The category for the producer of classical music year has five nominees, including Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Bruckner and his Symphony were awarded 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals project; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" introducing various artists; and Verdiho "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for the category of operas, the nominations are Berg and "Luu" from Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" from Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" from Orchestra and Chorus of the Marine Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" from BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers who are nominated to Grammy for contemporary compositions are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daughterty for "Deus Ex Machine," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatto Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had a premiere at Disney Hall in January 2009 at the show, which was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salonen.
About 30 minutes' work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnet Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for an instrumental soloist show with an orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he had written a 15-minute work specifically for the Mandolin Avi Avital, who was performing at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble with a residence in New York City.
"I wrote it with the help of sounds from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone conversation.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, received nominations in the category for orchestral performance, led by Chicago Symphony in recording the work of Stravinska.
Among the instrumental soloists who received the nominations are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; perch Paul Jacobs; housekeeper Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented among the nominated vocal soloists this year, namely Anne Sophie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the class transition category she won the soprano nomination by Jesse Norman for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mix in Temecule is approved by the Planning Commission
The planned mix in Temecule received unanimous support from the local planning commission over five hours of intense public witnessing.
Critics attacked the project that promotes terrorism and will lead to a stop to trade.
However, the jury decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre is in accordance with local laws and will be aesthetically effective.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you remember," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" added.
"Those who are opposed only shout loudly."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The event began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost midnight, when most of the time they held discussions with people who were for or against the center. These voices were evenly divided, says Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the website of the news.
"There is no America," one comment appeared.
"We are the planet monkeys with Socho's freedom falling into the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centre also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including the vicinity of Ground Zero, a place of tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists were attacked in New York.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community of about 135 families was located in Riverside County for years without an incident, but wanted more and more space than the storage space that was rented together with the producer of filtering systems.
The new mix of dimensions of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minerals and will grow to the height of 43 feet.
It should take place about 4,32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of the Chaparral High School.
As regards the project, opponents can still appeal to the City Council.
Microbes with arsenic resistance increase the possibility of new types of life on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients extends space to look for new forms of life on Earth and perhaps still.
Researchers have discovered unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has options that are beyond the main elements that have been considered and fundamental to date.
"This organism has a dual capacity."
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
"This reality is very special, but it is not evidence that it is a form of truly 'foreign' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared Thursday in the online issue of Science magazine.
It has long been considered necessary for the life of six main components - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, scientists have found that bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow once the arsenic is replaced by phosphorus.
"You're starting to wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for finding life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life may look like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, a report on this newspaper was published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, and called for widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of foreign life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms can be able to use other elements that run biochemistry and that now the elements that we consider to be 'standard' must not be so necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with other elements in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't an accident.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, which conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of arsenic.
Arzen and phosphorus are very similar chemical elements, so they thought that the microb that is exposed to both elements can be able to replace each other.
"Arzen is poisoned mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can hardly separate these elements from themselves."
"Also arsenic is so different that it does not work like phosphorus. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenic that are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better in the action of phosphorus, but given that they can also survive with an arsenic replacement, the possibility that the form of life that uses arsenic may appear naturally, whether elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or month, where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an expert microbiology assistant at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, is not new, but there was never an example to which this reality would prove.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on earth, she said, and the scientists speculated that she could use her earlier life forms.
"This means that there could be other ways of creating life, not only the way he was created in the early era of the Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining thefts of dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibit dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower motel were found.
Four exhibition dogs - two hours and a tall pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at Motel Bellflower 6, told the authorities.
Two dogs were found in the middle of the afternoon and two dogs were left in the middle of the night late, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles police department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," said Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, at which location, did not share any detailed information regarding their findings.
"Research continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not arrested to speak for the case.
They had great joy when their two hours in the middle of the afternoon were found on a flight to Downey.
The sheriff's representatives found van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Action Trace, three-year-old Trace dog and 10-month-old didi, were unharmed, reported to the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the tribe of Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who had planned to participate in this week's district competition on behalf of their Japanese owners, were not found until their appearance late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are this weekend in town to attend AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs had to compete in other competitions planned on the days before the show AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on almost a month's travel by dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered at the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - the dog boxer, the Parson Russell terrier and the British oven - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Action and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened the windows a little bit so that dogs in the car would have enough fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported car theft at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who took them to missing dogs, dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
It wasn't clear on Thursday if prices were to be paid.
Lev is ready to scream again now that the restructuring of MGM is obtained from the final approval court
After 18 months of earthquake and insecurity, MGM finally got green so it could start again.
On Thursday, the Federal Insolvent Judge of New York officially blessed the "before the packaged" plan of creditors to balance about $5 billion in debt and clean up the road for 86 years of the old entertainment company, which focuses on the production and production of films and television shows.
Fourthly, the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. competition order does not leave MGM any legal impediments so that the founders Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum can be re-launched, which will become the main leaders of the simplified study.
The number of employees will decrease by about 320 from the originals to more than 400.
MGM does not come out of Chapter 11, until JPMorgan Chase agrees on the planned financial resources enabling a loan of $500 million to finance the new operations and production of MGM.
Now it's a connection with an investment bank that itself needs $75 million and funding is expected around half December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when Moelis & Co. was hired by the investment bank to advise management on how to resolve its finances, since management was fighting to allow interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, the former CEO of Enron and the professional director of the company, known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelise and Cooper's attempts to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 study believers lasted much longer than expected.
After a few months of discussion, the parties agreed that by the end of 2009 they were selling the company.
Although auctions attracted a number of stakeholders, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus funding that believers demanded.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the cracker and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the believer at the end of October.
When MGM officially resigns from the competition in the following weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive $9.5 million.
Co-operatives who are indicting for their services that run the company, $375 000 a month, will receive a reward for their success, i.e. "success fee" $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to renew production in MGM, which only released one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will be released in early 2012.
They are also planning to participate in the financing of two films whose presentation will be the "Hobit" book, along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of these two films that Peter Jackson will direct.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debts, was looking for the possibility of joining Lions Gate Entertainment, which is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not reach an agreement.
Technology toys that keep your budget on the balance
This year's leading candidate is the most amazing iPad player that follows the video game system. In both cases, it is a significant contribution to the gift budget.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five rounds of BMX for $99 and one game Kinect stands the same as 10 coral pliers or about 48 kilns Play-Doh.
But there's a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toys salesmen - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law is working; this year's technological toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not lower, compared to the past years.
While relatively less new games have appeared with associated websites, two of the most famous players of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button battery increases, as well as the battery player.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices indicated are from Toys "R" Us, except for cases otherwise specified.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, 3 years old) are lye animals that sing when you press them.
At one compression, the animal plays a tone and the other print begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start playing, you can't stop.
The best choice in singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, 2 years)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animated doll from Elmo Live technology, which can play Simon Says and can also take a month's walk thanks to its innovative closed leg with wheel-blocking.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor's toy, even though their parents complain about lack of voice control.
If you are an 80-year-old child, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational games.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years old), with a bucket full of quiz cards that are designed to turn the car into a fun with work with a self-corrected, funny work bag.
If you send a smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$ for children from 3 to 8 years of age) is the cheapest option with simple use, with qwerty keyboards, although games do not have as effective teaching as Leapster Explorer (70$ for children from 3 to 12 years of age), the first significant change in the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years old) uses iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children from 8 years of age) is a file of five cubes that are not larger than a box than a lighter, each of them has an LED display.
The aim is to create words by placing the cubes in a row before the time runs out; it is great for competition in improvised word creation.
Even more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
At the highest level, two Webkinz players and Club Penguin were represented in toys.
If you want your child to buy an online game from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains coins with hidden code.
When you activate the online code, your child will get enough credit in Club Penguin store on any two items.
This could include a wheel brush or a puffle animal.
About something a little bigger than your toothbrush is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years old), the latest in a number of microbots on a button battery.
Brouk moves fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It's fun when you do the puzzle from the bone and watch if he can find his way out.
He's also very strong.
Our guy was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time at the bottom of our dog.
Introducing closer police control in China
As the city's military instructor, Tang Shenbin went to the square, strictly controlled his orders and issued orders with the military authority.
He wanted female members - Chinese state-run urban detachments, worried and reversed for their hard moves and violence - to make certain impressions on the noises surrounding them.
"Stand straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, shut up, "How beautiful girls look!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive caps and pants were put on notice.
Four pairs of black boots are sorted as according to the vertebrae.
Four head coverings perfectly sit on the hair that are perfectly bound by blue and white stems.
"I personally think they look average," said Mr. Tang.
"Models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of the city’s overseers in China.
One city ordered new branches to have higher education.
The Guangdong province has changed gray-green uniforms into a much more attractive blue.
In the middle of China, Wuhan replaced the contested view of the strong weapon: in 2009 it was reported that 50 officers surrounded the vehicle with the swings and looked at the owner with a look at the rear seller packed and left for half an hour.
Xindu, a city period of 680,000 people in Chengdu, was the main image of the operation.
Since 2003, he has supplemented his city police with 13 women who have been selected specifically from their perspective, consistency and youth.
The aim is to show the police's softer, women's side in addition to the rough side of the police.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson himself would have had trouble getting to the secret Chinese city groups.
They'd argue criticism for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to promote the city's declaration, to impose fines and other administrative measures.
But Chinese media usually capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the province of Hubei turned an uninterested viewer to death after he used his cell phone to film how they began in the protest case against the shipyard.
Last year, police training was held in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual, there was a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrators without a blood mark.
This year, a underground businessman with melons in Shanghai got into a fight with five policemen and suffered a left-handed brain injury.
A video game full of violence that can be downloaded online shows Chinese police officers how they attack street salesmen.
"Chenguan scared the government," China Daily, national edition, called last year for further discussion on tactics.
There was "a really thorough cleaning" on the paper.
The skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After a period of interest in eight new women's police officers in October, the head of the Beijing Evening News was wondering whether women had real obligations or were just disillusioned.
The answer seems to be from both sides.
The period required women from 18 to 22 years of age with a good attitude and "five faces in the right proportion."
Adepts should be higher than the average - above 1.6 meters.
An exemption at age 26 is mandatory.
Officials claim that work is psychologically too demanding for women over 25 years of age.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unnamed police officer at Rednet.com, like government websites.
"The candidates must first demonstrate the external qualities, which then determine others, are among them the height, weight, face, etc."
Then it comes to a number of qualities and "internal qualities".
Women are like flower waxes, he said and added, "In addition to being bound, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, the deputy director of the city's management, disagrees very much with this description.
But he argued that the requirements for height are also common in China for other jobs, both sexes.
Just like a requirement for a uniform face picture.
Which means that the question of a good look is between the Chinese subject of discussion.
Health problems or freezing will certainly not apply.
"He cannot allow us to serve a chrome or a man's back," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps watch at Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, face like an apple and a well-formed mouth.
She doesn't know that the focus on her view could have been a sessistical race, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked herself with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with the streets, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our task is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just launching traders into a street where they can perform their activities.
Each morning, a group stands against more than ten traders who walk or on wheels and tries to sell as many noodles and tofus as possible before they are removed.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you so many times!" said Ms. Xu, when he started running away, and for a time he left his bike with a car with nozzles.
Policemen describe their duties as more monotonous than ours.
"Every day is basically the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in his free marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that women policemen have no power as their male opponents to entertain the goods.
They can only threaten to report the facts to their male leader.
The trend is then to protect them from sudden public manifestations of hostility against official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, exploded after false news about police killing the sellers.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the hours of the night; 14 government vehicles were turned over or burned.
Xinda's escaped this kind of violence.
But peace can be guaranteed only by gravity.
Only two blocks from the quiet town of Baoguang, where police officers were watching this morning, more than 50 people gathered on the corner of the street.
The police had fun playing a motorcycle that was fixed on the sidewalk at the inside of the store, as required by the regulations.
The car owner could cry as he wanted.
15 minutes' distance from the police station, facing the drain, with the wheels against the vehicles and quickly off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator of the male group, remained behind, his white mark turned around to hide his name.
Like women police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 years of age who already have only a helpful role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in the maintenance and storage of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li forever.
"Mostly it's a public that starts with it."
Prosecutors will not accuse Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of the criminal charge concerning his affair with his former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure the lobby, announced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision concludes the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, the Nevad Republican, faced and was, until the time of the scandal, considered a potential Republican candidate for the president for 2012. His affair had reached national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said it was a decision that followed almost after the annual investigation, "really pleased".
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings before the Senate's ethical committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the object of the investigation and that it is not planned to bring further charges against him on this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign had prepared a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 at the New York Times indicated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that was supposed to lead to Mr. Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasurer in the Ensign campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and support their opinions after Mr. Hampton was employed to lobby for them, so much documents and talks are in place.
Since Hampton was recently assistant to Mr Ensigna, he was excluded from the law from lobbying his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts claim that the unusual arrangement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were in the presence of friends, has emerged in opposition to the lobbying ban.
Of the evidence that was published "there has been a clear case of breaking the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are investigating the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decisions on Senator Ensigna, Mr Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the ministry was careful about political complaints, according to a large number of irregularities, including the decision last year to postpone the complaint against former Senator Ted Stevens in the face of the suspicion of State representation.
The federal prosecutors "had clearly concealed the weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Ciizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a group of lawyers who filed several complaints against Mr. Ensignov in this matter.
"It shows basically that the laws do not apply to highly established government officials," she added.
Paul Coggins, the chief lawyer of Mr Ensigna, announced in the interview that he was called on Monday by the State Department of Justice and then on the other day, and told him that the ministry had not sought any charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defence team cooperates with the plaintiff in trying to convince him that the senator, as his office repeated in the mid-term statement, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had submitted to the State's representatives.
"I am not pleased to count the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to suspend the investigation of the individual complaint, in which the ethical group alleged that the payment of Ensign Hamptons' parents in the amount of $96,000 violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbyist work was NV Energy, the leading NGO, which has been supporting the senator for a long time.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began acting as a lobbyist in the company, Mr. Ensign's employees - John Lopez - he communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had "boasted" into the Ministry in relation to the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another NGO client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after I hired Mr. Hampton at the lobby.
When Mr. Ensign first found out about the affair last year, he apologized to his wishes and confessed to his office as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After a months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the third election period in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer the aim of investigating the criminal act of his spokesman Jennifer Cooper, the senator has stated that he hopes that the ethical commission will follow the Ministry of Justice quickly and complete the investigation.
"Sentor Ensign is looking forward to continuing in his hard work on behalf of the Nevad people," she said.
Challenge of the county of Cheshire on Twitter
Half a dozen of them were written in a series of trials.
Just a minute later, they sent news about the terrible witness on Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter reports were about rapeing and bringing children to bed in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire citizens, Connecticut, family, and was scheduled to end the official execution of the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But the lawyers of Mr Hayes have already appealed to the court with applications and arguments that the court would probably have used for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the expanded use of Twitter's main reporters - created a "circuit atmosphere" and this extended, immediate disclosure of information with the inflatable details then introduced the jury in a decision in the sense of public opinion.
This claim might force the judge to consider whether new rules should also be required in the courtroom with the introduction of new technologies.
"As I have experienced this transformation, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the right of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief advocate of Mr Hayes.
The judge of the proceedings in Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the State briefly rejected the claim concerning the income from last week and the fact that the means of communication were "very controlled" and that there was no evidence to indicate that the jury was acting under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
After decades of trial, they recognized that notorically known cases could raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In the 1966 Supreme Court of the United States judgment, Dr. Sam Sheppard was dismissed for the murder of his wife when, in his decision, he said that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the "carnival atmosphere" was the subject of the proceedings.
Some people are convinced that this criminal act was an inspiring television show and a movie called "Apochlík".
Some lawmakers said that the appeals brought by Hayes' judgment about half a century later could be surprised by the argument that new rules might be necessary to determine how to communicate from a judicial perspective, which in the case of Dr. Sheppard was unrepresentable.
"There is a general reason for concerns about the impact of new media," said John J. Donohue III, professor of law Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was performed voluntarily.
Professor Donohue stated that some judges might be tempted to think that a restriction of immediate communication in the direction of justice could make the trial more just.
The case of Twitter is only one of many shadowed lawyers, Mr Hayes, who would be able to argue for years to refrain from executing the judgment.
For example, the defendant also claims that in Mr Hayes' case, it may be a pretense when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential jurors by showing them criminal pictures of the threat in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jury stated that they were terrified by the photos of the victims that Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The defendants claim that they also reject the statute of death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed the jury, which was critical of the state representatives, and that by his decision he wrongly imposed a greater pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jury wasn't separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They argued against the verdict brought last month that the case was dominated by reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign against the governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the means of communication were constantly blowing the flames of emotion in this case.
"Today's press, camera, and reporters were before the court," the lawyer wrote, "there was something that has not yet been seen in New Haven, and it may also be a state-of-the-art rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the discussions, some reporters claimed that the immediate reporting was more disturbing than the reports later mentioned, and from their point of view the judicial police should control the scope of the other proceedings.
But some lawyers have demanded that courts withdraw with often used arguments that social and technological changes require the adaptation of the courts.
Mr Hayes' lawyers are working on this right.
In their archives they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in the case of Dr. Sheppard, on account of the broad application of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell in the 21st century."
Can the court prevail?
After the campaign, which was remarkable for its hostility and negativity, a small number of atrocities emerged this week in Washington.
Is it the first owner of real cooperation between the two political parties or just the illusion moment before a quick return to the side fighting in the capital?
The internal talks of President Obama and the parliamentary leaders did not bring up any key findings on the key topics to be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, there was a heated discussion on the differences of views between the two parties, as well as the definition of their common responsibilities, rather than the next empty episode of the side-carrying.
The Central Public Meeting of the President's Deficit Commission was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close association has been building mutual respect for several months, which exceeds the ideological gap that members still share.
And it's pretty hard to say she started a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in the trial period - they are investigating each other's signs of collegiality and compromise, trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the willingness to endure the renewed foreign war.
Therefore, the Tuesday hearing and its subsequent evaluation of the participant were also conducted with minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republics are too wide and too deep to propose a rapid change in the conditions that have been in place for the last two years.
Whether it's a question of taxes, expenditure, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections prepared Washington at least quickly.
"There is no question whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after election.
The election exudes the emotions of the parties and then you're silent.
It's good."
In a number of questions, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and democratics have a small chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax reduction at the end of the year has been exhausted, and no one thinks it's a favor.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, which is either permanent or temporary.
Like a possible compromise on unemployment rates only because Republicans cannot look at how they support the reduction of taxes on the property while the unemployed refuse unemployment support.
After Tuesday's discussion in the White House it is already possible to see greater optimism about the possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of the new start-up treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institute points out that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship between the two political parties when the 112th Congress calls for ice.
It's more likely a period of disagreement or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing the things that have to be done, psychology will soon return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is considerably expanded - that the diocese will lead them to genuine cooperation.
"I look at all events between the present and the year 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the formation of a new republican majority in the White House and the election of tea parties that helped create it.
Republican leaders are now facing the danger of aggravation, they know that they must act in accordance with their promises and that they must reduce government spending and abolish the new health legislation.
These guidelines are clear in the initial reactions to recommendations on the deficit, which include reform of the taxable person and the increase of certain taxes, increase of the age of retirement and the reduction of expenditure.
The joint presidents Alan Simpson and Erskin Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their opinion, have to develop the pressure on the deficit issues to the public programme in ways that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes in the 18th Committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and therefore fight to get as close as possible to this issue.
The biggest resistance is among the elected jurors who propose that we have, at least today, a small basis or a will for compromise in the case of financial matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary republics.
The first year will begin in the form of bilateral conflicts, when Republicans call on Obama to resolve the budget, the tax and health care, when the period will be followed by greater bilateral cooperation.
What's going on with the motion?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that despite the last election site, most Americans still want to see two sides working together.
If it could be addressed to the pat, as it was in 1995, both parties will be very closely monitoring the public’s reactions.
Anyone who is threatened by a reduction of votes will probably change the course and look for a compromise.
That could be an optimistic view of the thing.
Sidelineness and orientation are greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it is shown that there has been a greater ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary republics than in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prerequisite for more important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, the diocese that appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common foundations on issues that still divide them.
The U.S. paper counts Moscow as a shelter for corruption
The city is in the hands of "kleptocracy" and this continues part of the payments and protection payments coming to Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia took place in February's records.
The police and the Federal Security Service have a large number of protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal transactions but also from organised criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "the vertical office" - will take his own when the money starts to shift upwards.
The record, which was sent to Washington on behalf of Ambassador John Beyle, was published on Wednesday through WikiLeaks on their websites.
The record is based on the sources whose name was written.
The record was written at the time when he was still the mayor of Yuri Luzhkov and accused her of much corruption.
He was elected President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but since then we have only been able to observe minimal changes in the clean.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelen Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, for many years have constantly denied the charges of corruption, and won several charges for guilty charges for such complaints.
In September, he said to the Russian TV station when he was questioned about proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's bullshit."
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will show itself to vote.
It is, however, unusual to meet with such details in such a way as to be calculated in the ambassadorial report, and it is also unusual for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
"The government of Moscow and its connection with criminal lives have led some to call it 'disfunctional,' and confirm that the government functions more as a leptocracy than as a government," the report says.
"Criminal elements are enjoyed by the so-called 'krisha' (a term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'crush' or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the State Representative, as well as everywhere in Moscow's government bureaucracy.
"Analytics identified a three-way structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is on his own top."
"Federal Security Service, Ministry of the Interior and militias are at second level."
"And finally, at the lowest level, they're ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty spaces in some areas, since the city does not provide some services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, "Business owners in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (better than organized criminal groups), as they do not only have more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the course."
The record says that while the choice of money is complex, protection alone can already have problems; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who don't pay fast enough will close their shops under different locks.
The bear talked about fighting corruption several times, but admitted he only made little progress.
The Embassy report speaks of men taking bags, probably heated cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview with George Satarov, director of the Moscow Research Team India.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"There is no part of the political class, because there are no more political classes in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that there are more than $300 billion in Russia worldwide every year.
The country is ranked 154th in a recent survey of the global perception of corruption by the NGO of Transparency International (the country is ranked from at least the most corrupt).
The discovery of the US Embassy's report, which appeared in Moscow until late evening hours, certainly did not provoke the Russian government's enthusiasm, although only to the extent that the Moscow deficit can be blamed for Luzhkov, it may be an opportunity for Kremlin to argue on the issue of solving the problem.
During a discussion with CNN with Larry King, Putin said that the documents that WikiLeaks published could have been falsified and responded in anger to a statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The whole issue is that it is about our mutual solidarity, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so inethically."
The Red Khmer veterans are forced to deal with the past
In the low-lighted concrete school, the head of the Anlong Veng High School recalled the man who built it, the leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves the Mok."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sarg Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "stork" for its rawness during the Rudh Khmer government, the commander of this remote country of the Rudh Khmer in northwestern Cambodia remains popular, where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmer government gave up, the long-lasting loyalty is also in Anlong Veng.
In April, the victims of the forum of truth and reconciliation were allowed to meet with people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that first explain the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers to the children.
And in July the United Nations and the Cambodian Court will bring together the first sentence of the former Red Khmer member, the ruling of a former leader, notorically known violent association Tuol Slang, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With all such progress, the tension between the Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng grew, which complicates efforts to calm down and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"One of the former Red Khmers is anger and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"The life among the Red Khmer was wonderful for them, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It's family-making."
During the government of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, according to estimates, 1.7 million people were either corrected or died of hunger, disease or reprocessing.
When the Vietnamese attacked and challenged the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they started a resurrection that lasted until the last move in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led partisan wars from their bases in mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated staupence in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement, sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to move to the government, which led to the capitalisation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who survived, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby mountains of Dangreek.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while waiting for trial.
Their mercenaries were no longer concerned with them, most of the former Red Khmer fighters fell into the ordinary Cambodian rural life and many of them nostalgically recalled the time of movement.
Although several elite Red Khmers held their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefits from the capitalization," said Sok Lang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which leads a public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raising without any idea of making a deal."
Sir Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmer was good," he said.
"That Mock enjoyed all."
"But now life is hard, because we have to make sure of ourselves."
The running court of the Red Khmers has also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sarah and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Khmers.
The court has a mandate to sue the head of the detainees and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said that it will continue in four cases.
It was just a little to calm down the anxiety in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was the district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Rudi Khmer government at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she was looking at the structure of Trapeang Thma, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
Last night Im Chaem returned from field work to his wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to rise and the shadows appeared over the empty grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past among the Red Khmers.
If the court had called her, she would have refused to leave.
"In Cambodia there is peace and stability," she said.
"If there's another criminal prosecution coming up, there's a war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who passed through the Red Khmer in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court would look for other suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"The Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury in it the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, Chhang Youk from the documentation center said.
"A calming in the Khmer environment means the blinding of broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to give these broken pieces together so that we can understand."
The Centre has issued the first textbooks approved by the Government of the Red Khmer, has 75 pages and the name "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the history of the Ministry of Education, which contains fewer than four parties on the Red Khmer.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew only a few details about the Red Khmer, even through the connection of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, high school student at Anlong Veng said that the new textbook helps students understand the important parts of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he took his book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious, because they're not sure how many people will get a trial."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and more difficult, said Sok Lang.
But the public forum, the textbooks and the court are beginning to have an influence, he went on to tell us.
The Red Khmers here still have a strong magic.
Up in the mountains of Dangreek Mountains is the path of a muddy and smoldering plastic bag, which leads to the edge of the black mat, covered with a sophisticated back cover.
Paul Pota's body was burned here on a bunch of tires after his death in 1998.
Noum Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman on the side of the road said he didn't know much about the man who was burned at the site.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Noum Sothea had a birthday and was planning to visit the place of Pol Pota's rest, where she would bring a link of mature bananas in the hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees that it appears its weapons stock on the basis of uranium
In a surprising victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material all over the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they are surrendering their resources to highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint declaration issued after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Hillary Rodham Clinton and by the Belarusian Minister by Serge Martynov.
After years, the American government tried to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and it seemed that the last spring had been hit by a rock of interest.
But U.S. officials said The Washington Post, in the last two months, a couple of undercover operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons based on uranium from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for the mid-term agreement to remove the remaining material - about 500 pounds, according to the official who spoke under the terms of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Safety Summit in April, on which Belarus was expelled.
And it was apparently a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Partnership for Global Security, a group supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a major, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would provide all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide for up to four years.
Since then, the American government has helped six countries rid themselves of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
That's how a dozen countries did it for George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obama's nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never surrender to its uranium.
"We have a highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically the basis for weapons and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our compost... we don't intend to make dirty bombs and we don't intend to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, joined the United States several months ago and expressed interest in reaching the agreement.
The first obligation to remove the Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily sealed, the officials announced.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian storage and disposal facility, the officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and the aircraft was carried out, the officials said.
The US government has lost $13 million for the programme, most of which to hand over to the Belarusian research institution less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything has been coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust," said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for the study on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for the manufacture of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration, endeavour to remove its resources by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained over the years, especially because of the harsh repression of human rights in Lukashenko.
But the medium-term declaration indicates the possibility of a gradual decline.
"We welcome the progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that the further respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving the relationship between the country and its inhabitants," he said.
The Spanish government didn't work with the CIA's years of dragons.
The Spanish government has not made any strides regarding the CIA's flight of the Taliban prisoners and the members of Al-Qaida to Guantanam over the Spanish territory, as the United States envoy in Madrid said in his telegram.
It follows from the documents provided by the server Wikileaks of El País, where it is also written that then Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vegová asked to be informed by the Spanish executive and "could thus show that he has appropriate oversight of foreign aircraft flying Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe, in which tens of thousands of States, including Spain, were accused of collaborating in human rights violations, a meeting took place between the US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The representative of the Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe's "declared Zapater's government from the game" and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain does not have a problem with the years of secret services across its territory.
"But they just want to be informed," so they don't get "unprepared," Aguirre says in one of the documents.
The then Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel Moratinos pointed out to the American ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter as low as possible, but because it was in the hands of judges, the cabinet had limited influence".
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González informed Velvyslanectv that, as far as he is concerned, it was not intended to block the initiative of the judge to request the withdrawal of documents from the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence relating to CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated material or sensitive information," Velvyslanectvja explained after the hearing with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concerns rather about "the clear coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than about the withdrawal of information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, at the occasion of the U.S. Embassy lunch and Minister of Interior Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, the ambassador said that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what they will consider appropriate", he already instructed his collaborators, "to avoid varied comments with a view to reducing tension".
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the political party Party Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - p. 1) in this regard.
"Even with its general proameric orientation, our experience tells us that the Party Popular will not hesitate to use any hints that Zapater's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the US negotiations that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if this revelation could have negative consequences for the United States government," he notes.
Admitting mother-killer complained on the network on the mother's "old age"
A young woman talked about a child when she was dead, and she had her blog, "Teror after Galician."
Monica Juanatey Fernández says "Muki" on the Internet.
with this nickname she used at a distance, she communicated with her sister and at least one friend; both are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruña, where a young woman comes from.
The reports have been published since 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman’s emotional life, which the journal ABC reconstructs with the testimony of her family members.
A three-year-old woman from Galicia entered in 1998 in relation to industrialist Ivan Tunez.
We've been together for a year.
Soon after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
A man wanted to know if he was his newborn baby, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
You recently found a new knowledge.
Her chosen was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousam.
Their compositions have lasted for a long time.
Little César lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the boy stayed with her partner, who even invited her to visit Palma for a week.
However, from the content of her communication it is clear that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, he's alone at Menorce, and he says, "Alberto's kind of angry that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes he's got to be with a little girl all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she's talking about the text message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I'm going to send you a child."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving a little girl with my mother, I'll take him when I get back," he says.
in May, he talks about his return to his place: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'm only going to 19 because I have to go to work so I don't get to the place."
He explains that if everything goes well, he'll take his son to himself.
"He will be with whom he is to be with, then with me, and he will never again in his life that I would leave him with someone other than my mother," a questionable intention in view of her bad relationship.
There's another contribution here in July.
When this report is released, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island of the first day of this month and was probably murdered 10 is already dead.
"César is satisfied on one side, but not on the other."
"He's on one side with me, and he likes it here, but on the other side he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to summer school, and I'm going to save some money for the herd."
Seventeenth regards and complaints.
"A big mouth from César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says I don't know what kind of video to email you, look how he wants to meet me, the sex needs."
Thirty-second report: "The boy is doing well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one report about Victor, the current partner: "He's giving me money."
On the Internet, Monica's contributions are on the blogs dedicated to anime and minors.
She even had her own at MySpace, now revised, where she let her call "Muki ex-prisoner."
"Teror after Galician (motto)".
The last man with whom she lived, the guard, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
He doesn't want to believe everything would happen because she didn't tell him he was a free mother.
Monica entered the Provincial Ministry last night in Palma, where she came from the city center of Menorce.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, pointed out that the defendant did not remember how it all happened and "that she had no intention of harming the little one."
Before, however, she admitted that she drowned César in the bath and put his body in the trunk.
The defence and the prosecutor are requesting a psychiatric examination.
The people would get 4 chairs and PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia - late November) to lose 9 mandates
With the results of November 28, the PP party could have the main word on the councillors in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in the votes received and the number of experienced Members during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Catalan Lidová party - conzkl.) already has an idea of the general elections, whether or not they have been raised, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in the international elections is usually one such contrast to the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in general, while in the 2006 elections, this number was only 316.2222.
Last week she received a PPC (Catalan Lid page) 384,091 votes.
If this trend of navigation was maintained, which was supported by the transfer of PSC votes and the loyalty of PP voters, the analysts calculated that if the general elections were to take place, the PPC could obtain 12 Members in the House against the current 8th side of CiU (Convergence and the Union, the Czech Shoda and the Union - at the latest) to also obtain 4 mandates (they are 10) and PSC would lose at least 9 chairs (they are 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia has a key role to play for the parties to the PP and PSOE (Spain's Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the people, the party of the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia - Mayo) would lose one MP - now has 3 - while the ICV (Mayo Green Initiative for Catalonia) would continue to have one mandate, possibly another.
However, according to the election calendar, the nearest delivery will take place in May 2011 at the opportunity of the general elections, where people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the Socialist rule in the four main provincial cities and also on the changes to the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest budget - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Nationalists, as well as the people, agree with the possibility that PSC could lose the councillors in Barcelona, Tarragon, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists did not receive the majority and could not turn to their traditional allies, the parties of the ERC and the ICV.
As a result of the Republican debate, it would not be possible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona representative - as it is necessary to obtain at least 5% of the votes.
The PP site has increased the number of votes received in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the operation in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party before the present mayor, Josepe Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP received only 500 votes more than PSC, whose Mayor Angel Ross has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The people also received other important councillors, such as Badalona, Castelldeels, or Reus.
At the present time, the PP is represented at 34 councillors in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell provided the Al-Qaida organization with thousands of bands
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistani and one Nigerian detainees of the General Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadic cell controlled by Thailand, which established travel passports to various groups of Al-Qaida, among which were also "Tygres of the Liberation of Tamil Ilam" or "Lashkar-e-Thaiba", while the second group named was the author of the assassinations in Bombay, where 106 people were killed in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to ensure through "operation Kampai" the weakening of Al-Qaida's submarine at international level and "restricting its operational capabilities".
Researchers estimate that during the two years that this cell was active in Catalonia, it could send thousands of travel passports to Thailand, where it was then handed over to groups that form the criminal galaxy of the Al-Qaida organization, so that their "warners" could travel fearlessly across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This fragmented cell was not the only active one that had a grid of jihad in Europe, and therefore these investigations, apart from Thai services, also participated in other European police units, and it cannot therefore be ruled out that in the following days, there will be no similar attacks in other European countries, such as last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begu, Tanveer Arshad and Nigeriac Babatounde Agunbiade) further developed in Thailand, where the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikinlaya Kybumrung were captured.
It was these men who drove the cell from Bangkok living in Spain and elsewhere in other European countries.
The Catalan network, the part of which was abolished in 2009, in particular stole tourist passports that met Islamic requirements.
This means that the documents had to belong to men aged 25 to 45 years, had to be valid for several years, and had to be without marked visas.
The investigation documents emphasise that no evidence is yet known to link the arrests of Catalonia with the assassination in Bombay, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should have been one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be noted that a few days before this assassination, approximately $1,000 was sent from the Catalan Transfer Agency, which was "introduced" to purchase tickets to mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command", who killed 106 people.
The police have already had a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) requires Mass to stop the fiscal agreement
The president of the PPC (Lid Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchezý-Camachová had the opportunity to present his own terms to Arthur Mass yesterday, for which he was willing to support his introduction to the role of President Generalitat; these terms are consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and to reject ventures such as an economic agreement which the leader of the nationalists wishes to propose during his mandate.
The president of the Catalan peoples went to the meeting with Arthur Mass with the certainty of the 18 Members' chairs received in the elections last week, which is more than satisfactory for obtaining the form, and therefore the CIU candidate needs to hold a vote on his arrival to the office at least one of the formations of the opposition.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists in Snowwater would like to maintain when general elections are held, but the talks that lead to the remaining political leaders in these days of Mas are carried out by the Catalan spirit.
With regard to President PP, in order to get her support for the introduction of the function, "it will have to end with all the official and free speech", as well as with the economic agreement - similar to that of Basicka - which the CiU leader even wanted to put to the vote in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to narrow down the obsolete political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce the legacy and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Mass's introduction to the function will take place under PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a strong opposition, Joan Herrero (ICV) and today he meets with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Riverou (Ciutadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidaritat Catalana).
The manager of the geriatric device ensures that death has not occurred as a result of "a lack of measures"
The presentation of the center of Olot does not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the Geriatric Centre La Caritat de Olt (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday to explain the damage caused by the criminal behavior institution Joan Vily Dilmé, a caregiver who, in the meantime, had been employed, killed at least eleven seniors who were in charge.
The head of this house for Seniors Joan Sala has been escorted by a lawyer, lawyer Joan Canada, and announced that "the desire of the house La Caritat would be able to bring charges against the guilty" to the responsible murder, however "the law and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the good name that can be suffered by this institution because it has not, in time, discovered criminal activities of the caregiver, the great threat to the home of La Caritat now poses requirements for material compensation that are already calculated by the legal representatives of the remaining families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime occurred in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since now
The judge ordered exhumation of eight clients' bodies of seniors with suspicion that in many cases no doctor had visited the deceased personally, but, given the age and poor health of the patients, everything had gone off the phone.
La Caritat yesterday, through her director, resolutely rejected this rigour and stressed that "the lack of measures could in no way be the cause of what happened".
The legal representative of La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party would be in doubt, except for its own defendant".
The man now named "The Angel of Death" admitted yesterday 11 deaths and explained that the first crime was allowed on 29 August 2009 and that he killed the second senior in the month and half later.
in this case, death caused by too high insulin doses, unlike the first time he used a combination of soothing tablets.
The Director of La Caritat stated that it is complicated to control staff access to medicines.
Insulin and sedative were likely in six cases with nine means that this caregiver used to kill patients in an effort to relieve them from suffering.
However, the analysis that is currently being carried out in the laboratory should show whether Vila is nearer and really looking for less cruel death for her first victim or, on the contrary, he killed her by giving the lie, as he already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat, they do not believe in a medical claim, nor do they rule out that the number of people killed may be higher than what they have admitted, and justify their conduct in the various versions that Vila has given to the court, knowing that he must change his behavior when it turns out that he killed eight people.
That is why they say that they want justice to be available to clarify the whole scope of this matter.
The European Central Bank is in danger
The investors responded to yesterday's threat by President Trichet's European Central Bank, who pointed out that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
Coastal differentials closed by force and the European Bank's shares dropped by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to err - the euro has just risen above the critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the non-liquid market, which, although it is declining, recovers - but thanks to a short and very speculative position.
The investor will take some time before he loses his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank was urging us to return to liquidity, and tomorrow we will have to withdraw in two years.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the State debt recovery plan for the inefficiency and elimination of all exceptional liquidity levels within a period of one week and for unlimited access only for a period of one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity level to be predicted "minimumly by March" and to comply with a three-month bid with an unlimited approach to the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue in their bond purchase programme and that they will even announce its increase.
If it does not meet the expected expectations, it creates a re-reaction of markets from yesterday, and even if they continue to be blind to the level of liquidity, Allah is with us!
It was the same at the convention in May, where they claimed that they did not even consider buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets - tomorrow the story could be repeated.
The European Central Bank must be reliable and durable.
In May, she announced that she had bought a lot of them on Monday and on Wednesday, which led to another collapse of the market.
Yesterday's auction for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro spent only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting a change in the mood on the market to which Trichet's words came.
In Ireland, the figures represent the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent approximately 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, until February they have a chance to stand with private capital, otherwise they will be settled.
Although Ireland has no credibility after the problem has not been revealed by stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable within the framework of the aid plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on the next Tuesday, the government will need to get Parliament's approval of the new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so there is still government uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has calmed down her speech to release the tension in the face for the next EU summit on 14 December, which requires a political compromise to show that we are the Union and we are all on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the others would prefer Beethoven Oda to be happy.
In Spain last night, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, reduction of deficits, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to restore employment - to investors' ears it sounds like four years from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock exchange grew by 4.5%, i.e. twice as much as the other European stock exchange.
Unlike February, the government's reaction and the Spanish National Banks were quick and convincing - we want to see the effect of surprise.
Today we have a key bid for three years, which will benefit from Trichet's effect, which, we hope, will be a big demand for it, which will help to resolve our doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Requesting a rescue plan would be for Spain's suicide.
They would give us the cash we don't need - in El Tesoro there are 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - high rates and market access would close our son-in-law.
However, we still need to use Cesar's wife's strategy - "not to be the same, but to be the same".
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen Group will attack the talks of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
In the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, are inconvenient.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack after being considered "very insignificant", the legal proceedings of El Enebro scheduled for the 16th of this month and required five of his seven descendants, to try to excite most of them and to strengthen themselves with the administrative authorities of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia prosecution.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José settle the legal group for their new chapter of their dispute over the governance of the part of society.
The founder of the largest holding of business services does not appear to be willing to settle in his dispute about membership in the ruling authorities of the El Enebro group.
of its administrative committee, five of its seven descendants, who were appointed to the meetings of shareholders on 18 January of this year and whose objection is entered in the Trade Register.
The trial of the El Enebro group, scheduled for the sixteenth of this month, which was sent to the Trade Court's official No. 2 in Madrid, renewed the quarries in the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge shall be the only legal remedy to resolve the dispute, which guarantees the Commission's call.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elviry of the Alvarez Mezquirizov is to consider David Alvarez as "the desperate means of his five children serving with the help of the judiciary and a clear legal subjugation to strengthen and improve the 18th January, which has been totally ineffective".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal attack of this act as "very insignificant".
The sole protagonists who discreetly silenced themselves have already tried without success to call the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned by other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls the seven descendants of David Álvarez 100% capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires the right to use 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when dealing with the question of a judicial attack. The date of the transfer has not yet been determined.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapons from Siemens
Software proposes improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed is characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the opportunity of this new incoming team too seriously, and despite the recent upward trend, all agreed to the Ferrari Fernanda Alons triumph.
Without wanting to reduce the rider's ability to champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, in Formula 1 world, has been born a legend - "secret weapon", which the multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is an effective software simulating revenue which the German company introduced on the market in 2007 for the purposes of very remote car sports.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software tool, was used to design assembly lines in manufacturing races around the world, in energy races and for high precision devices.
Its purpose is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, which can avoid unnecessary errors and spending.
PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon camera, the Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most popular commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this software enabled the Red Bull team to carry out "in a few hours, in almost real time" modifications and improvements, which otherwise occur during the race and test.
Russwurm says that in 1992 there were an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements during one period.
in the Red Bull team today works on 180 highly qualified professionals equipped with efficient information technology who analyse and propose any type of vehicle modification.
The leader of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull racing vehicles with the exception of the engine that Renault fully responds to.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are modified.
Changes can be made from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours due to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical capacity is the amount of 40 million dollars representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up about 50 km from London's peak technology race to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings that have limited access to visitors - especially to journalists.
All that's happening here is considered a "great secret."
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero Red Bull is in Formula 1 with no doubt a fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, for the immeasurable technological means that the label of energy drinks has put into its participation in the race circles, other protagonists, whose aid is invaluable, are hidden, and nobody knows it.
Chief of Production Technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in the research and development of vehicles contributed to a 50% victory and the rest was a driver's merit.
At present, this ratio has changed and technology stands at 85%, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, as they are "unforeseen gladiators".
HP will set up its own business in two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP), in collaboration with his trading partner Pont Reyes, celebrated its first exclusive sale in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first of a network of 20 shops ranging from 80 to 100 m2 which this supranational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing trading houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte English.
Spanish Vice-President HP Helena Herrer pointed out as an example of a newly built sale to Barcelona's Gran Vía, a company of Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has come up with a plan to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2013, including 20 Spanish shops.
The first sales were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the trade in Barcelona is the third.
Herrera did not want to explain where further sales would be opened, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrera, who also runs HP's personal systems, has ensured that the philosophy of opening up trades will still be the same - with the use of local distributors who have the expertise and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises on the exclusive design of sales equipment (with products that can be tried interactively) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also involved in providing personnel for trade.
Helena Herrer said it would be franking, and stressed that the exclusive network sold aims to "improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises in purchasing, service, family service and even packaging".
Trade in Barcelona is part of the world-wide pilot programme that aims to solve any problems with computer devices in the guarantee.
Online service is connected to the technical centre of Maastricht (Netherlands).
"Then we'll be able to solve problems within 10 minutes, which otherwise may last up to two days."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have a contract service for technical assistance," said Helen Herrerová yesterday.
Sabadell agrees that he will steal over three years to his competitors a million customers
More optimistic than other bosses, a member of Banco Sabadell's Board of Bank, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a demanding year for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
However, it is calculated by reducing interest rates, but it will try to compensate by matching bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to be able to obtain a million private customers within three years.
Sabadell has found a way to use the next three years and can survive under difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan with validity for three years in 2011.
The aim, in addition to survival without having to turn to public assistance in the FROB, is to gain market share by attracting millions of new private customers - 700,000, respectively, if those who leave the bank, if any - since up to now and the institution has been moving small and medium-sized businesses and large businesses than small customers.
This year, 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies have already been granted a bank.
Its market share is 3.5% for private customers, while in corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or can also be said to be bridging, in order to reduce the costs that the Bank will face when presenting the results for the period.
A lot of banking institutions at this time dare to set their goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the world banking industry.
Sabadell this year will close his Optima programme, set four years ago, although originally for three years, but the situation on the market required expansion for another period.
Customers who leave the fire department will be their main target group.
At the meeting of scheduled APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "hard and very important".
It is believed that the road from the crisis in Spain will be "long-term".
In addition, in two or three years, it will be "very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector.
And although they believe that the passive war - which reduces the margins - is decreasing, the price of the risks that banks and counterparties pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, which compensates for the reduction of the margins.
"The theme of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a stress factor for loans."
"We haven't closed the shell yet, but the differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and higher differential prices - see CincoDías, November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "now is a reduction of commissions", but here is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell's strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It is not for free to ensure that in Spain "greater sizes will be required".
"Next year there won't be a stone left," he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are "very reduced" and does not rule out that some Spanish institutions enter among the red numbers.
And it shows that FROB can market the collection of funds before new capital measures.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it is still a serious problem what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It means that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to obtain short-term funding through repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA excludes another flux of spores
Yesterday, the Director-General of CECA refused that another wave of fusion should be triggered and continued at the speed with which the reorganisation of the sector is being carried out.
When he was starting the process of association of Spanish partners, there were several institutions that ensured that this first phase was not involved and waited for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation spousal (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta ruled yesterday that a new wave of these operations should occur.
"I believe that most mergers have already been implemented, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Civic group cannot be regarded as a second round, what happens are contracts."
"Most are fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already ready and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has worked very well on this issue," the director noted.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA (Association of Leaders and Executive Officials of Aragon - see above) Olavarrieta concluded that the concentration process is being carried out "as quickly as possible and we must be very satisfied, as shown by the payments made in its time, not now, in business plans, with the Spanish National Bank", he stressed.
"From 45 partners with average assets of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, thus reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be larger and thus fall in accordance with the Basel Treaty," he said.
Olavarrieta admitted that "there are a number of unfortunate views on the slowness of the process", which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding", because "what the Spanish National Bank does is to remind us that we must be in time before the end of the year".
CECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta made sure yesterday that Spain had the strongest financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world, and that those who doubt it had attributed "a lack of knowledge".
The Director noted that, in the current favourable economic situation, we can "be calm" about financial institutions and the system which has managed the "very important" concentration process and which continues "as fast as possible".
He also recalled that Spanish banking was very good from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Stocks and red German lines
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but laid down conditions for the Union as a whole.
The tension on the markets caused two government responses.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero has proposed a new adaptation measure, from the reduction of taxes on small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private brokers or the cancellation of 426 euros for unemployed without a fee, until 49% AENA (Spain airport and air traffic management – no later), the manager of Barajas and El Prat airport and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, Vice-President Elena Salgadová joined criticism of the office of Angely Merkel for her responsibility for the resolution of the current crisis.
How to interpret this movement?
It is said above that Merkel's opinion is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is going to be, which affects the idea of respecting the old traditions that are held by a large part of the other members.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible routes from the crisis.
The first is a strong euro area, part of which would be Germany, but also for example Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the return to March - although it can now appear as a scifi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to Germany's proposals, is to recast the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary incentives, fines for criminal states, possible delays in payments for some of them, and by extending the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no space for the exits now.
First, when in 2009 the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission caused deficits, the German government withdrew its constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a dispute between what Germany considered to be right (tax incentives and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second showed this Central European country when Merkel painfully reached a decision on Greece's salvation.
It has already been the subject of sharp criticism, but it is true that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which has also been published, were strongly against the salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last few October days, Merkel has again found herself with a clear opinion when she called for a reform of the European Union's conventions so that it would be possible to save a Member State and, at the same time, for private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European because it has accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although somewhat reduced, has been approved, and we should monitor the reform process of the Union in the coming months, which should enable these measures to take place since 2013.
The Germans came across a red line that they won't cross.
And he tells us all that although it is now necessary to take measures which are apparently too inconsistent, the old functioning of the euro will end from this date.
The year 2013 will be the birth of a new monetary zone, in which the violating states will be severely penalised and may be forced to report a deferral of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany suggests that we need to make a strong path to growth by increasing the rate of savings and investments, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on demand and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, which governments in the years of boom growth in Spain simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand it.
It is not only about restoring public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is much harder.
And the worst part is that under these conditions, we could be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulences will create greater peace.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that are given to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his two statements (reforms promised after meeting with large companies from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggest that, through criticism of Merkel's address, the way of thinking is to put things in order.
But the red line that Germany has drawn, it's here, and it doesn't seem to want to move with it.
And from the possibilities that can be considered, leaving the euro area cannot be ruled out completely by too many serious countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sports and rules
The Finns, led by Alonso and Ramos in the fight with Ajax, point to a lack of intention to avoid punishment.
It is believed that the decommissioning of two Real Madrid players (Xabi's Alons and Sergia Ramose) in the Battle of the League of Masters against Ajax on November 23rd caused the sea of ink to be written about whether or not this is non-sportable behavior and whether UEFA should possibly not punish both footballists.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which had their team clearly won) appointed players one after the other deliberately wasted time at a time when they had to play the fool to provoke the judge, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will complete the prescribed penalty in the next fight against Auxerre - and Real Madrid will end up in its group in the front - and will be able to move on to another stage.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary commission sentenced coach José Mourinh to two fights and the provincial players received a fine of money.
Making a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more common in football.
It's so extended that it's part of the ego football, so rules that are not written, but they follow.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that its participant was a team of Real Madrid (which in its humidly boasts of reverence and honor, and has already suffered for similar acts of its players), and as it seems, also thanks to the dramatization led by Maurinhem, which thus adds to its long history by the comedian and provocator of another episode.
in any case, the debate is concerned about whether this kind of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether in these circumstances there is a violation of the law; it is indeed about action which respects the rules of sport, which, however, seems to be trying to circumvent.
It is decided what kind of damage such a conversation can do to a sports spirit.
One aspect of sports behavior is the physical integrity of opponents who have not been disrupted in these cases, or have not been involved in a violent game.
Another of these features that characterize the clean game is to avoid the fact that players, due to their transgression, have an opponent's team of benefits - which has not been achieved here either.
So paradoxical in the action of the players of Real Madrid is that what we normally characterize as a hunting or law enforcement did not happen to a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behaviour should be as pragmatic as possible in order to obtain punishment.
They waited and loved to be punished.
The next question, however, is how the guilty will benefit from their deliberate transgression.
It is necessary to note here that the opponent does not reach an unfavourable position and that there is no benefit in the current match, as the obvious result is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for another match since the club won't be able to count with these players.
The benefits clearly lie in the fact that players will start the next phase of the League of Masters without cards that could threaten their participation in the future battle.
However, it is a benefit from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so the team can be eliminated at first sight, and in addition to this, the players will be rescinded to the second round of tickets, in which only one card will be excluded from the first round.
So as the car continues, it won't be quite clear if it's an advantage.
In short and well, these negotiations do not oppose the sport spirit, which is part of making a strategic decision that allows maximum benefit under the rules.
In the case we're dealing with here, the players had no intention of avoiding the award of punishment (which would be a clear case of compliance with the rules), but they chose rather when to do so.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or running away from the punishment.
Although there is no clear distinction between the type of argument and the scope of the rules, I believe that in this case it was clearly the type of argument.
It seems to me that controversy arises for two reasons: because it was about two self-exclusions and the way in which instructions were transmitted to them to provoke them from leadership.
The damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fighting offers for Christmas parties in Barcelona
The Dictate of the Calendar concentrates on the valve reservation this year on 16 and 17 December.
There is a fast-tracking celebration of self-employed people who want to lose between 20 and 30 euros.
As well as the Turkish honey or lottery, with the coming of December, pre-night parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, have ended up in a crisis in the fight to win customers by reducing prices: almost everyone wants to lose 20 to 30 euros for food, they agree with the demand of entrepreneurs and associations from this sector.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar this year (when Friday arrived on Friday) concentrated on requests for a week from 13 December, which resulted in a wave of reservations for days at the peak (16th and 17th), while there was almost no operation in the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the deaf years have begun, many companies have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
To avoid abandoning tradition, many employees pay for their own pocket party losses.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices on the fertility line, the president of the association restaurant Gremi de Resturacion de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of the restaurant facilities is not reluctant to predict what will be celebrated this month.
"People will think about it before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but as far as prices are concerned, they're careful," she says.
Trades will go well with those "who offer quality and good service at a favourable price", says and recalls that because of the crisis, customers tend to go down and most of the customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
The research in various facilities shows that the biggest demand for booking is on the evening of 17 December.
The Soteras Group announces a real boom of reservations this Friday, with the most requirements for losses of up to EUR 30, with an increase in the menu offered, the total prices of which range from EUR 25 to EUR 30.
In another significant company, Andilana, which includes 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought in more timely bookings since the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menu, from which everyone should choose, ranges from €19.95 to €30," they say.
In the AN Group including El Mussol, Attic, QuQ and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after they have seen the second half of the increase in profits and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas markets.
The resources of this company stress that it will also be a difficult day on 18 December as there will be a Christmas celebration between friends.
to their six group menus added the Christmas menu, with a budget of EUR 30 or more, as compared to last year, guests tend to lose 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish forest wine - late).
They also noted that companies are already appearing, which call their employees again, and it seems that the size of the groups is something bigger.
Fecasarm Vice President (which includes institutions such as Bar Association, Restaurant and Leisure Centre in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he starts to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of bookings is "resurrected", although customers "optimize".
This notion did not come true during the Christmas celebrations, whether it was paid or indicated by the payer.
Pakistan's nuclear program has caused a major unrest in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons "faster than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the United States embassy in Pakistan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published by the Wikileaks portal, confirms the extraordinary unrest that sparks the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
In addition to the explanatory and significant details that they offer regarding the content of communication and the idea of North American diplomats in Islam, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states, with regard to nuclear security, instead of increasing, "is on the move", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The speciality of the Pakistan nuclear programme - that its weapons are not disarmed, but conform to parts to facilitate their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main causes of Washington's despair.
This is calculated by the Embassy in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the present James Jones National Security Adviser: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and with the program of controlled shootings is not only observed in the United States, but also in Russia, as a growing and promising reason to be alert.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with strong religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or controlled shooting programmes," said the Russian Ministry expert Jurij Korolev abroad at a meeting with their opponents from the United States.
The latest documentation published by Julian Assange's server is further lower cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
Depeše issued by the Embassy in May, which qualified communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", claims: "Transparence often does not exist; aid offers remain unresponsible or are rejected".
in the next report, Peter Lavoy, a member of the National Intelligence Services for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world".
Velvyslannyna Petterson also asks Washington to "explain very well" during the visit of General Ashfânio's chief army, that "the Pakistani army must end up with the silent support of terrorist groups".
Hon to Chief Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high-ranking worker responsible for combating terrorism to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" to track and determine where Assange could be.
All about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange is a complicated maze where it's hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday a "extraordinary challenge", i.e. regular notice, to "localization and monitoring of the movement" of Assange.
However, it is not a classic order for detention.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but it dates to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last escape of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the charges of sexual abuse that Australia faces in Sweden.
In addition, the legal representative of manufacturer Wikileaks Mark Stephens assures the police that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assangem".
It was on November 20th, when the international police council, based in French Lyon, issued this order on a request from Sweden, did not publish it until yesterday, when he received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions for the identification or location of Assange "to establish a temporary link and issue it".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of persons who are concerned with the red call, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, consider the so-called regular notice to be a possible arrest - this must be ensured by the national police component - especially in cases where the Member States have a bilateral agreement on the issuance of detainees, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange should probably be found.
This step undermined Assenge's lawyers, who published the letters yesterday, stating that a nine-year-old founder, Wikileaks, was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities through videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compared with the legendary Lavrenti Paul Berij, chief of security.
"This is a hen and not a legal persecution," the letter says.
While the whole world is looking for her - and his mother from Australia blames her son - Assange is still in an unknown place, of course not silenced.
On Monday, he provided Skype with an unknown interview with the Chief Executive Officer of Time magazine - in this interview he requested a delegation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States of Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for the US diplomats' order to carry out espionage in the United Nations and violate such international conventions that the United States signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the White House press speaker Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for demise as "Laughter and absurd".
"I'm not absolutely sure why we should be concerned about the opinion of an individual operating the website," he told CNN.
Obama alone entrusted a highly established employee responsible for combating terrorism, Rusella Traverse, to prevent further document failures.
Speaker Barack Obama's intention to stop adding Assange to the importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who has been chairing the Committee on National Security since January in the Lower Chamber, asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks among the terrorist organisations "to be able to intervene and reach everyone who contributed financially or otherwise to help them".
Tom Flanagan, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's adviser, who announced that Assange should be "killed", which he subsequently had to withdraw.
"Both should write a reward or use an unmanned plane or something like that."
Whoever didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist priest, the former governor of Arkansas, and a possible candidate for the president.
"Whoever will be in the government, the person responsible for the failure of information, has allowed treason and any punishment other than correction would be too small," said Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for "swimming" in the ERC on the Carod tab
The Republican leader will allow the parties to vote in secret about his resignation.
Huguet proposes more plural execution and the end of the dating system.
Joan Puigcercos has apparently found a recipe to fight a number of internal revolutions in the ranks of the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia - late November), resulting in the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The president is aware that his gesture about demise seems to be insufficient to the followers of former leader Jose Luíse Caroda-Rovary, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weak as his own leader, and that he cannot absolutely care about other lost flows.
That is why Leader Levice will try to get new criticisms by means of marking, which will help him to turn to the general elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee would be able to speak in secret to his resignation.
I'm not raising my hands.
If the advocates of Carod wish to deliver a criminal vote to the President, they will be able to do so without fear of legal action.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the breakdown and details of his person.
in several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one additional, but added, without clarifying the percentage, that he would also not be a good result "in Bulgarian".
Carod's supporters demand more from the president than to make their function available - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, since Puigcercos has the highest authority at the meetings.
But given that they do not have enough to induce demise, they will try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
That is why they expect to participate in the preparation of a document on strategic reorientation, on which the national Council will vote on 18 days a month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercóse in exchange for the promise of moving the convention already in the autumn of 2011.
The leader of the ERC declared that "majority" is damaging stability, and that his aim is to enable the organisation to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, it seems to be a remarkable article that the current advisor, Joseph Huguet, signed on his blog.
After taking into account Puigcercós' ideology, this innovation advisor took the final point that the leader would be confirmed "for several purposes".
And he appointed five of them, two of them, to be overcome.
The first is the "recomposition" of the execution so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which also includes new faces that are from the Carod sector.
The second goal could be a big news item.
Huguet proposes that the ERC end up completely with expertise as a functioning mechanism.
And so he fights for state reform so that it is possible to hold congresses through the delegations elected by the vote.
The end of the model of the Conciliation System, the exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcercos team, which has already fought at two last meetings in this direction.
However, the 2008 Christian Assembly decided that the meeting should be considered at a special congress on state reform.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation within the party has reflected on the solution.
Now, without emerging critical sectors, it might be appropriate for a moment to deal with this matter again and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 in 2010
According to the MILENIO journal, Mexico had a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, about four less than in the previous month, as MILENIO reported.
Between the murders, there are three cases of women and a couple of separate bodies in Mexico City.
in the last month of the year, there are 390 murders in Mexico, probably linked to organised crime.
Between the cases, the finding of dead bodies in San Diego de los Padres Cuexconititlán, in the period Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, further a wound from grace to the head, and had hands and legs thrown in a rope.
The next day a body was found in the trunk, which was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle over the street of Mixtecas, in the Santa Cruz Acatlán colony, in the Naukalpan period.
Early in the morning, on Thursday 4 November, the co-operatives discovered the body of the unknown sign of torture and at least three deadly shots into the chest at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the section of the Villa Guerrero period.
Next to the body was a report signed by probably a criminal organisation of La Familia Michoacana.
About a day later, in Nezaalcoyotl, a 50-year-old man was shot by eight shots, after he left his home and wanted to start collecting waste.
On November 7, two victims were shot in the head at the age of 30 in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, in the period Ecatepec.
in Chalco was found on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo a man shot in the forehead, and underneath the body was found an armored weapon of calibre 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the waste water channel in the Playa Golondrin colony.
The rescue materials did a thorough search for other parts of it, but they did not find them.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlán reported the discovery of the body with their hands tied back and wrapped head in the place of Pena Colorado.
A man had a gun wound on his back.
In the mid-month, the murder of two men who were packed in the bedroom and left in the storage space of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda during the period Atizapán de Zaragoza also reported fatalities.
The day later was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the period Los Reyes La Paz carton, which contained the human head.
In the nearby colony, the body remains packed in a black plastic bag, reported by El Incorrigible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in the living room in Zoquiapan in the Ixtapaluca period, and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, a dead man was found wrapped in a yellow-modern desert, which was previously reported by the killers left at his body identified as Mario Ríos.
In Ixtapaluca there was a woman found in San Francisco Acuautla's stable without a mark of life with two wounds to the throat.
The female's skin was exposed to the tattoo of the sacred character of Santa Muerte (word "Holy Death" - later on) as well as its necklaces.
At the end of the month, a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the village of Zinacantepec in the car.
Two days later, two men were found who had their head wrapped with tape and found a report in the village of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In the victim's case, the report was probably written one of the criminal organizations in which it said, "This will happen to those who do not fit."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found, bearing signs of torture and had tied limbs, inside the abandoned taxi behind the Centre of Justice in the colony of San Agustín.
The last day of the month were the remains of two men in the Los Reyes La Paz and Nezaalcoyotl periods.
The first was found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was packed into black plastic bags, bound with tape and had a message with it; while the second was tired and found in the plastic packaging in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together with him, the agents found a note with the report.
China maintains its objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Change COP16 has ensured that its country has made an extraordinary effort to reduce carbon footprints and has made it clear that it is on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will fulfil its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% to 45% in 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Change.
In its first public speech at the 16th Conference of the Contracting Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei ensured that his country had developed an unscrupulous effort to reduce the carbon footprint and to transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million over the last four years in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
He noted, however, that China will not change its objectives and will continue to work with the international community on this matter.
He referred that the Chinese strategy on climate change was divided into four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these points, progress has already been noted, including the last approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed greenhouse gas reduction targets, explained.
He further stressed that in China the federal authorities cooperated in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their objectives in terms of energy savings, energy efficiency and emissions reductions.
Furthermore, as he said, various plans have already been completed, which are financed by both the Chinese Government and the governments of other countries.
For example, it is reported that the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the last five years, has received investments from the UN, the government and private initiatives.
The provincial project of climate change is also being carried out, further the project of exchange of fires for sustainable fires and the project of mitigation and adaptation has clarified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the expert adviser to this country for climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than they generally thought.
For example, he cured, greenhouse gas emissions per capita are 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share in emissions.
It has also developed unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased 20% energy efficiency over the last five years and expects further progress to be made by 2020.
Encouraging Espina: César Nava
The President of the PAN party (Partido Action Nacional, Czech National Action Party - No.) stated that the former President of the party is entitled to apply to the National Order Commission of its own law.
The President of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, has ensured that the exclusion of Manuel Espiny Barrientose has been legalized and that the former President of this party is authorized to address the National Order Commission and to demand his rights.
In the debate before the opposition by the Governor of the state of Gabin Cué Monteagum, he said that the exclusion of Espina is, in any case, a decision taken at the local level.
"It is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to address, in his case, the complaint to the National Council Order Commission in order to deal with the decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that it is now no time to think about 2012 and that it has never been at the negotiating table on the presidential candidacy of the Alliance.
Nava Vázquez has expressed his conviction that the PAN will come out of the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, has been strengthened.
"This (the alliance in 2012) is a theme that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, it was the intention for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The president of the PAN said that his side is 71 years of dialogue, and therefore he added that "we do not have internal competition, but rather we want it and strengthen it".
He said that the committee would be able to elect the best president or president for the next three years of the PAN, without debate, so it would send the staff to the "who the committee appoints".
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, any one of these five with pride, I will hand over to the Bureau of the Chairman of the Party."
He predicted that the accession, which the party recorded in the last elections in July, would be reflected in future plans, although "not yet time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabina Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, having roots in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, as "a lot of expectations and charges have been put into them, and I am sure Gabino is in line with these expectations".
When we asked her about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI party (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech Republic's Revolutionary Institutional Party, p. 1) because of his four-year speeches, which he ruled, César Nava called upon the PR members to think about the six-year periods of former presidents Ernest Zedilla and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
"If in PRI they think that the governments of Zedilla and Salinase were better than the government of Fox and Claderon, let them start defending them, let them get out of their streets," he confessed.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during the presentation in the National Auditorium, since there is no rubber or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes on Twitter the law to support students without documents
"If you think that the adoption of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and have to pass this law," the American president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama, with a contribution today to his personal social network account, has joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which should legalise students without documents.
"If you think that the adoption of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and have them approve of it," Obama tweeted.
His brief report points to an Internet link to a more comprehensive document that requires the public to connect immediately, as the vote on this law is approaching.
"Since it is expected that the vote will take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion sound," he says.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators were threatened by blocking the approval of any law unless the extension of the Bush era tax reduction and the financing of the government were approved.
Such a blocking notified by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the president said that he believed that once a fiscal topic was resolved, a calendar for the rest of the projects could be drawn up.
"I believe there's still a lot of time left..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we will be able to reach agreements on this matter and then we will be able to plan a series of other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would call for a "closed vote" on the Dream Act, so that the proposal for legalisation of students without evidence could be voted in the Senate from the next Thursday, although the most likely next week.
The Senate's approval of the Dream Act or the "American Dream" law would legalize about 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States 16 years before the end of the year, resided in the country for the last five years and were admitted to the institution of higher education or army.
However, the voter needs to approve a proposal of 60 votes, which is why several Republicans need assistance, so the organisation of its alternates is carrying out intense agitation to ensure the approval of this law.
The Democrats, whose majority of the Dream Act supports, have 58 mandates.
At least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of India, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, the members of the Dream Act need to obtain a number of Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators, with whom the senators most negotiate, are senators from Maine Olympia Snowwe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing senator from Florida George Lemieux, who has supplemented Senator Mel Martinez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they have declared that they will no longer support it in the future.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet expressed himself.
Although the representatives of Sniemovna join another version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature inserts the finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la la la la la la la la la laga", translated "put the finger into the wound" is the period of Czech "pull the skull - later).
The second round of the cycle The pleasure of the language was a change where participants presented the literary gala performance
"I understand this in the language, but... the finger to the wound? What do I expect from me?" asked writer Luis Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round Enjoyment of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used as a subtitle on this occasion (at another workshop at the cool table, the theme of Sex in the language was explained).
The finger to the wound "brings us to the narrows", the most popular Argentine writer brought to the audience, composed mostly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this debate at the cool table, moderated Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergia Ramírez, Mayry Monterov and Luis Garcia Monter.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text that she dedicated to Gonzal Celori, and which Schultz later marked for a great story, in which Luis appeared in the first person as a protagonist, who, when looking for the knowledge of what a "damage" is coming from a doctor to a doctor from which she does not get the answer, although the point of that story is yes.
From an infector, he goes on to say, "Persistence is not my strong side, it may be my wound."
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the morning is not a scientific term, it's a psychoanalytic that reveals the secret: "the morning is truly distraught and thus symbolic is scar".
The protagonist slowly rose up and concluded that "at the morning she was able to learn only so much that she is really confused and does not exist", but was convinced that the pleasure and punishment in the language must go hand in hand.
The writer of Valenzuel was playing with both of them.
Nikarageujec Sergio Ramírez also made a pleasant presentation, which he called the Praise of the Invention, in which he is not named in the morning, but at one point he will appear.
with the elements of magical realism, they tell about the famous wizard who played the clouds, brought back people who went far away, or fixed the honor that one lady lost, this report which then turned to speak America, a great novel in which his own chroniclers who told it were missing from the beginning, and here is quoted as Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticises the overcrowding in the execution of the Captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us all, laughed at the finged testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but otherwise never managed to tell the story of America with such imagery that even lost the stad."
However, he stressed, "it is crazy and liars who have greater imagination" and just where the reality and the lie, where they no longer know what the story belongs to one group and the other, reaches the fictional literature of their summit.
It's actually called the Cervant tradition.
"Thanks to his link, we have what we have."
As a result, Mayra Monter highlighted and praised the diversity of interpretations, which enabled the International Book Fair to be called with her words.
The Cuban-Portoric writer showed her finger on the big wound of social violence that passes through her country - and shares it with Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a quiet compromise that is of course not meant," she said after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and readers - and in their "chemical reaction".
In the evening, Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also stressed the "on this finger to the wound of the writer bound by the writer".
He said that in the world that lives in haste, as well as in intellectual growth and control of consciousness, which transcends dogmatism, it is forgotten that "there is a small one behind every attraction and there is also a small one behind every denial."
"To be gentlemen of our thoughts and realities we have to color: and coloring means many times putting a finger in the wound and bothering those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, blacks, fixed ideas and without coloring, and also bothering the authorities who prefer this black world," he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano follows his first title
Rubén Omar Romano is reading three defeats in the final, during his career he has experienced good and bad, but he has already been able to reach on three occasions on the decisive series.
In duele Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the finals, there are also two different styles that distinguish with their techniques, teams that have a marked difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano is reading three defeats in the final, during his career he has experienced good and bad, but he has managed to reach already on three occasions on the decisive series, but he has gone to the present time with the unarmed, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine must have been satisfied with the silver medal, remained a step after the victory and curiously played with the same team following the finals.
The Santist strategy as a coach came to his first final in the Apertura tournament in 2002, when he had a problem with the club Morelia, with a total of 4-2 against Toluce; then, in the 2003 Clausura tournament, he went back to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the Santos Laguna Club in Tournament Torneo Bicentenario 2010, against "the devils" from Toluka, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against "Uzenařům" (the next name of the Club Deportivo Toluca - late November) after 210 minutes of the game indiscriminately 2-2, after a series of criminal shootings he got to the advantage of three at one time and had two opportunities to secure a title, but at last his three players passed 11 steps and so suffered the turn 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against "Red Devils" from Toluca and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and so he could first celebrate the title, although he says he is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to get statistics, that's for the club, for the passion I'm bound to, and the title would be of course for me, but the first is the most important," said the coach, when asked about the number he talks at the finals against him.
in the living memory of his previous finals, in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, "we have been taught that until the end of the decision-making process, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as the players, because the past with two penalties, we have already been ready to go out to celebrate, and I think that we have learned in this, until the battle is over, we cannot celebrate".
He is not concerned that this series could be decided in criminal killings, he believes his players: "You never try to come to a series of criminal heaps, you try to end in normal time, but sometimes there is no other possibility and it is necessary to be prepared for this, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately, but fate has caught the bad strain, perhaps because of the nerves or difficulties we felt when the title was in our hands, but we have lost it, it has left us in and we hope that this time will not happen to something like this."
Romano has a chance to stop being the second one and to taste the first glory that titles bring.
The United States shall amend the rules for the provision of visas
People will have to turn to the Visa Request Service centre even before the Consular Department is called; costs will be lower and the waiting period will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the visa negotiation process will change to the United States and consulates Velvyslanekt.
with a new procedure, most applicants will have to turn to the Visa Applicant Services Centre (as soon as ASC) before the Consular Division is consulted.
The ASC staff shall receive biometric information from the applicant and they shall be assessed by the consular department before the consultation.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of visa clearance will be lower, no longer necessary to pay the fee for the meeting agreement, the other for processing the application and the other for the delivery of the transport service document.
The applicant shall pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current rate will not be changed: the amount corresponding to 140 dollars per tourist visa, 150 dollars per visa in the case of applications (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars per visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to complete the interview with the consular officer, but only turn to the nearest ASC where they will submit their documents and receive fingerprints.
Given that biometric information will be collected in ASC, applicants who will request a second meeting with the Consular Division will spend a shorter time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa on consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee of $26.

NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The US Space Agency has launched a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could lead to a breakdown in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock expert on astrobiology, a science that deals with the study of origin, evolution, the spread and the future of life in space, at a press conference in the headquarters of NASA in Washington.
When she called on the press, NASA made sure she was "a discovery that is causing a break in the search for extraterrestrial life", which sparked the speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in uninhabited conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and who could imagine that they would once become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live were improved.
It is thought to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in the Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisoned for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creation of arsenic in some way makes use of its life, and it is precisely its ability that increases the likelihood that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that is on earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another, second form of life, different from what we know."
The Space Agency will announce the real progress of the findings at tomorrow's press conference.
Conference with the participating geobiologist Pamela Conradová, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who examine Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergence and Pattern are producing opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Congress Act lead to the coming of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period has not yet begun when the opposition bloc, led by the MPs of the parties to the PRD (Partido de la Revolution Democratica, Czech "Democratic Revolution" - see p.m.), PT (Partido del Labora, Czech "Stra work" - see p.m.), Convergence (Czech "Shoda" p.m.) and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalve, who declared himself an independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" in November.
Before the opening of the 60th parliamentary session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, by Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patron Montalvo, "dealed" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, since it was cut off.
This reform, repeated, begins "bapartism", because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will rule Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarito Santos Aquilar, the PRD's coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit by PAN (Partido Action, Czech "National Action Party") and Luis Cárdenas Fonsecou as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms are institutionally forming a political marginality from the impasse of the PRI (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech "Revolutionian Institutional Party") and PAN.
He clarified that during the following days they will speak to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will and, if they do not, will again be detailed by these two parties, ending the opposition coalitions.
"When I came here (opposite coalitions), I looked at it, because we're cut off from any decision, even they don't even want to consider the opinions of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence stated that they are in agreement with the PRD, PT and the Pattern, and that is why they will form a plurality group.
It is not possible to allow, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolized, was now "double".
Aspirating reform of the law is not that there is endless bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT explained that at the present time Congress became "usual" two - in violation of PAN and PRI.
"Before she was ruled by only one side, two of them are divided today."
Mr Montalvo asked for respect for the Parliament's personality to be given a place at the negotiating table.
"In order for the five of us, who are likely to be nine, but right now they see us in five, not to be left behind because of the clandestine agreements, each of us in another group, we have agreed to find a place at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform that they have created and voted against, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform."
Extra 200 thousand pesos for "adder"
Workshops in Mazatlán will pay another check discussed owners of the company supplying electrical equipment.
Another check for something more than 200 thousand pesos was sent to the councillor Loreno Guadalupe Camach's Palazuelos.
This amount paid in this second half of the year by the owner of the supplying electromaterial shall be spread to 1,20,000 pesos.
According to the advice's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November of this year, it was exposed to 200,144,56 pesos and as its subject was mentioned as "a balance of unpaid payments".
The depositary Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the neighborhood would pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme Audit Office for sales at high prices, another volume.
What was not said is the total amount that the councils still owe her, and how many more cheques will be sent in favour of Camach's Palazuelos.
"There was nothing purchased now, only what we owe her, as well as other suppliers," he said in one interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this company has not yet been published in the Government's letter, as the law in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office is in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the depositary has ensured that the services of the consultant have not been used again.
In the previous period, after 25 July, Noroest published a review of the cheques presented by his suppliers, which revealed that during the three-year period of the old days of Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camachė Paluzuelos paid more than 10 million pesos by means of 42 checks.
It also carried out a transaction with Jumapam, where it was carrying out checks on more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places necessarily need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about an accident by a foreign tourist because of the bad state of the Sanchez Taboady text in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the depths of Sanchez Taboady, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asks the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in bad shape and do not show such a port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Zone of Dorad, recalled that they repeatedly requested that they take care of the concept of destination, and the wrong things the tourists here find to replace with new activities or routes.
He pointed out that the bad state of the streets and pedestrians is affecting tourists who are passing through here and seeing disorder, which adversely affects close businesses.
"Policies don't know what it's like to shut down a business for one day, and they have no idea about the markets they're avoiding, otherwise these issues would not be solved for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused the lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the council.
"The workshop will have to take responsibility and prevent such a repetition, will have to devote preventive maintenance, not only to correct existing problems," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, we should be maintaining it, but also as residents we deserve clean housing, the councils should change their city maintenance strategy."
Other places that appear to be neglected and poor are noted, for example, the Mazatlán Emblem and El Venadito (monument, socha jelena - no later).
"In order for tourists to arrive today, it is not just a promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city with the purity of its beaches and streets, where the constant maintenance of tourist attractions is being carried out," he said.
"There was no need for attention here, and these facts highlight something that is well known, maintenance is missing.
He talked about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the consultant, said that priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive, because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, a sub-secretary of the Tourism Promotion, said that saving tourist sites in Mazatlán is inappropriate because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and space, which will need to be set up first in order to attract these places and to bring them into the list we have to promote this destination."
IP requests for Congress results
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, would like the Members to take on a great responsibility by setting an example in looking for a better Sinaloy, in the various challenges he faces.
The parliamentary term of office and without agreement between the parties and the State Executive requires the business sector in Mazatlán, as Sinaloa is facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 of the PAN, three of the Party Nueva Alliance, two of the PRD, one of the PTs, one of the Convergence and the last of the VAT, has been launched, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations of the new members of Congress is to enable them to carry out proper management, commitments to the company and to the various areas requiring responsible legislative work and not to repeat the same sideline and Patrolist patterns.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the newly elected 40 Members of the Congress take on a great deal of responsibility and set an example on the road to a better Sinalou in the various challenges he faces.
"We expect Members to actually exercise their rights without agreement between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become the driving forces of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
He therefore spoke of the need to confirm the obligation to establish the necessary overlap, which would move the ruling forward according to the order.
"We want them to do a decent job, and they were primarily committed to companies and sectors, because they were the people of Sinaloa who gave them their voice in the past elections of confidence."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel association, said that one of the greatest challenges for 40 national representatives would be to take all the power to achieve economic growth in the country, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important is to stimulate economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support the creation of jobs in a certain way."
With regard to travel, he asked for new legislators to give him greater weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is inappropriate because it is an important economic activity, bringing in value and investment, which is also directly competing with agriculture."
In addition to spending funds on start-up tourism projects, Congress should help add the state to security and help with the alcohol law that has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
Looking for Three Kings
Girls, cars and bicycles are together with other players on the wish list of children in the family of the Coronad Valenzuel.
For their parents, it will be difficult for the three kings to fulfill their ideas about the coming festival, since their home is read by just 12 people and one bereavement.
But Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kašpar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them toys and clothes that they so long for.
The family lives in a modest settlement in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father has no permanent work.
"Sometimes we have a hard time selling on the street, because the husband is not lucky, but we're selling mandarins and potatoes...
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like Miss Barbie.
As for ten-year-old José Alfred, he'd want a "monster" car for a while, and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesuse, Cayeta would like to dress in size for one year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I wish I had this monster car', but I told him 'we'll see the son' because it was very expensive," recalls Cayettean's sadness.
For older children who were just in school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
Maria Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a size of 12, ten-year-old Isaiah size 10, where eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks tennis, so he'd have a couple of sizes of five and a half or six.
If you want to help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Coronad Valley family, you can take part in the campaign "See the Three Kings", and at the reception of the journal Noroest bring a gift or money in cash.
14 suspected drug dealers who were arrested
Ten visits were carried out in Austria, on Wednesday, in the framework of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of the Indian rope.
Fourteen people were arrested and faced with various charges.
The visits took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that served to produce drugs.
"Approximately 750 waves of Indian rope, four kilograms of hash, money and equipment that served the production was fun," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec police spokesman.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom were considered to be the bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
The detainees had to go to the courthouse in Sherbrook following their arrest.
They could face charges against the production of an Indian rope, its holding with a view to dealing with it, bribery and theft, among others.
These surveys were carried out following a long-term investigation, which lasted for almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to join these arrests," M. Ruel said.
This police operation was attended by 70 regional police officers investigating the city of Estrie State Police Quebec, State Police in Sherbrook and the Police Administration of Sherbrook Memphrémagog.
Illicit migration will be able to continue without problems.
The proposal of the law of conservatives, which, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will be clearly overcome while all three opposition parties on Wednesday announced that they could not support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
"I'm standing right on the side of the party that built a yellow under your feet," said the chief of Liberals Michael Ignatieff, a surrounded MP after a weekly meeting of the du caucus.
Liberals insist that the draft law, as proposed, which would allow any person from the ship identified as a ship crossing illegal immigrants to retain the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom within one year.
Chief of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill because he was pointing to the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism on immigration issues, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms that wish her party not to be strong enough as regards illegal immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrat agrees with the adoption of measures against illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider to be the bare part of another bill, C-35," Mrs Chow said.
"We do not support the proposal for a Conservative law because it clears guilt on refugees and places children in prison for at least one year," explained Mrs. Chow.
The immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition.
"The Canadians collectively tell the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada into a man and deal with it as a pathologist."
They expect Canada to take the following measures, Minister Kenny responded.
The government did not vote for confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to the elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government would request a vote so that any MP who objected would respond from his position in front of his electors.
The new unit does not mean uniformity
Despite the announcement that it is possible to establish a permanent unit for the fight against corruption and coliseum, many observers continue to require the establishment of a public investigation commission for the problem.
Minister for Public Security Robert Dutil has been trying to keep this idea from being forgotten: Québec intends to consult this issue with the Department of Investigation in New York in January next year.
Metropolis has a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why the Tuesday announcement of one of us was a surprise.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Police Service Council in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, there was no need for the public security criticism, the party of PQ Stéphane Bergeron, to consider this announcement as "a rabbit drawn from the hat" and "a amateur solution crushed on the knee".
Minister Dutil himself replied to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the future of the unit.
"He's satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjean Parenta, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness hearing in public transfer.
"In addition, Mr Charest is determined that he does not want to set up this committee of inquiry, and people think, like you and me, that he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of an investigative commission is by demise Jean Charesta," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and politics in the Institute for the Education of High Officials.
In order to get out of this blind alley, he proposed to Quebec to grant special powers to the Inspector General to investigate the colloquium and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
It also feels that Quebec could give the inspector the same authority as the commissioners who allow people to bring them to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the records of Charest's government.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Criminal Law, so that it would be better suited for this type of criminal activity.
This requirement would stem from the mandate for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), which informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marca Fournier that the case law in this kind of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his fellow judge, Rob Nicholson, is just dealing with some of the amendments related to this letter.
During the operation of the 2001 Jaro, which served as a group of bikers, while the Criminal Lawyer had not yet been corrected, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Law on Gangstery.
Rivers under strict surveillance.
A number of water flows have been under strict control due to strong precipitations that have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius, there was a dry land.
Two houses were prevented from being evacuated.
There was another earthquake in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's jammed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by a strong impact, i.e. from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 more millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday evening, according to the regions.
In the north of the river and in the valley of Outauais, the most affected.
It could be up to 100 millimeters down there.
If we count these droplets with the snow that we collect in some sectors, we can be afraid of flooding in some watercourses.
The Quebec Rescue Service announced on Wednesday night a warning against the danger of floods for the Ouereau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in Les Laurentides, and in Chene, in Lotbinière, have become the subject of flood preparedness and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudière they caused severe precipitation of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the result of the strong rains was a one-stop bridge.
Two residences had to be prevented from being evacuated.
In the Outauais, some of the lakes of the coast caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontenfract.
The rescue service has emergency and is monitoring the situation in this area, led by Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Water Forecast Centre issued on Wednesday warning against strong floods for several rivers, in particular Maskinong, Assomption, Ouereau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loop.
Dupont partially slandered
Quebecan broadcaster Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial decisions concerning social assistance and Haitians and, as well as a rough statement during the broadcast.
The Board for Broadcasting and Television finds that Mr Dupont and his group of CHOI 98,1 FM were entitled to express their views, but some of the opinions contained "inaccurate information about social assistance and inaccurate negative exclusion of the Haitians from gross statements that do not correspond to the broadcasts during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussion on suicide, including the sending of names to both persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules for the sending of the public.
The Broadcasting and Television Council received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken following the complaint from the Joint Front of the beneficiaries of the social support of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts indicated in the submission were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not false.
As for suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the report was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of daily life.
"Most of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of sending "Dupont's Southern News" have come to the attention of a delicate subject in a disproportionate and appropriate manner."
There was no exodus to him.
The last dispute concerned a statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort went to a media shooter that triggered a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator said he didn't send any gifts to help the Haitians, because we can't know for sure that they're really gonna get the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates inaccurately negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already opened up my class allowance for that thing."
"My list has been intact for one and a half years," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission shall refuse to use in sending a rough statement.
In any event, the CHOI-FM broadcasts cooperated "on the basis of their obligations".
For a station which will have to notify, inter alia, this decision once during the main transmission within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King of the Kung-fuva Montreal.
Resident Montreal, originating in Algeria, Nacereddine Earthmal, has an extremely special time.
An athlete who excels in the "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), in the kickbox and the Thai box enters the world's dads and rings and is looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts such as kung fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Earthmal, whose name has been living in the capital since 2008 to be taught by professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches a little everywhere, because for those who don't like a game on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this man, who works as a protection and as a helper to UPS, just gave his competitors bad news when he won two gold medals at the World Championship at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickbox full contact and Thai box, I mentioned."
"I am currently preparing for China at the World Cup in a dream show."
"Friends who finished the first four in the last world championship were invited in every category."
"In Toronto in 2009 I won the bronze."
"In 2005 I finished eight in Vietnam."
"In 2007 in China, I finished the fifth morning tournament, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished the third, added."
"It's interesting that I've made some progress in every competition."
"I'm going to be at this pace the first year or so!"
"san show" or "sand" is a discipline originating from China, where are punches of feet and feet, as well as ground casts, allowed.
The matches are traditionally played on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, born of this form of combat, is an American of the Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
No matter how Nacer Earth has to keep one result in his career, he will courageously confirm his participation in the super tournament "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a nice guy."
"It's a little equivalent for the Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Earthmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before he suffered loss in the finals.
"The one who beat me was a real professional, analyzed."
"There are four rivals per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winning semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winnings of each category are defeated so that the only champion, King kung fu, can be crowned."
450 million leased without public competition
Hydro-Québec agreed after an agreement of 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this lab, more than 100 contracts are just the consortium created by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, which received the most important contract, a contract to manage the whole project of $295 million without public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of Energie Gerance, was complemented in 2004 in conjunction with the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for managing this significant hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Energie gérance" consortium won a lucrative contract without any public declaration.
For the Quebec side, the complaint to the consortium of companies before us poses a serious ethical problem, which risks exclusion of competition and leads to price increases.
"It's a new way to realize the collusion and eliminate competition."
"This means that people, the side agreements are no longer secret, they are already open today," said PQ Sylvain Simard yesterday at a press conference.
About something earlier, in the morning, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he says it's difficult to carry how the public interest can be so sold.
The Ministry of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, in the afternoon, refused to object to this contract for a coliseum.
"I have my own way," she churned and claimed that the PQ was "undeserved" and "lost accuracy."
She said "it would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for the creation of a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
It is usually an alliance limited in time that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise so that they can respond to the call for proposals for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the scope of the work.
The construction is already in progress and has to be disbursed by 2012.
However, the contract was admitted without competition; it was a trade.
It must also be acknowledged that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, nor in relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir discovered last week, the form of a consortium in the field of engineering advice is the subject of government investigation.
If we fly over the Quebec companies' trade register at speed, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been created.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; name it CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and they're tens, leads to one and the same legal person, and that's Dessau.
With regard to the consortium Energie gérance, Minister Normandeau has particularly supported the fact that "the territory of La Baie James is typical of the special dynamics of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been reacting to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), explained that we were forced to withdraw from the fact that the project management contract was concluded after mutual agreement.
"If you go to public competition and if there are few participants in the competitions offering, your bids may be higher."
"You have two options to choose: that is, you pick up the people who are in the contract as participants in the competition, and you say, "Let's make a deal with satisfaction and a good price."
"But the main idea is that important is not the price, but the competence of people," said Mr Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energie gérance consortium is part of the long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ on the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir entered into 109 engineering consulting contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their subsidiaries, in particular with laboratories, carrying out soil analysis.
SNC-Lavalin has acquired 22 contracts, of which Genivar has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a share in the Energy Gerance.
All contracts have been concluded.
They total $449 783 344, including a contract with Energie gérance for $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard pointed out that four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor Group) are "very well known Quebec Liberal sides".
Minister Normandeau issued a report that the PQ was also linked to the companies that "funded it" before clarifying that it was more about its managers.
Barometer responsible consumption - "green" label does not boost trust
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in the "unbiased" labels and environmental certification, in order to manage accordingly in the selection of products.
The worst part is that even though we are buying in a media space that forces us and invites us to socially responsible consumption, this media space is calling for a lack of reliable information, a failure to meet obligations that even qualify as a brake for its commitment, Barometer is responsible for the consumption that came out of the first article yesterday.
Although the consumption of so-called responsible products increased in 2010, the people of Quebec who are trying to sell them still do not believe too much.
Two thirds of us actually say that they don't believe in the promises made by companies with regard to the environment, just because green advertising companies, they find a measuring instrument that has been developed by the Observatory for Responsible Consumption at the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: Half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the reliability of products and labels that are designated as environmentally responsible, indicate Barometer.
In the same way, policy debate on this issue is accepted as a serious only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
However, information on responsible consumption appears to be a first step in stimulating this page of consumption, which is now being recovered by nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable nature of the information would dampen the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Barometer at a higher price of these products.
Finally, a third of the inhabitants of Quebec are indiscriminately aware of the data on the products or the "green" services that we are looking for to let them go through with our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and in particular to change the brand of one or more products that would respond to their beliefs.
A total of 61% of them made purchases to traders from their quarter and gave preference to the purchase of food grown in their region, says Barometer.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québec is happy to present itself as a king of recycling, who strives for the least environmental impact by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental awareness remained somewhere outside their vehicle, says Barometer: in 2010, almost 28% of Quebec's inhabitants said they were using mass transport or recommending the use of cars to drive at least two people in the interests of nature protection.
The walk and the wheel also supported 39.1% of the participants in this extensive study of behavior who used this cliché.
State loan for the redemption of the kin eXcentris complex
The Government of Quebec, which we asked for a financial contribution to the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris Angus et le Parallele, agrees with the participation, but only to the amount of the loan.
The development company "Angus et le Parallelèle", which sought a donation of $7 million from the minister of culture for the purchase of a cinematographic complex at the Boulevard of Saint-Laurent and which proved its mission as a movie art lover, did not receive what she requested.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under its own conditions.
More than the expected gift is proposed by the Government of Quebec for a loan, which would otherwise be lower, some initial expectation that could form the basis for a viable solution under favourable conditions and with resources from the State.
The first action plan and demand of 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last year in the spring, but applications have already been reviewed for reduction.
The proposal and action plan were sent by the Prime Minister of the Society for the Development of Enterprise in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallelèle et Angus has time until December 31st to answer.
However, it seems that the State's gift hypothesis must be truly rejected.
Let us remember that the Association of Movie Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec has opposed the direct investment of the State in order to be able to support the purchase of eXcentris, bearing in mind that the Minister of Culture is not supposed to finance a real estate project when he did not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several participants in the debate called for basic economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the space of his films over ten years of film art after he himself funded the complex building, which could have been the reason for the state's financial board change.
The lack of rooms for independent films is cricketing in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to get a constant clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his head, is leading a campaign to release funds into the private sector, believing that he will save $700,000 to press the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, the only three film companies, Le Parallel, continue to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27th next year and celebrate the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remember Le Devoir, and so he ignores, he and his group think about the proposals for reduction that were made to him.
Upstairs to Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic frameworks mentioned in the knowledge via WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex minority of Canadians towards Americans, but those who with the impact reflect their feeling of superiority towards Canada.
American diplomats are therefore amazed that every Canadian electorate lies in the heart of Canadian-American relations when he goes to vote, and believes that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government to accept her budget in 2009!
Four new reports from the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, last night exposed to public opinion, provide additional sensitive details to get each other "under the skin".
The communication with the date of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details the point in which the United States is not part of the bets discussed by the political leaders.
To a great fan of the U.S. embassy in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides several explanations to this situation.
"The Canadian minority complex, almost inflexible, may remind political leaders to talk about internal commitments instead of realizing that these elections concern the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
"The United States is, then," he concluded, "a verbal elephant in these elections:everywhere possible but potentially too dangerous to talk about them."
The Ambassador understands this "declaring silence" less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, party or even better the leader of the party to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that the voters have in mind when they go to the elections."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure that the government retains its confidence in the beginning of February, with regard to the federal budget that Canada publicly recognises its first deficit for more than ten years, for the recovery plan of between $30 billion and $40 billion," writes M. Breese.
There is no mention of the fact that the government had to reject the pre-Natural parliamentary meeting so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties recalled their survival quality of the proposed renewal plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington that the most negative image that the United States is throwing into the drama series sent to the CBC.
The messenger is concerned about sending Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there can be no too vague references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for the purposes of violent investigations by the CIA.
Another report points out that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accept some prisoners with Guantanam.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the "case of the case".
At the end of the meeting, it says, "He passed some paper on Omara Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, a state secret."
"The Secrets have been adopted by the fact that the file is being audited."
Let's finally note that the people who are dealing with WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former consultant very close to Stephen Harper, announced on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "destroyed".
It came out and heard about it and Mike Huckbee in the United States.
World plan for the revitalization of light
Yesterday, in Cancún, the United Nations proposed a plan for the reconstruction of domestic lighting, trade lighting and industrial space in 100 countries with a view to achieving a greenhouse effect limitation (GES), which corresponds to nearly one third of the next limit to be achieved in order to stabilise the climate of the planet from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to launch in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult realistic commitments to reduce industrially advanced countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the extinguished lamps, which monopolies another 50 to 70% of the market, replace fluo-compact lamps or, even better, with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED"), the primary quantity of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet for lighting would be discouraged.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's an equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the car park all over the planet.
In Kodana last year, large countries with a significant share in emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary plans to reduce the global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will need to be removed from this balance sheet another 5 Gt in order to achieve the stabilisation of climate warming to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 so that it can be excluded that it will not be out of control.
In blasted lamps, 95% of the energy is diluted in the form of heat and residues, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluorescent lamps, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new LED lamps, we reduce this consumption twice again.
Fluo-compact lamps shall last from 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
New lamps with DEL, those that led Philips this week - this company allegedly participated in the UN study - have the estimated lifetime of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than the flashlight, which gives us an idea of a possible savings with a refund plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new lamps can also work with the residues and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed reservations to fluo-compact lamps because they contain mercury and it is necessary to classify it as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, as producers would set up collections.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluo-compact lamp, but rather a warm coal power plant that emits many mercury needed to produce the electricity emitted in bursting lamps.
In the United States alone, these centres run 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report also gives details of the profits that each country would have from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save billions of dollars a year for purchasing electricity and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 heat plants, whose construction would be 2.5 billion
The coasting of elephants eagerly awaits the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections on the coast of Slovenia after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the preliminary results immediately, highlighted the US Speaker."
"He requires all parties in the Coast of Slovenia and the institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the notice of provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the worst date - the middle of the night - to come, without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's collapse.
About 40 minutes before the deadline was expired, President CEI on TV confirmed that the Commission "continued to work" in order to be able to deliver the results.
In the middle of the world , challenges have been compounded to finally declare the name of the winner of the second round, between the retreating Laurent Gbagbo and the member of the opposition Alassan Ouattara.
But the camp of Gbagbo is based on the cancellation of the Constitutional Council for the "underwater" vote in the north, which is corrected by the former Assembly of the New Army (FN) since the failure of the coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in the Coast of Slovenia, confirmed that the manoeuvres of terrorizing the wills practiced by the UN (New Army) in the north of the country have disproved the presence of the President of the Coast of Slovenia from going to the poll.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council looked at the complaint that Gbagbo filed.
However, President Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political associate of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who dementes any connection with the former rebellion, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has suffered loss and that he submits a complaint to the Constitutional Council after he has defended the election commission from sending the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, held on Sunday, was considered a coronation of the process of reunification and alignment of the country, which has been divided into two and a half years.
The United Nations pointed out in the middle of a political group on the coast of Slovenia that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished his first round on October 31, as a winner with 38% votes against 32% for Alassan Ouattaru, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The measure of unemployment in France, in terms of words according to the International Labour Office (ILO), remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including the eastern regions), as shown by the provisional data on seasonal deviation corrections (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed was 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in metropolis and 9.7% of the marine area.
In one year, the unemployment rate is increased by 0.1.
In the wider picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but they would like to work, regardless of whether they are or are not available for two weeks to work and whether they are looking or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has yet to be addressed by a new increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points per three months, +0.5 points per one year) and 25% of the maritime areas.
In the third quarter, there were 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24.
In the case of seniors, they recorded in metropolitan France a slight increase in unemployment to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points per three months, as well as in the year), which is 482,000 people from 50 years of age and 6.6% including the eastern regions.
Only the population aged 25-49 recorded benefits from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point in three months, +0.1 point in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after the debate on its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the Statistical Agency of the European Union, on the contrary, continues to produce monthly statistics and announced a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and imprisoned
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the bosses of the waste management company and the brother of PS The Management Board of Bouches-du-Rhône, was accused and imprisoned in the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation into public procurement, believed to be subjugated.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of abuse of the property of the company, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, payment, acceptance of fees for the purpose of affecting the office and holding the shooting, his lawyer states.
"Alexandre Guérini is a fighter and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions he intends to ask, and not any overcrowding."
"It's easy to track her for a lot of criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove her," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told his client.
Mr Guérini informed his lawyers that he had sent a brief statement before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his closest friends, Philippe Rapezi, was also accused and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simona, his client has never done anything else than to ensure the functioning of the assets he was supposed to manage.
As regards the award of contracts or the destination of the funds associated with their operation, he never knew of any such thing, Mr Simon said.
In this regard, Daniel Pinna, former director-general of Aubagne's services, was accused on Wednesday of abuse of public funds and plots, and left free, under judicial supervision, to face the ban, protagonists of all matters.
"My client has been able to give an explanation of all the facts that have been revealed to him."
"The investigating judge will take care of it and let it go," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were accused and released at night from Tuesday to Wednesday, having been under judicial supervision for the two of them, the representative of state attorney Michel Raffin introduced.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director-general with the elegance of Marseille Province Metropole (MPM), is charged with the acceptance of payments for the purpose of affecting the Office and for passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier agglomeration are accused, one for "depression and abuse of the property of society", the other for "complexity in the abuse of public funds".
Finally, commercial partner Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "absorbing the abuse of the company's property".
Among those who were confronted with Mr. Guérin is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently accused in the parallel case of fraudulent public contracts concerning Corsica.
Investigators suspect that his company has helped to clean up the money from the vast gangstery.
The investigation shall be conducted in the context of several open investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in closing public contracts, in particular in the matter of waste.
From the source of the close investigation, the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the plant in La Ciotat, which collects wastes from Aubagne, as well as from some cities in the city of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: Elyse Palace overrun the Syrian mediators
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotildy Reissov, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "spionage", united his views in France, introduced diplomacy into the war preparedness and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this has been carefully monitored by diplomats from the United States.
American documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the advantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elise Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such cases by hand in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how the leading French representatives tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French was not compensation for the release of Majida Kakavanda, Iran imprisoned in France and sought by the US for subterranean trade in material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reflect the sharp light of the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotildy Reiss.
He actually didn't do anything for it.
Diplomatic telegram, written on 12 August 2009 in Paris, has the title: "Iran:French comment on how to resolve the case in the case of handcuffs".
Counsellor of the Elise Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by Director Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrick Paoli, spoke with the representative of the American diplomat Allegrone.
They explain his French method.
They recommend that the Americans do likewise so as to be transported back to their own government by violence detained in Iran.
"Do noise," they say, "always say "in the media the words "the fundamental right of man", "innocentness", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to bring into disrepute an Iranian regime that is sensitive to its image.
"Do it more than they'll ask you to stop it."
Because attempts have been made to negotiate through discreet channels, "the quiet does not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters of avoiding manoeuvres".
Mr. Richier reminds us that arresting foreigners is "the Iranian family of tactics: taking arms for the purposes of "political extermination".
It states that the liberation of Clotildy Reissov (which will take place on 16 August, on the day the French Embassy gives it refuge) "requests the payment of a high financial amount to the Iranians" (see EUR 230,000).
And they'll announce that the Elise Palace is anticipating cases of hostages, a phenomenon that will "resurrection".
Iranians could "in the future arrest about 1800 French people living in Iran", he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilda Reissová left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, which the United States declares was released for illegal trafficking in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
The American embassy, as well as many observers, is asking for this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which pursues an illegal Iranian network for the acquisition of nuclear material, the release of Majida Khakavanda is a bad report.
France agreed to a contract?
Freedom of Iran for the liberation of young French?
In another conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4th, François Richier makes sure it isn't.
The Elyse Palace, as it may say, was not only "as surprised by this judge's decision", but was looking for an opportunity to stand up to it.
"The talks were held between the President's Office and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the decision of the court," he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "restricted" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Counsellor of the Elise Palace is turning the phone number off, hangs the phone and then informs the American diplomat that Iran is currently in the Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy."
At the time of Klotildy Reissov's imprisonment in Iran, the Elyse Palace of Efforts, negotiates, through communications and organized "only" media to convince Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad to play "significant" and "impact" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity, not without irony, and note that manipulation is bearing its fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the official French version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blast" of French officials".
What is the basis of such a "thank you" measure, expressed to M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Even through their declaration, full of praise to French officials in private recognize that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elise Palace to pay in this fiction.
The intensive communication "directs to the validation of the policy of President Sarkozy's opening to Syria", analyzes.
Policy implemented in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "how to overcome the Syrian role", Paris strives to "demonstrate Syria what praise can be enjoyed when it plays a constructive role in the area".
The aim is also "to plant a grain gap between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a very good source.
August 11th, François Richier confessed to him, "We certainly don't know if the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is"
"But still we thanked them."
"This should at least introduce confusion and uncertainty among Iran."
Clotilda Reissová is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to Elise Palace.
In the communication, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the benefit of the liberation of our landscape".
End of online game after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will pass a law called "Peciválski", which will forbid adolescents to play online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, the responsible government actors have introduced.
The draft law will be submitted to Parliament in December in order to ask for companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight for persons under 16 years of age, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of the Family have introduced.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems with school education and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, a leading factor in the ministry, who has a draft law on care.
Online games will be new available from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law to clarify.
The government also assumes that it requests companies to limit daily access time to these games for young people whose parents are asking for it to be completed by the responsible employee.
It also provides free programs to people who ask for it, allowing them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the country's most "depressed" and daily printing regularly brings different facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is an undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at World Cyber Games, which faces 58 other nations.
World Championship in 2018-2022: Fifa creates host countries.
The FIFA Executive Committee will establish a full-fledged concern about corruption on Thursday of the World Cup host country in 2018 and 2022, a highly politically motivated selection where the fight for influence and lobbying risks that they will meet the technical criteria.
The thing is certain, the Royal Fifa competition in 2018 will take place in Europe , the traditional garden of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 Championship will be much more exotic, while the International Federation hopes to succeed in gaining new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the 2010 African continent premiere, or continue to be established in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities participating in the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government actors Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides an opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political achievements worldwide.
Negotiations in the background face the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the remainder, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to Fifa's assessment report, English, Spanish-Portugal (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as their competitors' documentation.
However, these reasons will not be too important for 22 members of the executive committee at the time appointed for the vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelation, leading to the suspension of two members of the EC/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temaria et Amos Adamu) may thus have destroyed the chance of his country, a colébeck dug, which has so far hosted the world championship only once a year.
The BBC put the crown on Monday when it sent a document that "printed on a sponge" by three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa unhappy and lead to trouble by the English leader with David Cameron in the first row.
The president hopes that he will be able to repeat the experience of his predecessor in the role of Tony Blair, who in 2005 managed to win the London Olympics organisation in 2012.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient for England to add a new light on its name to the EC (European Commission?)?
There is nothing less certain because the two Spanish-Portugals are missing the drums of the already prepared stadiums, their well-being (The World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitious cold showers.
Where appropriate, legal measures against the English and doubts about the payment capacity of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was also outsider in its documentation (stations, hotels, transport).
But the president of the government, Vladimir Poutin, decided that the championship would not be moved to Zurich and publicly declared 'no competition in the preparation of the vote', in verbal attacks only barely charged with the English press against the members of the EC (European Commission).
"We'll throw them in the mud, try to compromise them," said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, they seem to be a logical favorite of the United States with their significant experiences since 1994.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the home of the main sponsors of Fifa, seems to have a great drive ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have developed a beautiful project.
But these candidatures seem to be premature for both countries, which together in 2002 produced a "test".
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Championships in China, which feverishly desires Fifa, has made Asia’s chances for the year 2022 invalid.
With Katara, who pulled out of the hand a large show in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue in its expansion to new landscapes, but these two countries represent more risks than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, would be able to watch for flat-rate TV charges (for the time movement) paid by European countries, forming a mobile force for Fifa.
Second mandate: visibility (safety)
De Gaulle really hurt.
Mitterrand has raised his opinion that he weighs.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not escape at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than they are.
Ordering the Elise Palace to call someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be the candidate in 2012.
But obviously it is not in good faith with the share of the secret associated with the presidential function.
It is therefore necessary to do as if the doubts persist.
In one sense or another.
In 2006, or would you like to believe it, friends of Jacques Chirac made claims not to exclude the third mandate.
On November 15, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy ensured that "sometimes in the autumn of 2011" will be decided.
As the members of the UMP's parliament recall Wednesday night at the Elise Palace, the perspective of the "two mandates" has been a little hot.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far away.
The President only recalled that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year functional periods to two.
It was just his findings, not his announcement.
It's not the first time she remembers the humourous tone of the presidential election at such meetings.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you have yet seven and a half years ahead of you with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: "Don't think I don't consider another stage."
His earlier judgments shall not make him a candidate more than the previous day; nor shall he make him a candidate or less.
If they're making comments, it's because of the double truth.
Speeding the way to the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to Ségolén Royal's collaborator, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
On the contrary, it is because his 2012 candidacy is evident that many in the PS want to organize the fighting structures earlier than intended.
Bad research on the other side.
First, right-wing voters would prefer Françoise Fillon's candidacy against Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy (46%) versus 44% according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we don't ask about that issue with the UMP," responded immediately and cautiously to people from the closest environment of the government president.
"If they believe in possible defeat, they won't run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe that he can win," corrects Alain Juppe, who is clearly balanced.
The euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue in its procurement of public securities.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central Year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for the removal of the crisis or, at least, a notice of the suspension of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations that have to be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of European demand is committed, and the institution for issuing securities will certainly not be able to allow itself to be so categorically under the threat of deterioration of the situation that is already so high on European securities markets today.
The political price would be higher in that case.
Yesterday, at the occasion of the press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde gave up the holding of an active role played by the European Central Bank in the interests of resolving the crisis of the debt of European states.
She didn't mean to say if she thought the bank could do more, for example by increasing their program to buy overdraft bonds.
"I take my view of my European partners (...)".
The evening before, in Brussels, when the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not prove to be more decisive as regards his intentions, and he was satisfied that he stated that the programme for the purchase of sovereign securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting that will take place this Thursday.
The only guarantee: the European Central Bank will monitor its basic unchanged interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of bonds from the deposit made by the European Central Bank doubled by nearly EUR 1.35 billion over the last week.
And because of the lack of understanding of the buyers on the market, she made yesterday a new purchase of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
The Eurosystem’s total central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There are no doubts between the buyers on the market regarding the continuation of the purchase (see page 29).
Nor do economics expect any significant change in the course.
If the loan operation has already disappeared for more than three months from the European Central Bank’s arsenal, this last-named bank shall apply to the unlimited provision of liquid assets under generous conditions and for a period of one week to three months.
Economics today expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine that she would change her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean taking the risk of triggering a short-term new tension," says Michael Schubert, a Commerzbank economist.
"The progressive eastern part announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," says Norbert Brams, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its public debt market interventions, "the European Central Bank must maintain the volume of purchase of its bonds to revive the soft market," Norbert Brams adds.
Given the exposure of European banks to the euro area debt on the markets, there is nothing more to be chosen than to keep their presence on the market.
"It is necessary to replace the lack of investors on the market at any price and to act in such a way as to prevent the implementation of the State's payment performance, which is among the most fragile," a prominent bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates have flown, the countries will be more concerned to reduce their debt rather than stabilise it.
It's saving the euro for this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is behind the back
At the beginning of the week, the worrying situation for Italy was a little relaxed, with a return rate of ten years.
Return to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Prime Minister of Economics, they said that they heard Giulia Tremonti, how he qualified the situation as "unsolved" and that he expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then demented.
In any case, in Tuesday, apart from the long German interest rates, a record of 210 basic points was reached and the price of the anti-bankruptment contracts (CDS) ran up to 263 points, causing certain disturbances in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said of himself that he was "too busy" "with the rapid development of markets" and possibly with a possible infection of origin from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the absence of growth and indistinct fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and exposes it to the risk that it will not be able to cover its funding needs.
The last predictions of Brussels were for the government a cold shower.
Italy's growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, calculated by the European Commission, the public finances deficit will still account for 4.3% of the gross domestic product next year (to 3.9% of the government forecast) and 3.5% in 2012 (notably 2.7%).
From this point of view, a new summary of the additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the celebrations, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken", evaluation by Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
At this point, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
"The basic stones of its economies are fine and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating it for a long time," assures Arigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Governing Council of the International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, no short-term or long-term, because over its considerable debt (119.2% of the gross domestic product 2011, NDLR), the effort to stabilise Italy is less than the effort required by the other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD chief economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a proposal to express the mistrust of the Ambassador's House and could then begin to organise the elections that will be held at the end of March.
This would be the beginning of a period, which is not appropriate for a decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde again stressed this yesterday in the framework of the Paris press conference: "I think that Europeans have demonstrated it on Sundays throughout the day and night, are obviously a lot of solidarityal determinations, commitment to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although everything is relative, last night's recorded expansion, with regard to interest on European state bonds, has brought water to governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The Authority for Standard & Poor's notes announced that it could degrade the record of Portugal's debt, the goal to which various speculations are most focused.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and a clear policy, particularly on banking systems," says Economous Exane BNP Paribas.
More that "political time is running slower than market time".
The knowledge of this disrupted relationship and the dangers it poses are intensifying the European countries of discussion, which aim to strengthen the existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected by the problem, and in a broader way with their G20 counterparts, are taking place very well.
This is due to Eurogroup meetings (Eurogroup) and Ecofin meetings from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is taking place today.
The programme contains a decision on non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries with a market focus (see above).
As regards the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, launched a trip to Singapore on Tuesday to Asia to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
Unless the purpose of this journey is to increase the funds, the donor prepares the soil to achieve this objective.
The first issue of the ESF securities shall be assumed next month.
Yesterday, the US official representative informed Reuters that the United States would support the possible increase in mobilised funds by additional direct engagement with the IMF.
The countries referred to in the first series, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are linked to a rapid-effect measure.
Lisbon and Madrid are different than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid, at any cost, requesting international aid before applying for their own budgetary corrections and before deciding on structural reforms necessary to regain their long-term confidence.
The capital participants in the European Funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the process of normalising markets with overcompensated bonds.
On his way to Paris on November 24th, Axel Weber came up with the idea that the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be more than a threat to the Union's recovery of securities.
The economics of Barclays Capital, which is an actor of the very first plan of dealing with European over-debts, considers that the EUR 100 billion addendum would be sufficient, "better" in the form of direct financial liquidity.
The medium exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, delivered to this day by 60 billion euros.
The Council, which has every chance to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions worsened.
Snow and rain: 24 countries have an orange emergency.
The snowflakes are still causing transport difficulties, especially on the roads of the second class in Britain, and there is a risk of disruption of some economic activities.
Twenty-four periods since now have an orange emergency due to the risk of snow and floods.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, Les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, have joined the 20 periods that have already announced orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, significant snowfalls occur in the north of La Gironde and Les Charentes and weak snow on Ile-de-France.
The snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the periods concerned and covers from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the Low Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions are affected.
The snowflakes are large enough to cause transport difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, says Météo France.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some periods have prohibited the passage of heavy cargo transport - a cargo car over 7.5 tons with the Guingamp-Lannion route and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac route.
Road traffic on the second-class roads in Britain is very difficult, and police recommend driving with their vehicle only if it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned in Picardia on Thursday.
On Wednesday evening, no special measures are proposed to limit freight transport.
The county office "calls all drivers of cars to be the most careful on the roads and to adapt the vehicle's nature".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has requested airlines to cancel their 25% flights on Thursday at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% at Orla on the basis of the expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that a passenger using air transport services connect with his company.
In the United Kingdom, Gatwick Airports in southern London and Edinburgh Airports in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on modernising transport to Ile-de-France in full-flow, it's been worth billions.
At least during the discussion.
We particularly recall 23 billion on the Grand Paris metro, which is to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order to enable this building to be released, he announced the state of granting a grant of EUR 4 billion.
It is purely theoretically an amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the funding from its dual source on orders.
We're finally getting to the first additions today.
The 2010 Financial Correction Act, which examines the National Assembly Financial Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms for securing these funds.
There are two: creating special tax from equipment and raising tax from office to Ile-de-France.
First, let's read in the text of the bill, Article 15, "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The yield of this interest is 117 million euros a year".
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for the office, which already exists therefore, "to be modernised to increase its profit and to increase its impact on Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it cost?
Overcrowded.
That's not counted in the text.
We've got up to 4 billion.
"It is clear that these fiscal resources are linked to 4 billion euros of capital grants that will be mobilised by the State and invested in Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in explaining the reasons.
In SGP, this system does not seem shocking to us.
"From the time we created incomes (both taxes, etc.), we can cover the study for three years and then bury up to 4 billion, it's explained here."
"It will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
The SGP considers that 4 billion will be allocated to the 2013 budget for 2014.
This mechanism, in which the promised 4 billion are still not available to subscribers, risks triggering some violent parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
City hackers and coercive investigators
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, there is a clear scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal just face in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at international level, and overcoming the future of controlled regression.
But let's do it.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm the fact that every document drawn up by a secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of printing records.
"The extraordinary revelation" of Americans about the sexual life of Berlusconihio is what has been possible to read every month in any newspaper (all other than these two Berlusconi owns), and not the caricature profile of Kadáfi has long been the object of the skilful artist.
The rule, according to which secret documents may consist only of reports already known, is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that every work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templars or Zednáří) exactly what has already been written in the previous sections.
And it's not just because the author of the occult texts does not like to read new information (or not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who are involved in occultism believe only what they already know and what they already know.
This is Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informant is lazy and lazy (or limited spirit) chief of secret services (and if he is not, he may be, as I know, editor in the Liberian newspaper), who only counts as true what he admits himself.
Information with a high secret about Berluscon, which the US embassy sent to the state resort, was the same as Newsweek published a week earlier.
Why, then, have so much practice been made about revealing these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, while the embassy, at least from the end of the second world war, and since the time when the heads of states can call or fly off a plane on a common dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in the representation, turned into a Spanish centre.
Any viewer following the films on the investigation knows very well that only by numerity it appears to be ignored.
However, the fact that this is being repeated in public, undermines the obligation to cover and sheds the wrong light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most intimately hidden information from the world's most powerful country is a hard strike, not an insurmountable one, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both victims and their "rewarders".
But let's move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Sometimes, in the days of Orwell, it was possible to grasp all power, like some Big Brother, who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell’s prophecy has been proven since the time when, thanks to the ability to control every movement by telephone, every transaction performed, the hotel visited, the road used, and so on, became a citizen of the total sacrifice of power.
But when we demonstrate how it is now that even the "grapes" with the most classified information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a loophole.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least hacker - elected as the debtor of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can you maintain power that no longer has the ability to keep your own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that true secrets are infinite secrets (and infinite secrets will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel is a truly secret infinite secret because it is derived from public life; but discovering, as WikiLeaks did, that the secret of Hillary Clinton was infinite secrets, means taking all power away from him.
WikiLeaks made no mistake at Sarkozy or Merkel's, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound of saving power so significant?
It is clear that in the future States will not be able to send on-line sensitive information - that would be equal to its publication on the poster on the corner of the street.
But it is also quite obvious that with current technologies, there is little hope that you can keep the message on the phone hidden.
It's nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of the state traveled by plane and connected with one of his colleagues.
How will they be able to be kept in the future in keeping private and sensitive news hidden?
I know well that for this moment my prognosis belongs to science-fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine the government agents who are transporting discreetly the fulfillment of uncontrollable pathways and carrying only those messages they know to remember or hide rare information in the boot.
Information will be kept in unique copies in the cartridges sealed with the key: overall, the attempt to spy in the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, that means back.
One century after the wireless telegraph meant a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Videocasettes (analogues) enabled movie lovers to film a step after step, move it in front and back and reveal all the secrets of the installation, while now CD (digits) allow only jump on the capitals, that means macropores.
Through the rapids, we will come from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the way by plane and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is not surprising, then, that politics and communication techniques will return to the horse - driven vehicles.
Last note.
Jindy tried to understand what had happened in the secret of the embassy.
Now it's a embassy asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked its funding promises
The year after the Copenhagen Agreement is the time to test compliance with the pledges for rapidly delocked financing (as referred to as fast start or early start) implemented by developed countries.
And great French hacks were discovered
In the Copenhagen Agreement, the developed countries committed to providing $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union promised EUR 7.2 billion for three years and EUR 1.26 billion for France (i.e. 420 million a year).
At the beginning of COP16, the EU drew out a large show to convince its partners about the reality of its commitment to financing the fast start: a report clarifying the actions of its Member States, the press conference, the grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparent operations are invaluable and valued at their real value: Adult countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that in 2010 it released EUR 2.2 billion, leading it to the right path for compliance with its pledge of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we find things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" in accordance with the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is realized without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement in what it means "new and additional".
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Everyone today will choose the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international financing has been maintained and it still adds 150 million to its three-year term of funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references to annual payment terms or to public development aid terms.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of the previous period or to the global level Public aid for the development of d'Aide published au development.
In particular, the overall amount of France's support to developing countries can remain unchanged (or even be reduced), should comply with its commitment to financing "new and additional"...
Another decisive element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There's no rule yet, and everyone will choose their own way of counting.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ borrowed is equal to 1€ given.
Obviously, it is difficult to demonstrate: effort is not equal.
If the use of the loan can be provided for some investments that are profitable (sometimes it is related to projects linked to the reduction of emissions, which are based on more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we get, as equivalent to one euro we give... , we should not understand it from the title of our commitments, but as the price of the loan for the credit country (i.e. the equivalent of interest rates).
However, France can only give the following reasons: "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros, making it 91.5% of the loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of the grants (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan to this extent.
Germany has requested 46% from this country, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) comply with their commitments with 100% gifts.
In other words, when the total majority of the European Union gives 1€ within the framework of its promise, France only gives 10 cents and considers this effort comparable.
A beautiful cyclist piece!
For a summary, France operates with two households in its "fast start" financing: on the one hand, with the development of shares in time and on the other hand, with real financial burden.
Although he only spends 36.1 million euros, he can convince himself that he spends 420 million euros "new and additional" in relation to his promises.
Manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that while it is Bercy who has made such a decision) could have a double negative impact, within the EU (why would Member States continue to give when it is only to borrow?) and when negotiating, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter of early financing is only a small issue, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could also be a grain of sand in a huge machine such as the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever the case, it is necessary to draw on the knowledge of this first year of early financing.
First, France should notify the change in its way of managing the accounts for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and of compliance and of fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussions on long-term funding deposits (other key chapters currently discussed): we will not miss the question of "additionality" or how to invest in loans.
France should change its position to become as progressive with these deposits as with others.
Thus, the hopes of everyone are being put into the new Ministry of the Environment, Mrs Koscisko-Morizetov, who will come to Cancún next week.
A surprising announcement about the firm start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of the loan could lead to an increase in international confidence, necessary to enable further discussion.
An alarm about the pesticides that kids look at.
Ten-year-old child has seen 81 different chemicals on one day, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Education for the Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which notes that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the processed problem", bought between July and September food commonly consumed in four foods and one light food as a light snack for one child almost a decade in supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is sharp: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are listed among the substances carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive for internal mixing glands (PE), according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical adopted individually are not exceeded, in our research we can well see that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, perhaps carcinogenic, and/or PE is infective," says the association.
For breakfast butter and tea with milk, there are about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens, as well as about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
Apple, imported from Brazil, studied as a small hamlet, contains traces of six chemicals, including the banned fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, which are included in the lunch, where studies have found the rates of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, dairy beef, tuna in the ash and even ham and gum were sprayed pesticides and other chemicals.
The presence of nitrogen and chloroform was detected in water from the tap.
The steak from salmon to dinner was "the richest" with 34 found chemical residues and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in a microwave tube did not escape analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this "cocathellum contaminants" is likely to be underestimated", according to the study.
Ecological Europe-Greens (EE-LV) has proposed "to face the urgent situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "growth of civilisation diseases".
In July, the study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the presence of 365 residues of various pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
