Purgės seller Lina Ogniscissini honors Bedford Mers.
In the picture: Lina Ognisanti is selling ice during the warm year, and in the winter it is the season.

Almost 3,000 people have signed a petition on the Internet for recognition or recognition.
Mr. Firefighters said she was honored to receive such honors.

Kelyje on Alsterio "Lambretta" Club
The Lambretta Motorolars have been unchanged in the 7th decade of fashion culture.
The group of Italian motorcyclists was trying to preserve the spirit of those times.
70 years after the first Alster Lambretta Club was established, about 100 motorists from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered in Fermana County this weekend.
One of the first two members of the club Chris Wilson acquired the first Lambretta in 1966 for about £40.
“I was only a vehicle, but I learned that I could use it in a different way.
It was such a sport.
I didn't get involved in fashion culture, and now I'm probably too old for it," he said.
"It was rather cheap and fairly reliable, you could have bought it at the price available, and you got to do something more than just go from point A to point B."
He participated in the TT Church of Art Island in a separate start-up race.
The first Alster's Lambretta club was created at the beginning of the 1980s and redesigned 12 years ago.
"About 1971 motorists and other modes of transport are becoming less and less dominant, and the clubs were generally affected by the unrest, so I thought, "This is the end," said Chris.
"At that time, there was a renewed interest and it seems to be growing more and more."
Philip Steele is the secretary of Alster's Lambretta Club, with 97 current members, responsible for the members.
‘All reasons differ.
Some members were influenced by fashion culture because almost everything started from it.
Others are racing enthusiasts or rockers – you will find all people here.
There are also those who simply have interesting vintages.
Many engines are modified, so two are not alike.
It is possible not to change the engine and to drive at a speed of 35 or 40 miles per hour, adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved.
Some highly modified motors could reach a speed of up to 100 miles per hour."
During the weekend, some motorists had to be pushed into the mud.
And although the weather in Northern Ireland is not always as pleasant as the "Lambretta" father of Italy, this time the sun for motorists driving around Fermana.
Ruth Davidson asks them to remain silent about Brexit
Ruth Davidson asked his fellow conservators for a "silence period", so that the Prime Minister could agree on Brexit.
Scotland's head said that two years after the EU referendum, the debate took place.
She expressed her opinion on Boris Johnson's premier plan, which he called "unreasonable and completely absurd".
She told the BBC Sunday Politics Scotland that it was time to support the Prime Minister.
At the party conference held in Birmingham, she said: “We have had time for discussions over the past two years.
The former Secretary of Foreign Affairs took over the role of one of the best cabinets in the history of the country, and most of the current plan, which had already been recognised last November, was prepared during that period.
The conservatives now have to support the Prime Minister, allow her to complete the transaction and help implement the plans in the country.
I think the period of silence would be very useful."
Their comments followed a sharp criticism in Brexit's debate, which was not the first time declared by former foreign secretary Boris Johnson.
In an interview with BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later confirmed that she believed in Brexit and that her cabinet plan could ensure a favourable trade deal with the European Union.
Mr Davidson also stated that he would promise to prevent the second referendum in Scotland on independence in other elections, since in 2014 "the damage was promised that such an event would be the only event in their generation".
Asked about a possible re-referendum on Brexito, she said: "If we are talking about Scotland's history, I have repeatedly stated that a referendum cannot be repeated if you are a nationalist and your result is not satisfied.
I would rather, if I were to say that there could be another referendum on Brexit, because I expected a different result."

Christine'a Blasey Ford confirmed a statement on sexual harassment suspected of Brettas Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who was in high school friends with Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford, accused the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault, when both of them were teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate Court Committee and explained that he did not even remember the evening in the house through which an attack might have occurred, but believed in Ford's story.
Previously, Keyser, through his lawyer, made a statement that he did not remember that evening and did not even know if he had agreed to Kavanaugh.
Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Court Committee on Thursday often referred to Keyser’s statement as proof of his innocence, but did not mention Keyser’s claim to believe in Ford’s words.
On Friday, the President briefed the FTB to conduct a study during the week when the Republican Senator Jeff Flake and the other senators asked for time for the investigation and for a week to postpone the whole Senate vote on Kavanaugh.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to the Committee through his lawyer saying that he wanted to "by contributing to the additional FTB investigation" on Kavanaugh.
“But, as my client has already explained, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and does not remember the evening or the meeting he would have had with or without Dr. Ford,” says Dr. Keyser, lawyer Howard Walsho.
The letter further explains that Keyser “did not reject Dr. Ford’s statement and has already told the press that he believes in Dr. Ford’s certificate.”
"But the simplest and unalterable truth is that it cannot confirm it, because it does not mention that event," continues the letter.
Kavanaugh's friend, Mark Judge, who was allegedly near the attack, also claimed to have contributed to the FTB investigation.
Illicitly, Chicago's people tell about life with a corrupt cop and get him
The Chief Prosecutor of Illinois is trying to change Chicago's police history after a dark period.
A dishonest policeman is believed to have exploited innocent people in social housing and wrongly seized many people.
To date, 42 people have been unjustly convicted.
Ida B. Wells is currently only an empty site for the project's social housing project, and their people had been using the Chicago police for more than a decade without fear of anything.
They were headed by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
The citizens accused him and his tactical camp of the abuse of property, of police reports and of the slander and of the imprisonment.
Willie's Martin and Cleonas Glober are two of those judges who have so far been tried by the Cook County Attorney General Kim Foxx.
“If you didn’t work with him, you ended up bad.
You were his enemy.
You stopped him from working and making profits," said Cleona Glober about Watts.
“I was very scared.
I wanted to get out of this area,
But I didn't have to go," said Willie's Martin.
The lawyers of the Foxx Ethics Section shall review further 30-40 cases relating to Watts.
Ida B. Wells, the resident of the social housing estate Landona Allen, said that many people decided to disagree about Watts.
“More did not happen,” he said.
"But that wasn't important."
According to another former resident, Clarissa Baker, no one believed in the people’s words about the officer in the official office.
“He has his own receipt.
Who will believe us?"
said Baker.
Joshua Tepferis, working on a project at the Chicago University of Justice, said that no one really believed in them.
"They all went away because these people didn't seem important to them, and they didn't care, because they – you're going to be black people in social life, so it was thought they were still committing something," Tepferis said.
‘Sergent Watts sat in prison for 22 months in 2013 to try to seduce FTB informants.
Martez Wise is also sentenced to Watts prison.
I just had a son.
I couldn't be with him for four years.
He almost didn't know me because he was just born, so I had to re-establish my relationship with him," said Wise.
"I lost four years without cause."
For 72 years, Fidelity believed in the success of block chains, virtual reality and artificial intelligence
The potential of Fidelity blocks has been observed until 2018 when all corporations started talking about this technology.
The Director-General, Abby Johnson, led investment in cryptovoivorates, the most risky and unconstitutional asset class in recent years.
"About two years ago, I and other senior leaders were just smarter than what's going on, especially in the bitcoin market," Johnson said.
We started to talk, and we realized that we had to figure it out.
The tricky led to the launch of the "cast" bitcoins in the New Hampshire unit, when the price of this encryption was about $180.
Last December, the price was nearly $20,000, and, according to Johnson, “we were surprised that we started to earn high prices even though we never believed it. ”
It did not indicate how many bets were "quick" or how much Fidelity was earned.
"Fidelity" employees are obviously interested in these technologies.
For workers, a block chain club called “Bitas and Blockes”, which organizes seminars and meetings with specialists, now has approximately 2,600 members.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which gave Fidelity customers an opportunity to verify the residual value of the encryption using the Fidelity mobile software.
In 2015, the possibility of offering money as bitcoins was created.
According to Johnson, the company rejected most of the other possible uses of bitcoins or at least refused them for a short time.
We're trying to monitor the market.
Until now, Katie Chase, the leading technology centre strategy for Fidelity and the leader of the Block Chain Incubator (part of FCAT), is looking for ways to use public and business-based block chains.
Chase was unable to comment on specific projects, but revealed that he was very interested in customers, partners and employees.
“Everything is very new.
If you enter into the information, you will understand that you are still trying to find the proof of the concept," says Chase.
We have tried to adapt block chains to different situations and we have learned a lot, but technology is not yet so advanced as to solve such problems."
Until then, the group said that it would focus more on trying to understand the nature of these obstacles.
They try to understand how to calculate physical objects, such as works of art, the value of chips or use block chains in the supply chain.
"As far as this is not at the centre of attention, but I think it will finally take an interest," Chase said.
Fidelity will be ready for that."
As an example, she pointed out the Pebble newspaper, which was completely unsuccessful in its trading standards, but finally bought Fidelity.
Its group created a programme for a smart clock, which was stopped after three years, when millions were collected through the Kickstarter Concentrate Funding Project.
The Apple Watch, Fidelity, was ready for the market.
It quickly applied the Pebble software to the new Apple product.
"We were not blind to the fact that the Pebble newspaper would be popular, but we wanted to be ready if people liked smart watches," she said.
"We collected knowledge and were ready when smart watches were released into the mass market."
Earthquakes and tsunamis devastated the island
On Friday, September 29, Indonesia’s islands hit Sulavesi with a powerful earthquake of 7.5, causing tsunamis and killing nearly 400 people.
There are a number of injured people and the number of dead is expected to rise.
According to the representative of the Indonesian disaster management agency, electricity and communications are not affected, and it is therefore difficult to assess the damage in the city and in the nearby Dongal fishing community.
Students in California wear masks with racist labels
As reported by the CNN branch of KGTV, this week, Escondido Schools Union confirmed that about 10 students had taken a badly-intentioned decision to demonstrate racism at the senior class event.
"We are proud that everyone in our school is being accepted and not afraid of diversity," said Adriana Lepe-Ramirez in the report.
"We will not tolerate the promotion of racism and exclusion."
The report also states that the incident is investigating Escondido's secondary school, union officials and local police.
"The school administrators have contacted the parents and guardians of adult students and will be subject to criminal penalties," the report says.
According to a report from the police station, students from the school north of San Diego wore masks with letters from which a racist note was written, and they were photographed by wearing it.
In general, the school approves records in advance, but when photographed officially, some students choose their own words.
The Union report states that such behaviour "is incompatible with the culture, values or history of the secondary school of Escondido".
"We must understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we make every day," said Lepe-Ramirez.
"Econdida's secondary school continues to be a culture based on family values and unity throughout the community."
The former teacher of Cade's Panel told the KGTV channel that the video that had been seen in the social media had corrupted him.
"It hurt me personally," he said.
“It seemed funny to them anyway, but it wasn’t.
Only fools can laugh at such things."
Heart surgery waiting for Shaquille O'Nealo son of Shareefas to miss the 1st UCLA season
Shaquille O'Nealo's son, Shareefas, a member of the basketball museum, will have to spend the first UCLA season due to heart failure.
According to TMZ Sports, O'Neal will have a heart surgery to remove the disorder observed by UCLA doctors during the usual examination.
"Thank God UCLA doctors have noticed the problem before," said O'Nealas TMZ.
“As rehabilitation takes place, I will attend lectures and I will be a normal student.
I'll be back very soon."
O'Nealas signed an official intentional protocol on August, promising to play on the UCLA team, which has already attracted not one name and is one of the best leading teams in the 2018-2019 season.
"Sharefas has improved significantly in high school," said Professor Steve Alford to reporters last month.
“He is a high-level, skilled, athletic and will be a great member of the new team.
We enjoy the composition of this year's team and shareefs will complement it perfectly.
It has a good basis and will be able to improve at both ends of the square."
According to "247Sports", at the age of 18, O'Nealas is a 4 star candidate, in 2018, with 8 seats as a heavy country shooter and 41 seats as a player.
Before joining UCLA, O'Neala's last season helped the high school crossroads achieve a record score – 25:9.
Sarah's Palin's eldest son is charged with violence against his father
The track was taken for three offenses, including an attack.
On Sunday, he wasn't taken for family violence for the first time.
According to court records, the incident occurred at the Palinian house in Vasilo, in Alias, where Track Palinas to the blood injured his father, Todd, who was in a car crash.
The 28-year-old was arrested after a Saturday incident for three offenses, including an attack.
The court documents indicate that the dispute began when the man called to take the truck, but the father refused to give it to him.
As explained in the court's statement, Track Palinas was arrested for instigating the first-degree charges and for assaulting the fourth grade and for criminal offence of the fourth grade, and his father was injured in the face and head.
On the basis of the documents, Palinas, the policemen who spoke to him, drew him out as a "prosperity" and told him not to use weapons.
The court's statement also states that the man was on the roof of the garage before being arrested.
The court documents include Sarah Palin’s words that her sons were “serious” and“used some medicine”.
It is also noted that Track Palin has told the police that a few bottles of beer had been used before.
He was arrested in early 2016 and accused of domestic violence against women, preventing him from reporting domestic violence and the possession of arms.
"Seeing how my son feels about what he is experiencing when he comes back, I understand the other families that are experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress, and I know how the soldiers are being hurt again," said the former Republican candidate to Vice President and the Governor of Alaska.
"Now better than ever, I understand that America's best needs a leader who will respect and value them."
Elizabeth Warren said he was thinking about candidate to the President after the mid-term election
"The time for women to go to Washington and correct the corrupt government to which a woman should be led," said the senator of the Democrats, speaking of the speeches gathered at the Holocaust.
"So I promise you: after 6 November, I will think carefully about whether it is not appropriate to apply to the presidents."
Warren, trying to defend his position in the race with a Republican representative in the country of Geoffu Diehlu, said earlier that I would not wait for the presidents because he wanted to pay attention to the work of the Senate.
"It is very important to focus on mid-term elections and to stop acting as if the only important thing would be 2020," she told reporters in August in a speech at the National Press Club.
"The closest important fight is mid-term elections, and they are important not only in Massachusetts, but also throughout the country."
Warren has long been regarded as a potential candidate for the 2020 democratic candidate to compete with President Donald Trump.
However, it would be looking forward to the difficult struggle of the early elections, which may involve other well-known Democrats – former Vice President Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.
The third fatality associated with mental illness in less than a year
According to The Mail, a third person had been murdered in a luxury psychiatric clinic for years.
On 7 April, Shaquelle Vidal (23rd) died of a television show, having spent almost a month volunteering in West London, Marylebon, in the Nightingale hospital.
Her boyfriend James Lyle (57) – the manager of the Risk Insurance Fund, millionaires and former supporter of the Conservative Party – paid her maintenance costs for five years.
The future chief cook died almost six months ago, when the high priest's title Daisy Boyd (28th) was launched by Rose Gray, one of the founders of River Cafe.
D. Boyd died of cancer on 5 October, after his divorce with the successor Dana Macmillan (43) of the publishing company, who was illegally introduced by a clinic visitor.
Two months ago, the artist Alan MacDonald (61) left the filming grounds when he was released from the hospital four days ago.
In May, the Supervisory Quality Commission criticised Nightingale's clinic because it did not try enough to prevent the introduction of illegal substances.
The comics of the BBC "Mock The Week" were registered at Avos Vidal daughter Shaquelle's clinic on 11 March.
Last week, at a preliminary session of the Westminster Crown Court, Queen Advocate Katie Gollop said that Shaquelle disappeared from AWOL on 29 March and returned to an understanding of the mental state after the week.
Mr. Gollop, acting on behalf of Avos Vidal, said: "My client wants to find out what happened to Shaquelle, what she was communicating with and what she was doing."
Ms. Lyle called Shaquelle "a curse".
“I know that Shaquelle continued to communicate with James Lyle and he was in New York at the time.”
At the Gordillo meeting, he revealed that Shaquelle called him on 4 April and said that he wanted to buy and drink cyanide and 20 minutes after this call "more than a dozen times", but no one responded.
"I guess further events could have been avoided if anyone had responded," he added.
On 5 April, the clinician concluded that Shaquelle’s mental condition is extremely poor.”
After less than 48 hours, she went off on a flight computer.
The representative of Nightingale expressed sympathy for the families and friends and said: "Our clinical objective is to provide high quality care in the safe, treatment in a favourable environment."

"Led Zeppelin" is again brought before the court on the allegedly stolen Stairway To Heaven guitar reef
"Led Zeppelin" was again brought before the court on the occasion of the "Starway To Heaven" song in 1971, which the group allegedly stole.
It is said that part of the British group's 1971 hits have been depleted.
The Court rejected the 2016 judgment that the group did not take the name of the other group Spirit.
In 2015, Michael Skidmore's trusted guitarist presented the claim.
It seems that the performance of the Led Zeppelin song "Starway to Heaven" will take a long time – as it does.
The group will again stand before the Court of Justice on charges against the 1971 Balady Guitar Rif.
The US Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 judgment that the group did not copy the hit from the start of the Spirit group.
The judge is alleged to have made mistakes, such as misinformation about copyright laws.
It was returned to the court.
Spiritist Randy Wolfe’s trusted Michael Skidmore’s first claim was filed in 2015.
Police robbery ended in Michigan when a policeman took a shot at a suspected killer.
The alleged population of Michigan in the murder of his girlfriend was captured after police raids, which ended up passing him to the police car.
Adam Nolin is believed to have killed his girlfriend in Vajomingen on Thursday in Michigan in the year 33 C.E.
He was taken to the court on Friday at the hospital where he arrived at the officer when he was transferred by police car to the SUV because Nolin shot policemen trying to escape on the road in which he was traveling intensively.
Nolinas has been convicted of five serious crimes, including an attack on murder and an escape from the police.
"The appeal to the court in the hospital is not normal, but this is not the first case," said Captain James Maguffee of the Wyoming Police.
‘The appropriate treatment applies, but the process of justice must also continue.
Judges often adapt to this effect."
Nolin's girl's body is found on Thursday in a mobile home in the Creekside Estates area.
The mother of two children was shot with one bullet, and the police immediately found Nolina a suspect.
The police then issued a public warning about Nolin and presented a brief description of the man and his 1996 black Dodge.
The man was spotted in his pocket and went to the speed of US 131 when the police tried to stop him.
Nolin and Picapapu came down to the concrete wall, then jumped out of the car and let them run fast.
As he ran away, he shot the trusted policemen.
One policeman sat in the police car and took Nolina from behind.
The observer filmed the event.
Nolina was taken to a hospital with severe but stable conditions and will remain there until she was released and transferred to Kent County Prison.
"This event showed that West Michigan policemen are risking their health in order to protect the community," said Maguffee.
"They took the man quite quickly and with appropriate measures, and we are very proud of them."
Nolin has been charged with a total of two charges for murder, he is also accused of being a fugitive from the police, of carrying a hidden weapon and of a serious crime committed in the use of a shooting weapon.
He's still innocent of his girlfriend's murder because there's no investigation.
"We are, of course, carrying out an ongoing murder investigation, which we will soon finish so that we can report it to the Prosecutor of Kent County," Maguffee said.
The judge praised the courageous man who threw his teeth into his house for the thief who had been robbed.
The judge had no pity for the courageous man who stood before two criminals who tried to break into his house.
Although one of the boys tried to drive him on a wooden board, at 63 C.E., David Oldham did not hesitate.
A man working in the university’s territory defended, beat both criminals, and brushed one of their teeth.
The rebels fled, but after a mustache on Mr. Oldham's blood was left, according to which Craig Ford was found and arrested after four months.
In announcing his judgment to Ford, who lost his teeth trying to enter the house of Oldham’s 400,000 pounds of individual value in Ormskerke, Lankašyra, the Royal Judge Clement Goldstone said: “You probably didn’t believe such a reaction of Oldham’s – when you were trapped to see only the eyes and nose, you met him at home, he broke you.
He also beat your partner, who tried to break into the second floor and jump off the roof.
On Friday, when Ford was sentenced to three years and four months in prison, the judge said: “I hope you have learned two lessons.
The first is not to excite David Oldham, the second is not to start with the police.
Because of your crimes, you now have one tooth less than before and you have a dog.
It's a small penalty."
He added: “I want to congratulate Mr Oldham on how he responded to your actions.”
Prosecutor Derek Jones said that Ford had already been sentenced to another entry in 2016 and had to be sentenced for three years, but had been released on an equal footing.
Mr Oldhams appealed to the Royal Court of Liverpool when he heard a noise at home on 5 April at about 19.00 a.m.
“ Mr. Oldham, who is in charge of a man, went out of the house and courageously objected to the charges against him.
Fearing for his safety, he struck him in the face, tearing him in pieces and throwing his teeth.
Then the other intruder jumped out of the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctively smashed his face."
According to Mr. Jones, the minister took a wooden board and tried to drive to Oldham, and Ford said: “Kill him, he has thrown my teeth away.”
The co-founder told Oldham, "If you let us go," and he and Ford escaped from the crime scene.
On August 2nd, the police held Ford on a trip to the Wavertree area.
Ford asked the police dog, and then this guy's got him on his heels.
It's supposed to be a second break-in still open.
Fordas admitted his guilt for breaking in, killing and dangerous driving, although this was forbidden to him and he did not have a driver's license.
The criticism of such activists made to Johnson came with applause.
These activists today buried Boris Johnson when he was evicted with “a dark and aggressive man”.
P Johnson, trying to convince ordinary people in his compromises about Brexit, called for a strong assessment by former Minister of Trade Digby Jones, who was also in favour of the Birmingham conference this afternoon.
David David also attacked Mr. Johnson because he was concerned about the headlines, not about strong politics.
Speaking to MailOnline, the union member in the Cabinet of Ministers added that he was simply "crazy" because he could not be a full-fledged leader.
The opposition was called upon when the former Foreign Secretary re-attached the Minister's "Chequers" plan and called it "unreasonable" and "totally absurd".
Mr Johnson also added that he sincerely believed in the project, and that is what she rejected two years ago in the referendum.
He also called on the government to support ambitious projects such as the bridge between the construction of Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May rejected her criticism of political games and claimed that she was not bluffing and prepared for difficult negotiations with the EU.
In an interview with Andrew Marro BBC, which started their conference, Mr. May said, "I believe in Brexit."
The former Lebanese Trade Minister, Lord Jones, now acting independently, has received prior consent to hear Brexit's perspective.
People were pleased when he expressed his opinion on Mr Johnson, who had apparently responded to the questions of the concerned businessmen.
In particular, without mentioning Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones allowed him to understand that he is “a poor and aggressive man. ”
"The business is very important, therefore, by saying 'velniop business', the former secretary of foreign affairs showed that he is really a poor and aggressive man," he said.
"I totally disagree with him."
Lord Jones also welcomed the response of Mr May to the Zalcburg leaders at the meeting of the EU leaders to her cabinet plan.
Scotland’s leader Ruth Davidson also once criticized Mr Johnson, reminding him that he was a high-ranking government official during the Brexit negotiations.
Mr May, in the Cabinet of Ministers, Mr MailOnline said that the intervention is not very serious and Mr Johnson does not have enough support between Parliament to be able to avoid the Prime Minister.
They said: “Now such news is not very dangerous.
He's noisy, but he doesn't have enough support in the parliamentary party, and he knows that himself.
We see the sharp contrast between David Davis, who respectfully expressed his opinion, and Boris, meeting his personal ambitions."
Business Secretary Greg Clarks criticized Mr Johnson, who attacked the businessmen who were skeptically looking at Brexit.
Speaking at a similar conference in Birmingham, Mr. Clarks said that Mr. Johnson was "full of injustice".
He said: “It’s amazing that someone in general can think that way.
There is no successful economy in the world that does not have successful flourishing companies."
In an interview with the Ridge on Sunday, Mr. Davis acknowledged that the coming months will not be easy, as the EU will try to force the United Kingdom to give a lot of advantages.
However, he believes that the government must not compromise and reach a similar agreement to the Canadian Treaty, rather than the one proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers.
When asked how Mr. Johnson managed to lead the towers, he did not miss the opportunity to hire the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
With Mr Johnson's proposal to bridge the bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: "One of the British policy's shortcomings is the policy of fantastic ideas."
He added: "Our communication is chaotic, and many of his ideas are suitable for titles, but not for strong politics."
Bulgaria spent 80 million £ European taxpayers' money on poor restaurants
Bulgaria has released £80 million of European taxpayers' money to a poor old castle restaurant, which now appears to be built from "silver and cardboard".
The Balkan countries have released £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning to the previous size, the restaurant got used to it.
The local authorities of the sites of the Krakra fortress have promised to carry out an incredible operation.
The Bulgarian government has released ten million EUs for a non-cash medieval castle restaurant.
The Balkan country has released £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund for the restoration of old castles and fortresses, but instead of returning their previous size, it has gained experience in building works.
The relics that have fallen after expensive reconstructions seem to be built from "sur and cardboard", therefore no longer attractive to tourists.
For example, the memorialists found that the fortress of the Middle Ages of the western city of Pernik in Bulgaria, Krakra and the Roman fort Trayanov Vrata, near Ihtimano, was reconstructed using polymer concrete, most commonly used as a basis.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian government have privately agreed that this failure should be learned.
"The fortress is a closed state," said the architect and memorial guard Stella Duleva about Trayanov Vrata.
It lasted for 16 centuries, and now it's damaged."
Such reactions were received after the restaurant in Pernik Krakra fort, and the local government promised to remove the part delivered in 2019.
The pernicium fortress, due to unexpected modifications, has been removed from the carton.
The Byzantine Yailata fort is designed in a "silver of cheese" because it was rebuilt from the smooth white blocks that are not attached to the face of the air.
These unsuccessful efforts coincide with new doubts about how the European Union is using the development funds.
Stylish men's mini at this year's "Distinguisshed Gentlemen's Ride" event
These stylish costumed motorcyclists from all over the United Kingdom went to the streets on vintage motorcycles to collect money for the Movember fund.
The event is called the "Kilnaus Jäntelmen's trip" and is organised annually to collect money and raise public awareness of prostate cancer.
This year the barbarians market in London and elsewhere in the UK in 40, including Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
This year's events "Distinguisshed Gentleman's Ride" take place in the United Kingdom and 650 other cities of the world and have so far managed to collect more than $5.5 million (£4.2 million).
The official event website says that this year, 120,000 people “have shown up on their necks, face up to their necks, matched the tuition costumes, sat on their classic and vintage motorcycles and allowed to collect money and raise awareness of men’s health, namely prostate cancer and men’s mental health”.
In Sydney, for the first time in Australia, Mark Hawk has organized the "Distinguisshed Gentleman's Ride" event.
The idea was inspired by a picture of Dono Draperio’s performance in the series “Mad Men” in which he sat on the classic motorcycle with the best in his line.
This year, hundreds of barbers, including the dog of the tax breed named Sergeant Piper, were riding at the Tower Bridge in London.
Dennis axis Boris Beckeris was exposed to skin cancer treatment
Boris Becker thanked the doctors who successfully removed skin cancer.
Becker’s pictures are just a small patch to the sun’s eyelids.
"It was an ordinary check and seemed less than it really is," he told the German newspaper.
When it was discovered that it was treated with skin cancer, the tennis legend Boris Beckeris was photographed with a patch on his nose.
On Wednesday he published a message in German on Twitter about his health: "I want to thank Martini Mayr-Brune and Dr. Kati Maier from Munich who managed to cure me."
On Sunday in pictures of the 50th year, a small patch is visible to the eyes from the sun.
"I visited a dermatologist on the morning that removed me from basic cell carcinoma," Beckeris told the German magazine Image.
"It was an ordinary check and it seems less than it really is."
Base cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer in 75% of cases.
When time is set, there is a great chance of success.
Becker is currently different from Lilly Becker's wife (42nd) and they reported divorces in May.
The tennis star has won six important awards in the unit contests, 13 "Masters Series" titles and the Olympic gold medal in a double match.
He's recently noticed having fun with his friends at the 185th Octoberfest Munich.
A 24-year-old bullet sealed on an unknown train platform caused by the body’s volume
On the train platform, the unidentified naked British athlete decided not to pay attention.
Jessica Mayho, who won the silver medal this year at the British athletes’ championship, said he was robbed on Friday afternoon at Lids station.
At the age of 24 and five, 11 inches [11 cm] in height, Mr. Mayho said that he was forced to wait for the train and that he was bitten by words.
At about 5:00 p.m., a man who was attacked took her “large ” off the platform.
The rising sports star, however, was fired by the man in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on the site of the British team.
From West York City, Father Mayho said: “I’ve died before other people lost their eyes on the full - time platform.
Such people can be intimidated and forced to trust themselves no longer, but it is the MANO body, the MANO "mechanism".
After reporting on his adventure on Twitter, the young athlete called for a great deal of support in the social media.
MBE ordered the knight Andy's Lewis wrote: “Stora!!!
Maybe he's drunk with the blind?
It's crazy, Jesse, it's all right with you.
Don't let that idiot ruin your mood."
Gavin Gray added: "I'm crazy.
Not only because of him, but also because of the circumstances that ignored him.
I'm glad you're okay.
You're an example of a new generation.
You show that you need to be proud of yourself, and you can relax when you're not satisfied!"
At the University of Lids, he was interested in adolescence at the age of the Mayho Corps and was encouraged by one of her senior nurses.
Since then, she has been able to take the second place at the British Müller's Seniors Championship, which took place in Birmingham in July this year.
She won the British Championship medal just a month after winning the North England Games.
He refused to comment further on the event.
Once the account of at least 50 million users is broken, Facebook will have to pay £1.25 billion.
Using a security gap, criminals could reach at least 50 million Facebook accounts.
However, a large break-in was only reported on Friday after three days.
Now Facebook under the new European Data Laws threatens a huge penalty
With a discount of at least 50 million, Facebook may pay a fine of £1.25 billion.
The criminals were able to obtain a security breach account, so much personal information could be disclosed.
However, Facebook only reported the entry on Friday three days ago, and it was not possible to tell how many British bills were damaged until yesterday.
As the search for the programmers continues, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who checks how the Internet giant complies with the requirements of European data compliance, has criticised the company after its headquarters in Dublin, saying: "The report is incomplete."
Facebook, under the new European Union data law, is a major penalty because companies may be required to pay up to four percent of the world turnover.
In the past year, Facebook earned £31.2 billion.
The criminals have reached the account using the Facebook function View as allowing users to see how their profiles appear to others.

The following records are heard in the MG Baltic case: the defendants have consulted the Gabrieli Landsberg
The hearing was opened in November 2015 between the interview of former Vice-President Raymond Kurlianski and the former "worker" of Vytautas Gapši.
Listening to the record makes it difficult to understand exactly what people are currently talking about.
True, the record says that R. Kurlianskis and V. Gapšys talk about Christmas, several times calls the name of the current conservative leader Gabrieliaus Landsbergi, but what exactly is being said is difficult to understand.
Penalties for both natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, charges are brought to three legal and five natural persons: the Working Party and the Liberals, the Group of Liberals and Liberals, the former Liberal and Labour Leaders, Masiuli, Vytaut Gapsi, the former Liberal, Mr Gustaini, Mr Seimas, Mr Steponaviči and the former Vice-President, Mr Kurlianski.
Interested parties are suspected of having an impact on the trade and trade, the Liberal conflict is suspected of having an impact on the trade, trade and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of having an impact on the acquisition and trade of these parties.
The officials suspect that the politicians took or spoke about the clashes with MG Baltic Vice-President Kurlianski, then proposed or supported the Group's initiatives in the Seim and other institutions.
The former President of the Liberal Consensus, Mr Masuilis, is suspected of the effect of trade, harassment and illegal enrichment, the former vice-president of this party, Mr Steponaviči, and the former member of the Vilnius City Council, Mr Gustaini, who was slandered.
V. Gapšys is suspected of the effects of counterfeiting and trade, Mr Kurlianskis - of the effects of paper and trade.
Question: Who has the greatest chance of winning the second presidential election?
In the poll on the second round of elections, four candidates from the top of the ranking were included - economist Gitan Nauseda, the unpublished minister of the president Saulius Skvernelis and two of the family members of the Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LCD) party - Seimo Member Ingrid Šimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Ushakas.
True, on Sunday it turned out that the TS-LCD had received support in the elections, I. Šimonytė, and V. Usackas withdrew from the election struggle.
As data show, if the elections were to take place in the near future, in all cases the second presidential tour would win Mr Nauseda, but the leader of the "Vilmorus", sociologist Vladas Gaidys said that it is too early to draw conclusions.
"Separate (from others - DELFI) Naused, but it is very important to watch whether the parties are talking or about people who are dynamic.
These were the doubles of Shimonyta from one study to the other, and Nauseda had stopped growing, and Usacka had even decreased.
This growth is very important to you," says the sociologist.
Moreover, in view of the results of the survey, it is clear that a large percentage of people have not yet decided what they will vote for or think generally against the elections.
If the second presidential election were to be held by I. Šimonytė and S. Skvernelis, the fight would be waged - for I. Šimonytė would vote 32.7%, for S. Skvernelė 30.9%.
True, even 36.4 per cent of the people replied that they would not vote for any of these candidates, or they did not know who would vote for, or refuse to vote.
Sociologist V. Gaidys once again stressed that until now we have seen not a full picture, because all the candidates who would apply to the less successful Lithuanian electorate have not yet been announced.
"If we looked at last year's elections, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where's the candidate for Social Democrats?
When he preaches, he will see how his opportunities are influenced by other candidates.
So that side of Lithuania, which is less successful until it is less reflected," said V. Gaidys.
Politologist Majvydas Jastramski, a political scientist at Vilnius University of International Relations and Political Sciences (UU TSPMI), says that the conclusions are still very early, and all three candidates, who have been rejected after the fight with V. Ushaka, seem to have been surrounded.
"I can say from my research experience that these differences do not mean anything.
The difference between 5 percentage points does not really show any candidate's advantage.
The only thing I could see was that Nauseda would look good against Ushaka again, if those people were to come to a real vote.
Nauseda v Skvernela also looks good, but we now compare apples and potatoes because, for example, Nauseda has already announced that he will participate, Skvernelis has not been published.
In addition, the poll took place before the first conservative election, how would it look after them?" - says a polytologist.
According to him, Mr. Nauseda has a little extra, but when all the candidates are announced, he may be able to attend.
"The situation is quite the same.
Naused, Skvernelis, Shimonytė - the results are approximate.
I would like to remind you that after half a year before the 2003 presidential election, Roland Paks had 5% support to vote for it and then won the election.
It is impossible to make any predictions," said Mr Jastramski.
DELFI recalls that in the presidential elections candidates have already been announced by economist G. Nauseda, Seimas Member I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist, Seimas Member Aušra Maldeikienė, member of the Liberal Consensus Peter Austrevičius, Seimas Member Naglis Pudakis and member of the European Parliament Valentinas Mazuronis.
Iran blames Israel for attempting to set up a cyberattack
"The regime whose use of cyber weapons history is clear from such cases as (computer virus) Stuxnet (disclosure), this time tried to damage Iran's communications infrastructure," wrote Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jéromi on Twitter.
He had in mind the attack of the Stuuxnet virus in 2010, which caused damage to Iran's nuclear facilities.
It is believed that this harmful program was created by Israel and the United States.
"Because of our technical teams' wake up, they left their hands empty.
We will continue to talk about this counter-action in international forums," Mr J. A. Jéromi stressed.
Deputy Minister Hamidas Fatthai said that during the days of the technical team on Monday, many attempts were made to interfere with their systems, but the attackers were "a strong retreat".
In the health club Impuls, the man did a bad thing, failed to recover it
The accident occurred about 10.40 a.m.
Suddenly, in 1945, a swimming man in the pool suddenly fell ill, and he panicked under the water.
The man was quickly taken out of the water, but he was already unconscious.
It was tried to catch him.
Soon thereafter, the emergency doctor tried to rescue him, but he was unable to save his life.
He died on his way back to the hospital in the car.
Antan Sakalausk, leader of the Health Club Network Impuls.
"We have reported that a 73-year-old man visited our health club, Fabionskyi, with his wife on Monday morning.
The Basseine client flew for about 30 minutes, then came up to the pool trails to rest and then suddenly fell after a few minutes.
The party of the former people - the client who was swimming in the joint road and the pool supervisor - responded immediately, pulled him out of the water and began to grow.
The man was constantly being hunted until he arrived early.
The club staff immediately called for rapid medical assistance, which arrived within 5 minutes.
When the doctor arrived, he restored the man’s pulse and breathing and moved him to a medical car.
While in the hospital, the doctors tried to stabilize the condition of the man, unfortunately, after 20 minutes we received information that the man had not survived.
We mean a heartfelt sense of loss to the dead man’s family.
According to the original data, the accident could lead to a client’s health problem.
According to the information provided to family physicians, he has diabetes.
We note that in the face of serious health problems, it is always important to be responsible for assessing your options and to consult doctors and health club specialists.
All health clubs in the pool premises are an awake supervisor whose main task is to monitor the pool, its access and ensure the safety of customers, it distinguishes clearly from other employees.
Such pool supervisors shall have radio stations that can contact the administration and registry immediately, respond to their requests or request for assistance.
Four times a year, staff training on the security programme takes place - much more often than required by laws.
During this period, staff shall increase their theoretical and practical knowledge, learn how to behave in the event of an accident, be monitored or employees shall properly comply with the rules of procedure and internal procedures.
How Portugal has radically solved the problem of heroin

In Norway, the son is missing Beauty: he has changed even four families and no longer speaks Lithuanian
According to the LNK press report, Lithuania lost the right to raise children four years ago and to see them in the decision of the Norwegian Children's Rights Service, Barnevernet, and the courts.
A woman’s story led to an international scandal that followed the entire media.
The national points for the return of the boy to Lithuania were prepared for his mother both in Lithuania and in Norway.
However, the public did not help Gražinai and her family to return to their son, who is of Lithuanian nationality.
Today, a woman relates how she has lived for the past few years apart from her son and how she and her child meet after two years of breakup.
At the time of the loss of the right to care for the sons, the boy was 8th, today the 12th, the beginning of adolescence.
For the first two years, she had never seen a son, which was forbidden.
Later, she was granted the right to see her son twice a year, just one hour later.
The last, a few months ago, the number of sights for Lithuania was increased to three times a year and extended to two hours.
Meetings with the son each time remind us of the sights in the hard-haired prison - observing officers and going to them - a secret operation.
"The son has changed even four families and no longer speaks Lithuanian," - this Tuesday evening opens Beauty, her story - in the LNK game
Eligius Masuli will not be returned to the sum of the personal money taken through the mine
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal declared that the defendant’s complaint was rejected.
The decision is final and shall not be appealed.
In the case of political corruption, the former Head of the Liberal Consensus, E. Masuilis, appealed to the Court of Appeal, asking him to pay back some personal money - the money taken from him and the wife's money - over and over.
A total of more than EUR 242 000 was taken from E. Masulio.
Such money shall be subject to a temporary restriction on ownership and shall be continuously extended.
The last time the Vilnius District Court extended it on 15 October.
E. Masuilis did not ask the Court of Appeal to repay all the money - he seeks to recover from the marriage money taken 800 euros and its money - 690 euros, 130 UK pounds sterling, 1600 US dollars.
Former policy states that the last money was allocated to the US planned trip.
E. Masiulio's lawyer Mindaugas Bleuvas asked the Court of Appeal to repay the money on Monday, because the spouses worked well and had the opportunity to have such amounts.
Prosecutor Justas Laucius asked the court to dismiss the complaint.
"The judgment of the Voluntary District Court is lawful and justified and no longer limited to the assets specified in the charges lodged.
The Court rightly found that there are grounds for confiscation of assets, as well as for confiscation of extended assets," Mr Laucius said at the hearing.
On 15 October, the Vilnius District Court decided not to repay more than 242,000 euros in the case of political corruption to E. Masuili.
These money can be found through the gross corruption of the past in the home and in the car.
The panel of three judges found that the substance of the case shows that ownership rights are limited only to funds that constitute a subject of criminal offences committed to E. Masuili.
"In view of the extent of the limitation, it is concluded that the right of the defendant's property is not restricted disproportionately or that the restriction applies too long," - says Judges Nijolie Zimkieni, Jurgitis Kolyčienės and Fire Trumpet.
The Judges noted that in Case E. Masuulis is accused of committing serious crimes, the criminal case is large and complex and therefore it is necessary to extend the period of limitation of the defendant's property in order to ensure possible confiscation of property and the extension of the confiscation of property.
The prosecutors claim that the former Vice President of the MG Baltic Group, Raymond Kurlianskis, has given E. Masiuli a EUR 106 000 kiss for the group's decision-making.
Both defendants believe that E. Masiul's money - 90 thousand euros - was the Kurlianski loan.
According to the case, E. Masiúl is found 242.4 thousand euros, 130 UK pounds sterling and 1.6 thousand US dollars.
E. Masuili and his lawyer have repeatedly tried to recover money, but the courts have rejected their requests.
Former policies have said that part of these funds belongs to other persons and was intended to invest in real estate or is his family's money.
He also claimed that there was no evidence that the funds were obtained in a criminal way.
Previously, the Court of Appeal has announced that E. Masuili's charges could be seen that these funds could be received by receiving more than EUR 100 thousand.
Legal protection claims that the balance of cash taken through the mine could have been obtained from undetermined sources of income, undeclared, unconfirmed documents, and perhaps no legitimate income.
In the case of political corruption, charges are brought to three legal persons - the Labour Party, the Liberals, the group "MG Baltic".
In addition to E. Masiulio, the case brought charges to the former "worker" Vytaut Gapši, the former liberal parliamentary Charuna Gustaini, the Seimas member Gintar Steponavichi and the former MG Baltic Vice President, R. Kurlianski.
Mr Kurlianski is accused of having given the former parliamentarians Masulia, Mr Gustaini and Mr Gapsi a fine.
The Americans recorded dangerous Russian destroyers
During the 25-minute take-off, according to U.S. Navy forces, the Russian SU-27 rushed directly through the plane.
The Russian plane went through it for the second time, using the train speed, and made an effort with a tail.
The passengers reported turbulence during the first approach and the shock during the second approach.
The Russian army has the right to practice in international airspace, but this interaction was irresponsible.
We expect international standards that ensure security and prevent incidents consistent with behaviour, including the 1972 Agreement on Sea Accidents and the Prevention of the Sea (INCSEA), - the US military forces said in their report.
"Unsafety actions increase the risk of miscalculation and potential conflicts", notes the report.
The Russian Defence Ministry acknowledged the incident, but believed that the Russian U.S.-27 respected the "safe distance" from the US aircraft.
The cost of parenting continues to decline: for pre-employment only up to 50 euros a month
According to a survey conducted by the market and public opinion research company "Baltic Studies", a survey carried out at the end of August revealed that a third (32%) of parents of their one-school child 's purchase' was less than 100 euros this year, a fifth (21%) was released from 101 to 150 euros, three out of ten (29%) from 151 to 200 euros, and less than a fifth (18%) was spent at the end of the summer by the school.
The parents whose children started to go to the first grade in this year’s school year gave their child’s school basket an average of about 220 euros, while the other parents, who had already completed the first grade, gave their child’s preparation a reduced amount of about 160 euros on average.
However, there is a lack of spending on escape for the years of science, since parents often have to raise money for their children’s beards and corpetors.
Depending on the nature of the occupation, the price of one barrel in the country may vary from EUR 20 to 100.
Parents who have children of school age were asked to tell the average amount they plan to spend each month on their one child’s special job.
A quarter (23%) of the child surveyed planned to spend up to 20 euros per month, a quarter (26%) claimed to have paid up to 50 euros, three out of ten (31%) allocated to the child's professional employment from 50 to 100 euros per month, and a sixth (17%) of parents indicated that they planned to spend 100 euros or more.
True, in Lithuania, children of school age are given an informal child education basket, which consists of 15 euros a month.
However, these money can be used only for one ticket, and if the employment price is higher, the difference must be covered by the parents.
In the case of children aged in school, if the child attends a couple of bars or if the family grows a few children, the expenses of the family activities may be doubled.
According to the marketing manager of the consumer loan company Vivus.lt Justin Ambrasienė, small or medium-income families can save children's beards, especially when a few children are growing up in the family, can become a little challenge.
When you start school, your parents turn their heads around, where you get money for your training, office goods, or new sports clothes.
Now the main concern is how to hire children after school without leaving that burden money.
We note that the expenditure of parents is particularly increasing in August when it is necessary to prepare properly for new years of science, but later it remains higher than in the summer, because parents are willing to invest in their savings.
Often, because of a lack of money and a responsible assessment of their options, they are determined and lent," says J. Ambrasia.

The Kaunas enjoys a fourth of the broken trolleybus
Today, the fourth exhibition of the mobile street "Atia old, good news" has already appeared on Kaunas Street - a drawing and inscription "Sienograph locks" of the old trolleybus.
The municipality of Kaunas reported on the new happy trolleybus.

Not a week after the first appearance on Kaunas Street, the second street artist Timothy Norvila - Morfai was born.
A yellow car on the trolebus, which is often referred to as a mere "vabalu".
"I wanted to invite the trolleybus.
This drawing looks very nice, especially because it matches the trolleybus wheels.
When you turn on your wheels, it looks like it's part of the car.
When we painted the wheels white, we made them look like a retro-style, it really hurt the whole combination.
Until the trolleybus tyres were painted, it certainly didn't seem so funny," - as far as the portal kaunas.daina.lt spoke street artist.
On 27 October, the painting was laid on the third trolleybus.
It is frozen with white, yellow, orange, red, but mostly blue.
This color is dominant.
On the left side of the trolleybus body, there is one K.Donelaichi's house, on the right - central post.
"Wabalas" to the best of me," - Morfai asked for the third trolleybus to be deprived of the artist Morfai.

New ground-based modern trolleys will have more seats, efficient room conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver's workplace.
New technology and parallel repairs to the contact network and road repair will allow trolleys to drive more safely, much faster.
And, of course, modern design trolleybuses are very beautiful in the city," said Mindaugas Grigeli, Director General of Kaunas Bus.
The first new trolleybuses in Kaunas will reach August next year, and all old trolleybuses will be replaced by December.

The invitation to celebrate Christmas together, in addition, has changed the language of D. Ragland's plan for a longer public in the United Kingdom.
It is played that she wants to help her daughters before and after her birth.
Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, should be born first in the spring of 2019.
In the "Zalgirio" arena and again the wormhole shows "Women's World"
After entering the autumn routine and the brighter weather, the 16th show "Women World" is already being prepared - women announce the long weekend because even four days of hottest fashion, style and beauty news is already here - November 8-11, Kaunas in the Zalgirio Arena.
Over the course of the year, to see how the face of the event changes, the exhibition means not a linear purchase, but a tradition of giving time to itself.
Often it becomes a place for friends and a cause for spending the day with a sister or a mother.
The four show days have special power - every woman here can learn the secrets of magic, learn to dress like the candles every day, find unaltered products, hear or test various procedures that inhibit the aging process of the skin.
All this and more, it promises even 415 exhibit participants who will be waiting for visitors at all three arenas.
Three days will take place on the subjects of beauty and health, and on Sunday, the representatives of the artistic sex will be able to hear the advice to create an exclusive image from the lips of the stylist and the writer of Victoria.
A large part of women who are involved in business are faced with marginal situations in which stress can interfere with a stable emotional and physical state.
For this reason Kaunas's Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Works and their Network of Business Women, the birth idea is to hold a conference "Versli and happy. Without stress", where discussions and practical examples will help you in challenging situations and encourage you to look at your life more creatively.
Like every year, the exhibition covers events for the teachers of beauty.
The exhibition's long-term partners, the Kirpėži and beauty specialists' association, will give you two days of learning hair coloring and modelling subtleties from the charismatic duo of the international Academy of Vinokurov & Friends - S. Maslov and R. Sakalausko.
In order to further improve the field of the introduction of the river, the competition and the skill struggle "Art Battle", which will not leave any doubt.
It's like a summer on the cake will become a festival of beautiful world representatives "With birthdays, Lithuania", in which the occasion of the century will be able to develop an unprecedented show - from body painting to dances.
Not to be forgotten is another tradition of Women's World - the presentation of the latest collections of designers on Friday's "Mads and Beauty Show", where you will choose the most stylish.
And handicrafts will be waiting in the creative workshops of "Dekostudies", where you can create original works for interiors or more interesting decoration gifts.
On the last day of the exhibition, in particular, all the longcases are expected, because traditional visitors will enjoy the "Long-Haired World Longfield World World World World 2018", where new longest case records are recorded each year.
Prime Minister: after the introduction of the state payment, the teacher's salary increased by EUR 117
Since September, the average remuneration of teachers in the country with a full workload has increased by 117 euros, according to Prime Minister Saulis Skvernelis.
"It is early to say how much she (new order - BNS) has advantages or weaknesses.
The fact is that those people who have a full workload - their salaries have grown more than 117 euros on average," S. Skvernelis told reporters in the government on Monday.
He called the "democracy right" to implement the plans of the professional union of Lithuanian education workers (SPDS) to strike a strike for national pay, but stressed that the strike should not interfere with the education process.
"All forms of protest in a democratic country are permitted, possible.
If you think you need to strike, it's their decision-making right.
You don't want to see your children hurt in this place again, scientists.
If the strike is to happen, it must be done in accordance with the laws in force," said S. Skvernelis.
In June, Seimas approved the model for the employment of state teachers, introducing it from September.
Teacher payment changed the hourly payment - the teacher’s status is 1512 hours a year.
The teacher’s working time is divided into three sections: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation for them and work for the community.
This reform, led by Andriaus Navicko, is called absurd, insulting the adoption of the "buldozer" principle and announcing an indefinite strike starting on November 12th.
The LSDPS requires that this "minutes" pay system be immediately removed and that a flat model be set up for up to a maximum of 18 contact hours for one stage.
Also, official wage rates are increasing 20% and reducing the number of children in classes.
In addition to other innovations, a new methodology for the allocation of training funds has been introduced, because, according to the union, there is insufficient funding for home training, for the sharing of classes into groups, qualifications, education aid, and for the high-class cities as it has been.
The Ministry of Education and Science has stated that the state-of-the-art teacher's work will help to regulate the workloads of teachers and to reward the school community for all the work.
It is envisaged that, at the level of the teacher, the work for the community will be up to half the number of hours per year, the first two years of work, up to 40% per hour.
It is determined that the teacher’s working hours per week are 36 hours, of which no more than 24 contact persons per week are required to teach the subject(s).
On May, the two-hour strike launched at the LSDPS contributed about half a hundred general education schools, vegetables and non-formal education institutions, about 1 thousand pedagogians.
There are about 53 thousand educators in Lithuania as a whole.
Invites to be prepared: crises can be expected within 2-3 years
The slowdown in economic growth and even crises can be expected in the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the Government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than decades ago, during an interview with the "Knowledge Radio" series, the "Business position" said by the Lithuanian Bank Board President Vitas Vasiliuskas.
"Saying that the crisis is already beyond the corner, I really couldn't, but there are really signs of economic slowdown.
This year our country's economy has grown by more than 3 per cent, and we are planning an increase of 2.8 per cent next year.
The main message I would like to say to the public and to the business - let's be ready for all," said Vasiliuskas.
In his view, there are no similar crises, so they need to be prepared differently.
The difference from the crisis that took place decades ago is that the government at that time believed that the income generated by the growing economy would be everlasting, and that was the result of the planned expenditure.
In 2008, therefore, after the crisis, the costs were greatly reduced.
Now, say Vassiliusko, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"It is true that the assessment of the situation of the Lithuanian Bank and the Ministry of Finance varies.
We believe that we are already beyond the potential and that we need to press the brakes.
At the same time, the Ministry of Finance doesn't like it," said the President of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
The preparation of the country's institutions for the upcoming crisis, V. Vasiliuskas, evaluates 7 out of 10 points.
According to him, a small and open economy, such as Lithuania, has a very strong external impact.
The current strangulation between the US, China and the European Union will undoubtedly strike us.
That is why we must be very careful.
When the economy is low to say that we decide everything, it is possible, but I do not believe it," said Vasiliuskas.
What lies ahead for those who have borrowed large sums of money?
According to Vasiliaus, the European Central Bank has clearly set up a short-term strategy, and interest-change solutions can be expected not earlier than the next summer: 'the main objective of this is to try to manage expectations'.
The trend, which is of the utmost concern to the head of the Lithuanian Bank, is the reduction of the labour force in our country.
"Employment of labour is, in part, leading to a reduction in the competitiveness of the economy.
Moreover, this is a reduction in the food supply.
This year's migration has allowed this process to be somewhat balanced, but it doesn't know if it's a long-term trend," my V. Vasiliuskas.
ELTA recalls that the Lithuanian Bank and the Ministry of Finance predict that the country's economy will grow by 3.4% this year, and that the next year it will be 2.8%.
Swedish Conservative leader again tries to form a government
On Monday, the President of Parliament announced Sweden, a conservative leader of the Contracting Party, two months after the elections, will have the second opportunity to form a government.
Ulfo Kristerson (Ulfo Kristerson) is owned by the right-wing Allian Group of the Four Centers, which received less votes during the September 9th election than the previous left-wing coalition.
The two blocs found it difficult to overcome the majority of refusals with the antiimigrace of the Swedish Democratic Party, which is the source of the neo-Nazi movement.
The first attempt by Mr. Kristersson to form a government on October 14 was unsuccessful.
On 29 October, the Minister, Mr Lofven (Stefan Lioven), who completed his term of office, announced his failure.
In an attempt to force the parties to agree, President Andreas Norlene said that next week he would propose to Parliament as a candidate for the Prime Minister, thus pushing the first vote since the government's efforts to form it began.
"It is not clear in advance whether the various parties will accept Ulf Kristersson as the prime minister," the reporters said to Mr Norlen.
However, he stressed that "the process must move forward and the dynamics between the parties must change".
"The inevitable negotiations must end," he added.
Parliament's voting date is not clear yet, but Mr Norlene said that the date is 14 November.
In Sweden, the President of Parliament may appoint one candidate four times to form a government to which Parliament would agree.
If all four tests are unsuccessful, the country must hold new elections.
The current appointment of Mr Kristersson is the third test of Mr Norlene.
Some of the Group of the Party of the Left and Alliance's Christian Democrats press U. Kristersson to accept the support of the Party of the Right of Sweden, but he has so far rejected such a possibility.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which received 17.6 per cent of the votes during the elections and is the third largest party, ignores the long term of the main race.
The ultra-secondary party, having successfully used the electoral anger of the voters in the elections after almost 400 thousand asylum seekers had arrived in the country since 2012, calls for an impact on the decision-making process.
However, the members of the Alliance of Liberals and Centralists are categorically opposed to such ideas.
Since 2014, the S. Lofven Social Democrats' Working Party (SAP) has been able to cooperate between the blocs, but only if it maintains the Prime Minister's position.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party rejected this opportunity.
A delegation of the Afghan Government to participate in peace negotiations in Russia
The delegation of the Government of Kabul will participate this month in international negotiations on the war of peace in Afghanistan, officials reported on Monday.
The Taliban is in its turn considering whether to participate.
On Saturday, Russia announced that it would hold such a conference in Moscow on 9 November, although the US is currently trying to establish bilateral negotiations with the Taliban on the end of a 17-year-old conflict.
The High Peace Council of the Government of Afghanistan, which is responsible for the efforts of combatants, will send four representatives to the meeting in Moscow, told the news agency AFP by representative Sayed Ihsan Taheri (Sajidas Ihsan Taheri).
However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan has failed to answer whether it will send its delegation to this conference, which will focus on the launch of peace negotiations between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still in agreement with Russia's officials, said the representative of Sebastian Ahmadi (Sebagtula Ahmadis). - We welcome any peace efforts led by Afghans.
The Taliban representative Zabiullah Mujajaid (Zabiula Mudjahid) said that the movement is still weighing on whether to go.
Moscow also invited representatives from the US, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet Central Asian republics.
Pakistan, formerly accused of supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan, "will necessarily participate", AFP said the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Muhammad Faisalas (Muhamadas Faisalas).
The US Embassy in Kabul has not yet responded to the request to comment.
The first meeting was scheduled in Moscow on September, but was postponed by the Kabului demanding that the Afghans lead the process.
The negotiations will take place at an early stage.
The newly appointed US envoy, Zalmay Khalilzadas (Zalmaius Khalilzadas) is trying to persuade the Taliban to agree to negotiate the end of the war and is anxious that a multilateral meeting in Russia could disrupt these efforts.
One week ago, the U.S. Government Supervisory Authority indicated that the Government of Kabul had weakened in recent months.
President of Cuba Pchenjane met with North Korean leader
North Korean leader Kim Jong Unas (Kim Chen Unas) and President of Cuba Miguel Diazas-Canelis (Migelis Dias-Canelis) who both opted for the abolition of the US economic sanctions, agreed to expand and strengthen the strategic relations of their countries, the North Korean public media reported on Monday.
Mr Diazas-Canelis, who came to Asia on his first international trip after coming to power in April, returns to Pchenjana and his wife on Sunday.
He was met by Kim Jong Unas at the airport, and the leaders came to town to welcome them.
The North Korean public media reported that the leaders held negotiations at the State House of Visitors Paekhwawon, highlighted the socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not provide much details, but indicated that the negotiating atmosphere was friendly.
The agreement with Kim Jong Unu could be seen as a warning to Washington, whose efforts to ensure significant progress on North Korea's denuclearisation are increasingly in the process.
Pchenjan, who has also recently sought the favor of Moscow, is a severe rhetoric at a meeting of US Secretary of State Mike Pompey (Maiko Pompey) and North Korea's chief negotiator Kim Yong Cholo (Kim Jong Cholo) this week in New York.
During the weekend, Pchenjan criticised the US for the unresolved sanctions - a political tool that Washington also used extensively against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea has been able to further develop a nuclear weapon programme if Washington does not change the course.
Sanctions is an important issue on the agenda of Mr Diazo-Canal.
Last week, while visiting Moscow, Mr Diazas-Canelis discussed the value-of-arms contract with Russia of nearly $50 million (EUR 43.8 million) and received similar promises to strengthen political, economic and military relations.
The two presidents then issued a joint statement condemning the United States of America's 'interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states'.
The U.S. Economic Embassy of Cuba, originally introduced in 1958, and later extended, remains in force.
The United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Russia on the annexation of Crime and support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
Mr Diazas-Canelis has to leave the country on Tuesday.
He's still visiting China, Vietnam and Laos.

Record: Athletes in 157 days surrounded Britain
On Sunday, the British took off from the sea to the coast of England, becoming the first man to cross the coast of Great Britain.
For 33 years, Ross Edgley (Ross Edgley) spent 157 days in the water and overcame 2,883 miles [2,883 km].
He was sailing six hours later, and he was on board the support team.
In the last mile, the sportsman won the ride of hundreds of colleagues.
He went to the coast in Margeite in the south-east of England - this is where on June 1 R. Edgley began his journey.
The athlete, planning to catch up in 100 days, said to his trusted neighbors on the shore, "Excuse me, I'm late."
He said that when he went to the shore first, he felt relief.
"I was very worried that my legs would not last," said the athlete.
In the open waters of the world, the association indicated that during this endurance test, R. Edgley, supported by the Red Bull energy drinks manufacturer, had repeatedly encountered extremely adverse air conditions, and even 37 times had suffered fatigue.

Makabriska Kleboniški forest secret: one suspected already detained
It was a close relative of the past, for the murderer was a minor.
Only in these circumstances was this crime known, since the victim had no relatives and was not reported.
According to the original data, he was not too old to be a full - time minister.
Just like the suspects killed him.
One of them was released by the Kaunas District Court three months ago.
A second person who is suspected to have fled to a foreign country where he is kept from the penalty for another crime is still being sought.
Until it is found, lawyers are no longer inclined to comment on the circumstances of this crime.
I. Valinskienė: I would agree with many of my children
In the new building's rock opera "Love and Death in Verona", the country's brightest artists are expanding.
Inga Valinskienė is joined by the team of artists, who have been entrusted with one of the most important works of art - a woman of course will play Juliet.
The important part of the team became Povilas Meškela, who will take care of the song of the artists.
"I think love stories from Shakespeare's time have been created a lot and very beautiful, but "Romeo and Juliet", apparently, will always remain a symbol of these stories and will still be made in various scenes for a long time.
It will be interesting to become part of one of these buildings," says I. Valinskienė about a new trial after the fall.
Although a well-known woman is well-known in the scene, she has created not one role in various performances or musicals, she has not yet been played.
"The time to play Juliet has passed," smiled I. Valinskien.
- In my time, I would probably have liked to accept such a proposal."
True, the character of the beast in Shakespeare’s drama is no less important, and some critics are even considered the most important.
The egg is not only a mediator, a helper - its way and tone of speech, a woman's attitude to feelings, and the resulting solidarity with the admirers gives more and more colors.
In addition, it is also important because it is one of the only two women in the drama "Romeo and Juliet".
"The character of a meal is not very close to my way and style, but sometimes it's just more interesting.
Creating a different character than having itself is a serious part of the creative process.
I do not know what will be the final result, because it will not only depend on me, but also on the director's interpretation, - says I. Valinskienė and reveals that while there is a sacrifice in Juliet's place, it would probably do the same.
- I think the spider was listening to her heart.
That's what most women do.
That's probably what I would do."
The legendary opera "Love and Death in Verona" of Kęstučius Antánėlios rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" is created according to the famous drama of V. Shakespeare "Romeo and Juliet".
In fact, the work is based on the tragic end of the story of two young people - Romeo and Juliet - love.
The sad end of history is uncertain as to the origin of the conflict between the young families - Monteki and the Capulets.
"All history is possible at all times.
Parents who chose their children were always and will be.
Only today's solutions to such problems are more diverse - asked if today's history of Rome and Juliet could repeat, says future cousin I. Valinskienė.
- On behalf of my children, I would agree with a lot of people, as well as with March."
The main role of the actor and director of the Ramūn Cicēn rock opera - Romeo and Juliet - will be Ieva Zasimauskaitė and Justin Jarutis, on the scene will also appear Vidas Barikis, Kęstutis Cicēn, Mindaugas Papinigs, Marius Jampolskis, Paulius Shinkūns and Aidas Barkauskas.
The latest building of the rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" will be presented to the audience at the end of December.
With the first new colors, the legendary work will be released by the viewers of Vilnius's "Siemens" Arena on 28 December.
The day after, on December 29, the rock opera will be shown at Klaipėda's "Swisture" arena.
E. Jankauskas announced with which footballers will complete the National League tournament
Lithuanian football team coach Edgar Jankauskas announced the composition of the national team for the UEFA League of Nations matches with Romania and Serbia on 17 and 20 November.

13 of them compete in foreign clubs, 10 games in Lithuanian league A.

The victims of severe trauma, Lucas Colorvis and Karolis Laukzemis, and the safe Ovidius Verbickas, the defender of Vytautas Andriuskevičius, will not be able to help.
After a three-year break, the 23-year-old Gratas Sorgėda is returned to the election.
In the national election, G.Sirgėdas won in just 18 years, following the successful 2013 European U-19 championship.
In Lithuania, the European Youth Championship G.Sirgėdas scored 3 matches and became the most successful player and was elected to the symbolic team of the championship.
Later, however, the prospective footballer’s career was halted by trauma.
After a two-year break, another representative of Kaunas Žalgirio was summoned to the election by the defender Mark Beneta.
Back in October, the victims of the traumas of the League of Nations and of Romania and Montenegro, Egidius Vatkūns and Edvinas Gardvais, returned.
"Let's try to save the first points in the League of Nations, although it's waiting for very heavy twin competitors in the squares.
In the homes of both Serbs and Romanians, we lost the minimum difference.
Lack and success.
Let us hope that the guests will be able to respond.
Although this is a decisive battle for the first-place group and the opportunity to continue the fight for the European Championship," said Lithuanian electoral coach E.Jankauskas.
Until the end of the League of Nations competitions for two rounds, the fight in Group 4 of Division C is very reprehensible.
After four tours, the first 8 points are held by Serbia's electoral team.
From the point of view of leaders remains Montenegro, two points - Romania taking third place.

"Skamp" presents the song that the video has already refused to show one television
This year, the Skamp group referred to the 20th anniversary of the operation and again intensively began to create music.
On December 26th, the only anniversary concert "Skamp20" in Vilnius's "Siemens" are announced.
This time it's "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" and the brave song video clip.
"This work is about love, so I realized that the clip should also be focused on all types of relationships, regardless of age or sexual orientation," - the new song and video clip idea reveals Erica Jennings, who is convinced that any homophobia statement in 2018 is not normal.
The new song "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" video filmed over ten different orientations and age couples: "We always supported LGBTQIA communities and we hope that one day we will no longer have to discuss it," says Viktor Diawara, who created creative music in early years during family vacations in Israel.
True, because of this video, the "Skamp" has already been able to prevent negative reactions - it does not want to show one of the most popular stories in the country.
That's a lot of talk about our society.
TV will not show up because people are fighting in it, and this is not the wrong content for children.
And that any day when televisions are on the screen, you can put on the screen a display of masks and other examples of violence is the right content?" - Retorically asked E. Jennings.
Erica and Willius Alessius said: "I would like to see more hand-to-hand-to-hand struggles and provocative people, regardless of their social status, gender or age.
We raise children and want them to grow up in an environment where there are as many tolerances as possible and as few as possible.
We want a new song and video clip to share at least a bit of our listeners' day and give them a smile."
Since 1998, the Skamp group has been playing bold songs on non-popular or opiate themes.
All the best groups - old and new - songs will sound loud and wide "Skamp20" concert already on December 26th in the Vilnius "Siemens" arena.
It awaits all with their families, and children up to 10 years of age are free of charge.

Presidency: LRT no policy ownership
In order to return to the LRT for consideration of the findings of the Commission’s clean operation, the Presidency is convinced that the executives are simply seeking to gain more political control for the public broadcaster.
"The public broadcaster is a non-political property, and the essential principle is that independence from maintaining policies," said the president's adviser Mindaugas Lingė.
However, the adviser stressed that the opposite process can now be seen.
"It is possible to see that the influence (politically. - ELTA) wants to have more.
That is what we believe to be critical enough," said Mr Linge.
According to him, the proposals of the LRT Commission operating in Seime are questionable and questionable because it applies to the independence of the broadcaster.
Although Mr Lingė stressed the need to improve the management of LRT, it should be done on the basis of expert support and in the search for specific aspects that hinder LRT's smooth operation.
He stressed that international authorities are already stressing that LRT activities should be supervised not by political but by competent authorities.
On Tuesday, Seimas intends to take a decision on the activities of the LRT to conclude the Commission's audit.
These conclusions have led to many criticisms.
The proposals to change the management of the LRT are highly sceptical: reducing the power of the Council and reaching the mandate of its members with the responsibilities of the issuing authorities.
In view of this, the European Union of broadcasters expressed concern.
The opposition group of Seimas members asked the Constitutional Court on January whether the special parliamentary commission to investigate LRT's activities and finances did not oppose the Constitution.
Workers abroad - good news from R. Karbausski
The Seimas began to consider the amendment to the Law on the Place of Residence, submitted by the Lithuanian Group of States and the Green Union, to exempt citizens working and paying taxes outside Lithuania from the payment of compulsory health insurance contributions.
On Tuesday, 56 Seimas members supported the draft, with 25 MPs detained before 9th.
The draft is scheduled to be discussed at the Seimas plenary meeting on 6 December. The Seimas also decided to request the conclusions of the Government.
In accordance with the proposed project, persons paying social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation shall, by decision of the Administrative Authority of the State Social Insurance Fund, be exempt from the payment of compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania.
Living and working outside of Lithuania, according to the procedures provided and approved by the Government Social Insurance Fund Board ("Sodra") and the State Tax Inspectorate, the data would be considered to have departed from Lithuania.
This is about services that people don't use.
There is an additional opportunity to fix that man has left," R. Karbauskis explained from the Seimas Tribune.
This proposed legal regulation, in the opinion of the Conservatory of the Seimas, would be unfair to citizens living and paying taxes in Lithuania.
"Part of the Lithuanians who live abroad abuse that," noted Mr Matulas.
Social Democrats Algird Sys believes that this is how we encourage citizens not to comply with their obligations.
In his view, the system of health protection would be free of charge for the smart.
Following the adoption of the proposed amendment of the law, persons who have moved to other countries are paid social security contributions, unscrupulous debts, an easy-to-use debt management burden for Sodros.
At present, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania, but have not declared their departures in the Register of Residents, are charged monthly for compulsory health insurance (PSD) contributions, and if they are not paid, debt is charged.
A. Duonela is convicted of fraud, but justified by fraud
The Vilnius District Court has left the sentence to appeal to the former prominent sportsman Alvydu Duonės, but he is justified by the slander of the documents.
On Monday, the court verdict was issued immediately.
A. Duonėla was sentenced to half a quarter of a year's imprisonment by abstention.
This year, the Lithuanian cowardly eviction champion was tried by the Vilnius District Court.
He was sentenced to half a quarter of a year’s imprisonment.
According to the judge’s complaint, the Vilnius District Court removed one charge, but the penalty remained the same.
The former athlete will also have to pay nearly 760 euros for the Crimes Fund.
Prosecutor A. Duonėla accused him of counterfeiting a vest in 2013, where his ex-wife, Dalios Burokaitė, now in charge of the dental office "Dalezia" he claimed 200 thousand litas (about 58 euros).
The couple only met in December 2016 when they were invited to cover the loan.
The former spouse said that he had never been in debt and had never been in bed before for the money clinic.
According to Vilnius District Court judges, there is no objective data in the case proving that it is precisely A. Duonėla that it is true that it is not the debt of UAB "Delecija" to A. Duonėla 200 thousand litas.
The arguments set out in the complaint by the judge and his defendant are in line and there are no supporting objective data in the case.
In this way, when it is found that A. Duonėla has only used the faked true document for deception and has acknowledged that these signs - the use of the faked document - are a complex part of fraud (in the present case - the fraud of deception), A. Duonėla is justified in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Criminal Code, without evidence that he was involved in committing a criminal act", says Vilnius District Court judgment.
The firemen led the ground in shackles - the kneading was heard for three days
As reported by the Fire Management Board of Kaunas County, a three-day notification was received that the boilers were slammed after the heat exchange.
When the fires arrived, they also heard the cat’s crack.
It is clear that a few days ago the heat track repair work was carried out here.
It is likely that two cats could have been turned to the ground during the closing of the track under the roof.
The fires dropped the surface of the heat path, which is half a meter high, and it poured out the gap to the cats.
The son of Antonino Scalia says his father's unscrupulous liberal protests about Kavanaugh
Judge Antonino Scalia of the Supreme Court told the Fox News on Sunday that his father’s protest against the appointed Judge Brett Kavanaugh was not surprising because Scalia thought that the Supreme Court was too involved in the affairs of the modern world.
"Generally speaking, it would be very unfavourable for nomination to the Supreme Court, because much is based on Roe before Wade's case – at least as far as the left is concerned," said Christopher Scalia, recalling a significant 1973 case, after which the constitutional right of women to abortion was established for certain trimesters.
In the case of Roe, on the one hand, the rights of all states to regulate abortions themselves and some countries, in response to this decision, have immediately tried to restrict the right to abortion.
"My father often said that Roe v. Wade and in other cases the court really tried to solve cultural problems, although they had to be dealt with through the election process and the law publishing process," he added through the show in Fox & Friends."
"In order to speed up the proceedings, the Supreme Court has caused even more damage, and therefore nominations to the Supreme Court and the dispute concerning the approval result in a more serious reaction, since the judges assume the role of legislators."
The Senator of Nebraska, Ben Sasse, at this month's meeting on the approval of Kavanaugh, expressed a similar opinion, repeating that the Congress often gives too much power to the executive authorities, who are essentially non-confidential, and leaves some bureaucratic issues to the Supreme Court, and therefore the judges have to take the work that the senators refuse.
The police seized and accused hundreds of protestors of illegal interference with the candidate's approval process.
Asked whether Kavanaugh could avoid adverse reactions due to unconfirmed sexual misconduct that he had committed several decades ago, Scalia said she would probably not be able to avoid noise.
In reply to statements that Kavanaugh should not go to the Supreme Court because on Thursday during the senators' polls, there was a heated reaction, and sometimes, Scalia questioned whether all the judges were of a peaceful nature.
"The judges are often confused," said Scalia, referring to the evil disagreements that sometimes arise in conflicting cases.
"True, Judge Kavanaugh must have reacted more aggressively, but that was different circumstances.
He tried to defend his good name against unconfirmed accusations."
On Thursday, a majority of the party's votes (11 before 10) were allowed to participate in the entire Senate vote.
Senator Jeff Flake of the Republic of Arizona stated a dramatic moment that he would only give his decisive vote to Kavanaugh if FTB were to be given a week for investigations into the violation of the current probable charges, expressed to Kavanaugh.
The investigation is ongoing and President Shortas said that the Agency has broad mandates and can only be consulted as soon as it wishes.
Shiaparelli in a collection of ready-made clothing – fantastic work
Is Surrealism Possible?
Schiaparelli tried to answer this question.
The Paris fashion house, founded almost a hundred years ago by Elsa Schiaparelli, presented its first collection of ready clothes and handcuffs.
This collection is almost as incredible as the famous Elsa Schiaparelli turned the shape of the boat.
The eccentric image of the long-painted fashion house appeared this time and how modern.
In aesthetic solutions, you will find sensations, ulcers, hearts, and eyes.
Schiaparelli created his first combination in 1930 and was the first designer whose models scored the podium according to music.
She and her friend Salvador Dali were planning to reconcile art and fashion, and now Calvin Klein and Rafas Simons, working with US artist Sterling Ruby, took this idea.
A clever legend that Dali, together with Schiaparelli, had set up an evening dress on the occasion of the demonstration, wanted to throw out a real mayonnaise, but he did not agree.

"We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation, which is not separate from the story of Schiaparelli," said Bertrand Guyon, who has been working for the creation director for the last three years, speaking at the fashion hall in Vandams Square.
In creating a collection of ready-made clothes, he supported Schiaparelli with Meu Ray and, in collaboration with My Ray's Foundation, created clothes based on well-known works of art.
The sound picture of the artist's close-looking eyes "Glass" is shown on masks painted with Perspex tears, and red lips from "Observatory Time: Lovers" are printed on a true silhouette dress with a collage.

One of Elsa's adventures was a pleasant attraction to the character of S. His firm color – "Schoky pink" inspired her breath "Schoky".
"Schiaparelli" is the first hand created by Guyon, with a key key on the bell called "Psalm".
Its retail price will also be fantastic – £5,000.
Yesterday, in the old left-hand warehouse, a temporary shop was opened where the surrealistic half of Paris' fashion week was demonstrated and for 100 € it was possible to purchase Virgil's Abloho's rides from the Ikea collection that appeared soon.
For the remainder of the half-hour before opening, more than 500 young Abloho fans pulled out on the front line, not trying to buy one of his works at a more favourable price than Louis Vuitton's men's clothes.
Aflohui this project helps to reach a wider audience than the one available for luxury fashion or furniture designers.
“No one has any ownership anymore, but knowledge of a certain seat can help to establish a conversation at the southern table.
That's what a thousand-year-old thinks," he said recently.
In the Marai area, the observers realized that this event in the garage would not be a regular event when the models began to walk through them on the wheels.
The Vivien Westwood male designer Andreas Kronthaler's free coloring male and female screens collection was based on portraits of Jessicas Fulford-Dobson Cabul's riders.
Some of the women who were soaked with sandals (and some men) rode by riders, but the snow - covered high - altitude platform went by itself.
Westwood, having observed the show in the first row and wearing the collection dress with horse motives and an orange bounded cardigan, joined her husband for the last exposure on the podium to offer her flower beauty.
Strong double-link in photos
Detroit was born and Peter Zelewskis, who lived in London, was already a street photographer when he started photographing two years ago.
"I am like a portrait photographer and a human being, and I have always been fascinated by the twins and the strange connection they all talk about," he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the whole project, but he said, “I gained independence and no way back from photographing the first two portraits.”
Soon, in the book "Dwynjas" in Zelewski, 44 identical two-pair photographs and stories will be printed.
This project is more visual, he says: "It's not a documentary or a scientific project – I wanted to photograph people's influential and sensitive portraits."
Employees have expressed their distrust of the trade union, which has led to negotiations on wages
Members of the Royal College of Care, not satisfied with the trade union’s transaction with the National Health Service for wages, expressed their distrust after the vote and accused her of breaking the requirements for the increase in the salary expected.
This unprecedented decision was taken after a lengthy discussion at the Royal College of Care, when his former Secretary-General, Janeta Davies, wrongly promised members that their wages would increase by 3% immediately this year, when a 1% pay limit would be lifted.
Upon the arrival of the expected salary, the members became angry and forced Davies to resign, then filed a petition, and on Friday held an emergency meeting in Birmingham, after which the college board expressed their distrust.
"The honest and open debate in Birmingham has helped to clarify the relationship, so the college will only strengthen," said the Director of the Royal College of Services Maria Trewern.
“The Council and the Governing Council of the Royal Service College understood the message sent to it.
In recent weeks, the Council has already made changes in the organisation and has tried to listen to the words of the members and to include them; we will continue to try to implement them."
The meeting will be held next week and will be expected to be held by members of the Council of the Kingdom Service College.
"The basis of the service is trust," said the National Health Service's nurse to the Guardian newspaper.
"The actions of the Royal College Council have undermined its confidence, and the Council must therefore withdraw.
I hope that she will do so in honor of and in obedience to the request.
It is interesting whether members of other trade unions will also seek reform."
National Health Service official Rachel Harrison said August “Guardian” said, “I received a salary, National Health Service staff from all over the country did not understand the expected setback.
That's what ruined them."
Before the extraordinary meeting, the Royal College of Care acknowledged that it had made mistakes in the 2018 remuneration negotiations and had misinformed about them.
However, it is also stated that the Royal College's campaign for the abolition of the pay limitation has forced the government to renounce this restriction and to promise to gradually increase the wages of 6.5% within three years.
The vote was held after an independent study which found that the college was willing to give up in the negotiations and Davies was convicted of not carefully assessing the transaction.
The Royal College of Care is said to have provided inconsistencies with information that does not correspond to the facts, and therefore the Members were unable to take a reasoned decision on the transaction and did not consider alternatives.
The College published conflicting information on whether all employees would expect a 3% increase in wages.
In a short report before the college's adoption, representatives were mistakenly told that the planned "3% rise and increase in the phased implementation of the reform" was planned.
In fact, wages had to be gradually raised to 3%, and only some of the workers who received the highest wages would have been rapidly increasing.
"The information provided to the members after the acquisition was almost incorrect (probably because it was tried to simplify it)" said the representative of the Electoral Reform Service who conducted the investigation.
‘The ESR considers that the differences between the existing system and the proposed transaction and the main advantages, including 6,5 % and 29 % of the calculations mentioned by the campaign, have not been clearly explained to the parties to the decisions, and therefore it has not been possible to take a reasoned decision.’
78% of the voter voted against and 3.74% of the members of the Royal Service College took part in the vote.
Lindsay Lohan shocked the viewers of the Instagram live broadcast by trying to steal children from the family
Lindsay Lohan was criticised for the direct broadcast of Instagram, through which she followed the twin family on the street and tried to separate her sons from her parents.
Direct broadcasts, probably filmed in Moscow (according to Lohan's previous updated Instagram history), offered to provide the family with a place of night, but the situation was quickly complicated.
“Good for all! I want to show you which family I have met,” she told the viewers, “the refugees from Syria, I am very concerned about them.
They really need help.
Do you want to come with me?
Let's go, I'll take care of you," she said to the family before going to one of the kids: "Would you like to stay at the hotel?
Watch the movies?
It would be nice to watch a movie on TV or a computer."
When his parents refused, Lohan reacted in a negative way.
“Your children should not be on the street, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
“If anyone offers them houses and lodging, as I do now, you should agree.
They're coming back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't mess with me."
When the family tried to leave Lohan on the street, the actor followed her directly through Instagram.
“Look what’s going on – it’s child trade. So you’re working on Arab culture.
You're married to your children, even though they don't want to go with you.
Boys, don't worry, I'm with you and now the whole world sees us."
Translation ended in physical confrontation – it seems that Lohan was broken by her mother.
The video clips spread in the social media, and some users wondered if this could not be comparable to a trial.
The Independent met with the representative of Lohan for comments.
A third of British people believe that they will never pay for all the debts they have
Almost a third of the British believe that they will not be able to cover their debts in life, and one in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
A study carried out by Equifax and Gorkana, which revealed only The Independent, showed that the British, particularly members of the 18-24 group, believed that they would have a lifetime of debt, and only half of them expected to get rid of it.
Last year, the report published by the Institute for Fiscal Research states that the students who have completed the study are about 46,000 dollars in debt, while the poorest students are more than 57,000 pounds in debt.
Most graduates (81 per cent) have never paid all their debts, so the first 30 years of work have been forced into debt.
Public debt is growing: According to the National Statistics Department, United Kingdom family debt is a record-size and British average issues more than $900 per year than earnings.
However, is it worth worrying about this fear statistics?
Is the whole of the printing industry simply a new usual way of life for young adults (and society as a whole)?
As an example, cars that are other steam buyers are bought at home (if such a success has occurred).
Auto Trader predicted this week that in the decade all new cars will be purchased on a fee basis – this will be the usual way to buy vehicles.
EQ Investors Director and certified financial planner Jeannie Boyle believes that expectations have really changed.
“In these times, it is normal to have debts: the popular credit card, the interest-free refinancing, the student loans and the fast credit”, she said.
"The times of our elders were a shame to have debts."
At this time, the debt of student loans and housing prices has become a normal feature.
This statement is also supported by the Head of the Personal Finance Section of the Interactive Investor, Moira O'Neill, who believes that the results can cause concern.
“If you borrow a large amount of money that exceeds your income four or five times, you may appear to have nothing to do with any additional debt,” she explained.
And that's how people get into trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so people with large loans or other debts have to think about what would happen if the rates were to rise."
It should probably not be observed that there is no doubt about the comments made by the financial industry.
Brian Brodie's director of the Freedom Finance loan agency says: "Schools are not taboo.
Loans for the repair of homes or new car are no longer held by the latest exits.
With low interest rates, many have contributed to the savings of the term deposits from which a higher return is obtained, but it is not so easy to achieve savings.
Therefore, the middle class is increasingly borrowing.
In the last six months, about half of the new loans have been taken by customers with a good credit rating."
Richard Haymess, Head of the Department of Financial Problems of the Equifax company TDX Group, believes that such expectations – and not to mention the whole life of debt – are of real concern.
He says: “Inflation in August was the highest within six months (2.7 percent), interest rate rose, and employment increased slightly, so it is not surprising that many people decide to borrow without a realistic plan to repay debts.
Our analysis has shown that this year the number of bankruptcys will increase by 17 per cent, and the main factor is the record of consumer lending."
Debts may not worry much about the time when a person works and earns, but it is not clear how unpaid debt will affect his well - being throughout life.
The study of the Economic and Business Research Centre carried out in conjunction with the funding for invested property specialists from More 2 Life showed that people's undeclared debt increased by more than a third over the last four years, i.e. by more than twice the country's average.
This age group usually borrows credit cards and spends 30 per cent more than earnings each month.
Boyle added: “More and more people are choosing to pay off their pension funds by 55 years of age, and this will affect their life in retirement.
This is most often the only savings they had to save.
In addition, people think that the use of assets will go away later, but if they change their assets to a cheaper one, they do not get as much money as they expect.
If the price of the assets falls, this situation will only become difficult."
Several years ago, Serena Williams, who was raised to half the age of I Touch Myself, said that he wanted to focus on breast cancer.
Serena Williams released a video in which she sings the classic "Divinyls" song "I Touch Myself" with her hands rubbed with her nose.
Teniso’s axis shared the clip on his Instagram page and explained that a video was created to encourage a woman to check her own breast.
"I wrote this month the World Hit "The Divinyls" version of "I Touch Myself" to remind women to check regularly for themselves," Williams wrote.
"So I came out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do so, because this problem affects all races around the world.
Most important, it helps save many lives as soon as possible.
I hope I can remind women of that."
Williams continued: "This music clip is part of the project "I Touch Myself Project", which is carried out in honour of the famous Chrissy Amphlett – she died of breast cancer and gave us her hit in order to remind women first to take care of their health."
The project was launched in 2014 after the death of Amphlett, a project supported by the lower brand "Berlei for Breast Cancer Network Australia" (BCNA).
The video, published by the tennis star in his Instagram account, received more than 1.5 million reviews and many patients' honours for how the tennis player sang the song.
"I'd love to do that for this clip and your courage to do it.
Thank you, Serena," wrote one fan.
Another added: “Serena, this is NOSTABU.
20 years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and a tumor myself, even when the mammograms showed nothing.
It's just necessary to check.
Thank you for not being afraid to leave the comfort zone – you really are a ghost!"
For the "Berley" project "I Touch Myself Project" also released a new letter of live skin "The Chrissy", which was inspired by the rock star.
100 percent of the profits received after the sale of the roll will be paid to BCNA.
It is important to know which signs and symptoms should be searched for in the self-test.
The signs of breast cancer are not only musculoskeletal, but also altered breast size or shape, rash or scars, exacerbated from the spinal cord, skin surface swelling, permanent pain or changes in skin texture.
In addition, there may be a hint of swelling of the skin or of the keyboard, a suspense of the veins and an insomnia of the spinal cord.
Women are advised to check their breast every month.
If you notice any signs of breast cancer, NHS recommends that you contact your family doctor immediately.
If you have been examined by your family doctor, your symptoms should be further evaluated, he will send you to the breast cancer clinic.
Adam Driveris forced the entire SNL filming group to evaporate
Adam Driver was this week's "Saturday Night Live" guest star and actually tried to make everyone laugh.
The best jokes are not often related to a specific event – as is the new exhibition called "The Day of Life".
On the day of the U.S. high school, when the students bring up their parents, and the adult Mortdecai (Pete's Davidson) disagrees reluctantly that his father, the old oil magnet Abraham H. Parnasus (Adam Driver), would speak the language.
In Lazdell, Parnasus, whose megalomanic personality could have inspired Daniel Day-Lewis, Daniel Plainview's actor, from the movie 'Bus Blood', describes how the oil industry managed.
"I was born seven months early," Parnasus told his students.
“Incubator technologies were just discovered, so I was put in a iron bowl and heated in the pizza oven until I learned to walk.
My bones didn't shake like that, but not my spirit!
Be strong and shake your enemies!"
Davidson and his colleague SNL actor Aidy Bryant, who plays as a teacher, is almost unrelenting and cannot look into the driver’s eyes.
However, the actors of Star Wars only run away and he begins to talk about the personal war with another oil magnet H. R. Pickins.
"I've led your uncle!" he shouts.
"I have filled her belly with my laboring seeds, and I have poisoned your boy, that is my final wound, H.R.!"
In less than five minutes, the coroner became the same memory of Adam Driver's character as Kyle Renee from two films.
"Fuck you, H.R.!"
Killed by Kendrick Lamar's songs: Eight Unheard Works appeared on the Internet
It seems that many songs of Kendrick Lamar have been lost.
On Saturday, eight of us went online to not hear the songs that were played by the parties SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay'us Rockas, Isaiah Rashadas and Abis Soulas.
It is not clear where the song is coming from, and the title of the set "Bad Kid Chill City EP" and the illustration of the cover (which is likely to be created by the fans) is not official.
Only demonstrative and unfinished versions of songs that sound as if recorded at different stages of Lamar’s career could be lost.
Gang Member could belong to the Good Kid Maad City era, and Heroin, which was corrupted together with SZA, was similar to the sound track "DAMN./Black Panther".
The following songs shall be placed on the market:
‘Gang Member’;
‘The Only Nigga’;
'For In Life';
‘Loved Ones’ (with SZA);
"Own This City";
‘Heroin (with SZA, Jay'umi Rocku, Isaiah'u Rashadu and Ab Soul)’;
"Look Over Your Shoulders" (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson);
"Swimming Pools Alternative".
The Independent contacted the representative of Kendrick Lamar for his comment.
The story about the music "Chikaga": In Klaipeda there are no tickets invited to go to Vilnius or Kaunas
Lithuanian wishes to see Klaipeda’s state music theatre music “Chikaga” - do not pray.
For this reason, the most popular Lithuanian musicians of all time have prepared for another tour across the country’s largest arena.
However, after about 1.5 months before the show, the halls have to be raised.
The organizers announce that all tickets have already been sold to music in Klaipėda's "Switurio" arena, and the tickets are quickly dislodged and on events in Kaunas "Zalgirio" and Vilnius "Siemens" arenas.
There is no longer any time in the city for tickets, so all who want to see this indisputable music, we invite you to go to Kaunas or Vilnius, where the tickets are a little bit more.
The demonstrations will take place in December, so not only will you see our music from beyond, but you will also have a great opportunity to look at the largest cities of the country," says the head of the Klaipeda State Theatre Laima Vilimienė.
The audience of Chicago will experience a change in the composition of the artists.
One of the main musical roles was first entrusted to the actor Tom Giaubi.
Talenting and from TV screens is a well-known actor in Chicago to the unrepeated Billy Flynn - the best and most influential Chicago lawyer, without the changing fate of people.
Because Klaipeda’s state music theatre music music music “Chikaga” is adapted to larger spaces, arenas, the composition of its artists is also larger than the creation shown in Brodva.
In the Lithuanian "Chicago" there are twenty artists on the horse.
The main roles of women to trust the admirers of Klaipeda State Music Theatre Solitary Beatai Ignatavičiūti (killed Velma Kelly) and the charismatic Kaunas Music Theatre Solitary Gabrieli Bielskyte (killed Roxie Hart).
The Chicago music depicts the criminal world of Chicago in the third decade of the 19th century, which transforms the prison walls into a mountain of stars.
It is a musical council of criminal justice, speaking of two murderers seeking attention and recognition.
The music is overexposed by sexuality and irony.
No matter where or what the main heroes - Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly - the meaning of life - would be to shine in a shining star.
Their life is life because of the message on the first page, because of the title, the glowing, the glory of the olive tree...
On 13 December, Chicago will be displayed in Klaipėda's "Switurios" arena, on 18 December - Kaunas "Zalgirio" arena, on 20 December - Vilnius "Siemens" arena.
The ticket's on the ticket.
Website furniture in Kaunas
The website can be called a representative home area, where we allow time for friends, guests, and so on. Therefore, it should be installed in such a way that it is not only suitable for apartment or house owners but also for guests.
Depending on the size of the site, the wall, ceiling decoration, the taste of the owners, the appropriate furniture should be selected.
The site should be not only nice, but also convenient.
Best help in inviting an interior designer, which will help to optimally fill the space so that it is not overloaded or vice versa - too empty.
It is recommended to first identify the main site point, i.e. the item to which you combine furniture, other details.
This may be a church or other important accent of the site interior.
It would also be good to create a chat room where guests could communicate comfortably so as not to interfere with the furniture and so on.
Sofos, the chairs should be arranged close to each other so that your guests can sit down and talk.
Thus, furniture should promote communication, unite people, not distance them from one another.
Don't push the furniture to the wall.
The size of the room depends on what distance it should be from the borders.
Although the room is small, at least a few places away from the wall, do not push the furniture at the same time.
If the room is large, leave more space from the walls.
Actually, the longer the distance, the better.
Create a balance with your furniture
Consider the various details that will be available on your website.
All elements must be negotiated with each other.
The site furniture must be compatible with the interior details.
Possible low contrast.
It will revive the interior of the site, but it should not be too big, because the interior will become inconvenient.
We are always advised to consult interior designers.
By creating a site interior yourself, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you may be tempted to deviate from the extremes: or create a barrier interior because you are afraid to experiment, err, choose improperly, or try again improvised.
Appropriate lighting
This is a very important thing.
The different light reveals the space differently.
The lighting shall be set at different levels: ceiling lamps, wall lamps, on the floor of the lamp.
Prosecutor's Office appealed a preliminary ruling to the LCF leaders
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office has appealed to the judges of the Vilnius District Court for a preliminary ruling from the Lithuanian Carp Federation (LKF).
As reported by the prosecutor's office on Monday, the complaint states that the Municipality of Panevėži had no legal basis to contribute to the reconstruction of the municipal budget of the private hotel in Panevėži.
In the pre-trial investigation, it was established that, in order to find the possibility of financing the reconstruction of the hotel, a public procurement and sales contract was concluded in 2010 between the Lithuanian Carp Federation and the Municipality of Panevėži.
The prosecutors claim that part of the services provided by the federation to the municipality of Paneveži city under that contract had not been provided and could not be provided, since the planned provision of services had already been received or planned to be financed by the State and sponsors, part of the planned events had already taken place before the signing of the contract and had already been paid out of other funds, and part of the events had taken place since the receipt of the VAT invoices - the money was transferred to the account invoices for the events not yet completed.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor’s Office argues inconsistencies with the judgment of the Court of First Instance that the State itself has imposed and ordered the Municipality of Panevėži to undertake private hotel reconstruction, since no State obligation for a specific hotel has been imposed, only the proposal has been made to the Municipality of Panevėžiši as soon as possible to address the issues of hotel development required for the championship.
In the opinion of the prosecutor, the court found that the LCF and the head of the Municipality of Paneveži attempted to fulfil the State's obligation without having legal grounds to see from the facts in the case that there was a possibility of holding European basketball championship competitions in other cities without prejudice to the law.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office, in an appeal, seeks to abolish the judgment of the Court of First Instance and in this case to adopt a new - guilty - judgment on seven natural persons and one legal person.
The Vilnius District Court on 15 October for all crimes committed by the LCF fully justified Mindaug Balčiūn by the Secretary-General of the LCF.
This case relates to the preparation for the 2011 European Men's basketball championship in Lithuania.
Mr Balchiun was accused of abuse, fraud and other crimes.
The prosecutor, Mr Balčiūnas, accused him of having agreed on the duties of the Secretary-General of the LCF with the Finance Officer and Executive Director of the Federation in order to record, on behalf of the Federation, the non-conformity of the performance of the works - transfer acts and other financial documents and accounts provided to the municipality of Panevėžių LKF to be included in the official accounts.
According to a survey carried out by the Special Investigation Services (STT) officials of the Panevėži Board, the funds of the Municipality of Panevėžių could be misleading and clasting documents for the benefit of the LKF and the reconstruction of the Hotel Via Unica, later used by the hotel "Romantic".
This hotel manager Dalia Kuklierienė is accused of papering - it is suspected that she has given Mr Balčiūnu television as a gift.
All the persons entitled to justice with Mr Balchiun.
The charges in this case were brought to eight natural persons and to one legal person - the Lithuanian Carp Federation.
Remote place of work - like Bermuda triangle
In Lithuania, the number of people injured or killed in work since 1992 has already exceeded the total number of people living in the city of Alyta by about 83 thousand.
If the specific physical workplace and its security requirements appear to be clear, it becomes a truly new Bermuda triangle to be a choice to work remotely - from home, public spaces or even other countries.
According to insurance professionals, although the Workers’ Safety and Health Act provides for remote workers to create conditions of safety and health that do not differ from other employees of the company, a variety of modern forms of work may lead to many questions, the press report writes.
In the event of an accident in the future, for the first two days of unemployment, 80% of the compensation is paid by the employer and for the rest of the period is Sodra.
If it is found that an accident occurred during work - since the first day of unemployment, Sodra will compensate 100 per cent of the wage.
The assessment of the statistics submitted by the State Labour Inspectorate and the damage to BTA is evident that the total number of accidents and various injuries occur at work.
These are most often various physical works, where the risk of injury is greater: they are treated with devices or equipment, losing concentration or coordination.
However, offices where most of the respondents, the best-paid specialists, have now been brought together, face their own challenges that employers are faced with and the freedom of mobility that employees enjoy," says BTA Head of Human Resources Management Jevgenija Krikščiūnė.
The legislation in force in Lithuania recommends a clear regulation of the employee's duties and limits of liability, defining working time, place and functions, which also applies in the form of a long-term job.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether an accident occurred at work or not.
There are indeed a variety of situations and nuances, each case being dealt with individually.
Employers are often heard that the employer is responsible for the accident at work or from work.
However, there are a lot of nuances and reservations in this case, so I would encourage both workers and employers to start conversations, to find out and, as a matter of fact, to make it clear to both sides what situations are actually considered to be an accident at work, and to which the status of home injuries will already arise," advises the expert.
J. Kriskīņė states that in these times, when the functions of a computer and mobile phone and a stable internet connection are often sufficient, the employee will not necessarily work at the place specified in the agreement and at the time specified.
Employees are mobile, they can choose to work not at home today, while drinking coffee in a cafe or park enjoying the sun.
Is this going to be a job or not?
What if the hours of work under consideration are not in line with the agreement envisaged?
It is possible to experience a truly unparalleled situation which helps clarify the circumstances of the investigation, the launch of "Sodros" or State Labour Inspections", says the expert.
In their view, the main difference in financial terms between the event’s work and the future is the amount of unemployment benefit.
Mr Krisčīņa admits that there has been an informal hearing of unfavourable experiences, when employers try to hide the true circumstances of accidents or traumas and try to persuade workers to seek medical advice at work, to take responsibility for themselves, thus dissipating financially.
This is an unfair, disrespectful attitude toward the employee and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of the people already mentioned encourages the search for additional instruments that could help businesses in similar situations: the insurance of the employer's civil liability for injury to workers, the acquisition of accident insurance against injury, disability or even death, as well as the acquisition of relevant and health insurance," says J. Krikščiūnė.
Mobile signature system is back in operation

The situation in Estonia was also fixed, but the representatives of SK ID Solutions were unable to comment on the situation in that country.
Lithuanian Regbio Collection - Polish lessons
The European Trophy division of the debuting Lithuanian Regbio team is still hard to match with higher-level competitors.
The Trophy division in the Old Land is the third in the capacity of the six-nation tournament and the European Championship.
There are 13-18 field teams with a rating.
The Lithuanians started a solid victory at Šiaulia 30:10 before the Czech command.
And last weekend the Lithuanian election in Lodź, where it is not the Polish election - 0:33 (0:12).
Although the Lithuanians were willing to defend themselves, they often violated the rules in the mines and the Polish governors were forced to strike the fine.
In 3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes of the fine, Wojciech Piotrovicius gave his own 12-point rebuff.
On the first floor, the Lithuanians had to play without a yellow card from the Little People’s Party.
In the second row, the guests had several attacks, but the results were not successful.
At the time, the Polishmen were able to break up their defenses.
The amulet was pressed in the accounting area by Mateusza Plichta, later by Kristian Pogorzelski and Mateusza Adamski.
In addition to several important directors, a Lithuanian electoral coach from the PAR Ntando Manyosha acknowledged the advantages of the competitors and claimed that such competitions provided a lot of valuable experience.
"Lenka played very well and dominated all the game components.
Our goal was to stay as long as possible in these games.
We just get up to this higher level and we have to understand it.
We won the first match against the checks, but now we met very powerful competitors, and we had to recognize their advantage.
The Polish elections gave us useful lessons," said a specialist from PAR, who has been standing at the Lithuanian elections for four years.
Next match "Trophy" division Lithuanian games on 6 April 2019 home with Portuguese or Romanians.
This division still competes with the Dutch and Swiss teams.

Japanese coast guard is searching hard for the poor islands
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - such a name was given to the entire island of northern Japan in 2014.
Little, worthless and valueless island, which was largely inadequate for life, was very important to Japan.
It is so important that its territory is now under intense scrutiny - perhaps it is still emerging?
Why does Japan need this island?
You won't.
It is likely that the ice and the submergence of this island have survived all the time, although it has been almost two feet [2 m] above the surface recently.
It is almost certain that the island simply collapses, but at least its footprints are expected to be found.
When the island began, no one knew exactly - it was so worthless that no one got too much of it and didn't win.
It is likely that the first of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima’s initial knowledge of Japanese fishermen who used the island as an aid to the visual navigation tool.
Their disappearance is not a tragedy even for these fishermen because there are better ways to catch where fish can be fished and where the Russian waters begin to quarrel.
That was the meaning of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima.
This narrow strip of land was the very western inscriptions of the Kurilian Island.
This island chain, known by Russia as the Kuril Islands, and Japan as the Northern Territories.
The conflict with such interruptions has continued since the middle of the 19th century, but the full force began in the 20th century.
In these areas there are natural resources, but Japan historically believes that the islands should belong to it.
The point is that these islands have been researching since the mid - 17th century.
They first developed a map, took more detailed studies, registering a number of small halls.
The agreements signed in 1855 between Japan and Russia indicated that the stalls correspond to Sachalin and to Japan are all the islands of the Kuril.
So these two states lived until 1905, when the Russian Empire lost Sachalina in the war for Japan.
In 1945 the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and opened the Kuril Islands.
Japan, by the way, does not mean large claims to the whole island, although it was the first, but would like to have four islands - Iturup, Kunashio, Šikotan Islands and Chabomayas.
Japan feels that it has historical rights because the island was the first to examine and belonged to Japan under the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan proposed that Russia divide these four islands by level, but Russia did not even consider adopting such a proposal.
Japan is quite close to the Northern Territories, but now the initial islands this geographic connection is as if lost.
It's the physical sign of Japan's presence in those waters.
This is a major loss, which is why the rest of the island is being searched for.
However, even if they are found, Esanbe Hanakita Kojima will not meet the definition of a simple island - it must be dry.
This means that there will be a slight decrease in the territory of Japan and a strong decrease in the Exclusive Economic Area, calculated from the coast.
It's just interesting what an island search mission is waiting for - that it's not really going to be this way or that way.
Incredible drama in the Lithuanian and Polish Boxing Elections
It took more than a week to wait for the final verdict of the judges who became the winners of a cross-border meeting between the Lithuanian and Polish boxing voters.
There were nine Polish and Lithuanian twins in Poland.
Four eyes won by Lithuanians, as well as Polish.
The final decision of the long-term panel of judges and the secretariat of the competitions was taken at the end of the decision.
The election started with the victory of the Lithuanian boxers.
The Lithuanian champion Marius Vyšniauskas (weighting category up to 52 kg) secured 3:0 won Jakob Sourma, soon Edgars Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) won Radomira Obrušniak after the match 2:1.
Two masters followed: Damianas Durkaczas (up to 64 kg) 3:0 defeated Manta Dužina, while Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) 2:1 prophesied Simon Banya.
Vytautas Balsys (up to 75 kg) returned to Lithuania.
Lithuania 2:1 defeated Bartos Golebiewski.
In the next battle, Piotras Szczukowkis (up to 81 kg) in the third round was clearly revised to defeat Eigrida Casmosi and the result again became equal to 3:3.
He followed the brothers in different ways.
Robert Jakulis (up to 91 kg) 3:0 defeated Andrzej Kolton, and Arvyd Jakulis (over 91 kg) had to recognize the advantage of Adam Kulik in the first round.
Most of the discussions were held by Tado Tamashusko (up to 91 kg) and by Michalo Soczynski's struggle.
The publication of the final outcome of its cross-border meeting took more than a week.
One judge awarded a victory for the stage, two judges for the Lithuanian, but due to a technical error the point for the Lithuanian judge was read to Mr. Soczynski.
After the long-lasting battles, the Polish boxingman left - 2:1.
The Lithuanian and Polish elections were won at 10:8 (two points awarded for the victory) by the owners.
They managed to provoke the Lithuanians for the last paired loss of their mates.
In 2015 at the Marijampolje meeting, Lithuanian boxers won even five fights out of six and sought a victory at 10:2.
The meeting of Lithuanian election leaders in Poland was a general repetition before 14-17 November. The Lithuanian boxing championship in Šilutė was held in Šilutė.
After the country's priorities, a new Lithuanian boxing election will be formed, which will defend the country's glory in the next year's world and European championships.
How does a dog determine the direction in which a person walked?
You already know that the dog is very sensitive.
They may cover hidden explosives, narcotics, blood, other animals, some even recognise diseases by smell.
It is also well known that the dog’s trails are heard in the movies, but their work is much more difficult than you thought.
How do they determine the direction in which the owner of the footsteps went?
This is actually something more complicated than you think.
The follow-up consists of three steps - finding, identifying and tracking the direction.
The second stage is much more difficult than the other two, since it is difficult to decide which direction a person has taken.
Well, between different steps, there's not a second, so their flavor doesn't really differ, right?
Not quite.
As early as 1990, a study by the University of Oslo described experiments that led the dog to a 90 degree angle in the trajectory that the man passed.
Tests to be carried out on grass and asphalt.
And in many cases the dog easily set the path of a man, even when he tried to deceive them by past openings.
Can you imagine the complexity of this assignment?
The difference between the side of the traces is very low and, in time, it decreases even more.
However, scientists say it's not that weird - a dog could say, and which part of the foot has hit the ground first.
This is because their tail is an incredible tool.
Dogs dominate the areas responsible for the bear (as our brain dominates the regions responsible for the vision).
Dog nose has 125-300 million receptors.
In general, dogs are at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but their ability to interpret different flavors plays an even greater role.
Scientists then carried out analogous experiments and with bicycles left behind, but their direction was much more difficult for dogs to follow.
This is because bike cancer is not segmented as a current human footprint, so it's harder to isolate different places for comparison - it's not natural for dogs, so it takes more time.
True, dogs are not the strongest owners of the bear.
This title would probably correspond to the holes.
Hundreds of miles of white spots are followed by women who are ready to marry, and the rudder bears catch up with an animal up to 20 miles [30 km].
In private forests, it promises to regulate movements
Minister of the Environment Kęstutis Navickas will explain on Tuesday in Seem about the drilling of forests.
At the end of August, public dissatisfaction arose over the forests in the Lebanese regional park.
The moon was suspended by the rotation of these forests.
The Minister has acknowledged that the study of the changes in the Lebanese Republic has shown that there have been no gross violations.
However, the Ministry of the Environment has already introduced some restrictions in view of the proposal by the working group to strengthen forest rotation in forests belonging to the State.
The Minister promises that other legislation adjusting forest movements will be prepared by the end of the year.
It is also intended to apply the same restrictions as those in national forests that apply to the management of private forests.
Agnie Jagelavičiūtė revealed a strategy to build 170 thousand followers
People need to give what they want, and at the same time get what they want, in the LRT television game "Culturally with Nomad" says Agnie Jagelavičiūtė.
According to the stylists, she gradually built a huge crowd of fans.
"In the beginning, I enjoy the taste of man, moving to myself, and in time, it will be better for a little while," says A. Jagelavičiūtė.
A. Jagelavičiūtė has more than 170 thousand followers in his Facebook account - it has reached such a number by using a certain strategy: "I'm at first enjoying the taste of man, moving to myself, running a little better after that taste."
Stylist A. Jagelavičiūtė claims to be harmless uncertainty, so he shows his face as he is - the authenticity and the ability to find the best way of presenting is the most important criteria in the social networks of popularity.
It notes that there is no longer any human culture on social networks, because many internet users are bringing them up to date in order to be angry or to read comments from other people who are turning around: "For example, there was a time in adolescence when I wanted to hang out with everyone and change - now I don't want to do that anymore."
"Truthful life is the most terrible thing.
And in social networks, that's a lot.
Feisbuke is less than in Instagram," she says.
The education of interior design and painting by A. Jagelavičiūtė says that sending a specific message on social networks is about women's emancipation.
It also advertises the production of journals and looks at creation in its work.
"I can't say that fashion magazine -- pure art expression, but I know that there's really a lot of it there.
I believe that there is a lot of creativity in my work, as well as vanity.
I'm balancing - that's my key to those big numbers.
I don't want to create a real life.
Wherever it is better to give people what they want, and quietly to inhale what they want themselves," believes Mrs Jagelavičiūtė.
One of the most challenging events that attract young people is classical music concerts.
Their popularity has been promoted through life history: to talk about vices, failures, and life experiences that remain authentic.
That is the strategy that Mrs Jaglevicuritė proposes to apply to the whole culture.
They say that culture does not have the opportunity to do anything about it, without any entertainment, and by showing true values.
"How about a boring teacher against students - is there a chance?
If we don't find a way to present this art without advertising, it's nothing.
When we're real and we're gonna raise the reader, maybe someone's going to change.
Once again, the second, the third, and the already dependent," she shared insights.
Three people caved in a helicopter in the island of Lithuania north of June
A search for three people took place in the north of June, Alaska, on Saturday after a helicopter accident.
One man was saved after a Friday disaster, and the other three failed to find him.
The helicopter crashed near the Lithuanian Gulf, north west of June.
It was found that it was "Airbus H125" on a long journey to Grand Prery Texas.
On Friday, 100 feet from the shore were detected.
According to Associated Press, one saved person was 14 m.
She was reported to have mild hypothermia, but there were no other problems.
Two adults and two adolescents are flying in the untied spleen.
According to the KTVA, David King (53 C.E.), Josh Pepperdas (42 C.E.) and Andrew Pepperda (11 C.E.) died.
It was found that the senior Pepperdas was the director of the building company of the Alliance of Davis Constructors & Engineers.
I don't know what caused the accident.
The National Transport Security Council stated that the investigation had been initiated.
"I'm going to blow up a helicopter, which was completely new – just received from the factory, two adults and two teenagers fly," says the report of the Coast Guard Officers, on the basis of the KTVA.
It was established that the pilot had 40 years of experience in the flight of fixed aircraft and helicopters, including flights in Alaska.
According to the Anchorage Daily News, family friend Jeff Brodsky said that the neighbors "have not lost hope that a miracle will happen".
With the help of the coast guard, the rescuers renewed on 17 February 2016 the search for alpineists from the Nevis Mountain Fort William, Scotland.
On Saturday, three people were searched for in Alaska after a helicopter accident.
"I've experienced sexual violence"
The president's advisor, Kellyanne'a Conway, exposed the sexual violence she had experienced on Sunday morning.
Conway noted the armed disputes between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh and his defendant Dr. Christine's Blasey Ford.
Conway, nervously, revealed that he had experienced sexual violence himself, and defended Mr Kavanaugh against the leader of Jake Tapper, claiming that the judge was guilty of sexual abuse while ignoring the adverse facts of the defendants.
"I am very touched by the victims of sexual abuse and violence.
I experienced sexual harassment," Conway said on Sunday at CNN State of the Union.
"I am a victim of sexual violence and I do not think that Judge Kavanaugh, Take's Tapper, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible for it.
We ourselves must be responsible for our conduct."
Conway said that the news network must be ashamed of Kavanaugh's comparison with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced last week to imprisonment in the state of Pennsylvania from three to ten years.
Conway also criticised the Senate Courts Committee because it was unable to eliminate former President Bill Clinton, who had engaged in oral sex in his office and lied to US people.
The survey showed that Kavanaugh’s and Ford’s evidence split the US society
The Americans do not agree on the evidence of Bretto Kavanaugh and his defendant Christine Blasey Ford – the defendant claims that the judge assaulted her sexually when they were teenagers.
The number of people who believe that Ford or Kavanaugh is lying is almost similar: 38 percent of respondents say that Kavanaugh was probably or undoubtedly lied by giving evidence, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Judicial Committee heard from both parties when Ford sent a letter to Senator Diane Feinstein to the judge in detail.
After delivering the letter, Ford and Kavanaugh said that he was ready to speak to the committee.
In giving evidence, Ford claimed that there were 100 percent true that in the beginning of the 9th century, he was trying to hug Kavanaugh rather than the other person.
In an emotional introductory language, 51 C.E., a woman said that she felt a civil duty, so she could not remain silent.
"I'm very scared," she said.
"I'm here because I think my civil duty is to tell me what happened to me when Bretta Kavanaugh and I went to high school."
Ford and two other women’s allegations of sexual abuse denied by Kavanaugh’s “never sexually assaulted anything in high school, college or any other time later”.
“All the way you tried to find something that would prevent you from voting for my nomination, no matter how unrealistic or crazy it is,” he said.
"That's the simplest thing I've ever done in the last minute."
On 27 and 28 September, YouGov's polls in which 2607 people were surveyed did not reflect the dispersal of the opinions of the different parties: Democratic parties believed for Ford (73 per cent) and Republicans (74 per cent), although Ford believed for more Republicans than for Kavanaugh (14 per cent compared to 11 per cent).
The founder of the Body Worlds exhibition called "Daktari Mortimi", wants to be intertwined and demonstrated in his own exhibition
A German scientist who invented plastinum died wants to become forever part of his exhibition Body Worlds.
Guntheris von Hagenas has developed an innovative method that allows for the demonstration of Lavons, Cows and Organs around the world in the exhibition, the expected and stunning, and conflicting assessments.
In 73 C.E., a man who died of cancer ordered his wife to plasticize him after his death to become a permanent exhibition at Body Worlds, which will be opened this week in London.
"In that sense, it will be the end of his life's work.
Now I understand that I will have to do this because I will express my appreciation and love," Angelina Whalley told The Observer.
She said that the man gave strict instructions on what to do with his lion, and the whole process would take about a year.
The muscles, nerves and arteries must be removed, and the body must be given silicone and constructed in the right position.
"He told me: "Angelina, it can freeze me for years to 25 degrees Celsius, but then you will have to add your hands, otherwise I'll die."
So I'm going to be able to do this for years, and then I'm going to have to do it."
Then, in the most ideal case, he will join the exhibition in the London pavilion next to other bodies that are hard on fixed posts, such as horse riding or playing cards.
Von Hagens boasted in the United Kingdom a broadcast through a direct British television broadcast (it was the first public broadcast in 170 years).
More than 47 million people have visited Body Worlds worldwide since 1995.
The founder of Body Worlds London, Peter Tabernalis, told The Guardian, that 100 percent of the exhibits, covering some 28,000 square feet, were exposed by the gifted people who "gived consent because they wanted to help the living, to light them up and to help them see possible problems".
“We see and read so many terrible things that we can escape death.
None of us will avoid it, death is common to us all, and I believe that Body Worlds shows that there is no need to be afraid," Tabernal said.
Ronaldo's lawyers threaten the court's action against the use of charges
On Friday, the Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo advocates said that he would bring to court a German journal published by the American "evidently illegal" claims that Ronaldo had taken it out in 2009.
One of Ronaldo's lawyers, Christian Schertz said that the article in the journal "Der Spiegel" was "an unacceptable statement of private accusations" and he would seek legal remedies for his client.
The application was sent to Reuters by Ronaldo, representative of Gestifute, in response to a request to comment on a Friday article published on the Internet.
Gestifute did not answer specific questions about the content of the Der Spiegel declaration, which Reuters could not self-test.
Der Spiegel first published charges in April 2017.
One of the most popular athletes in the world Ronaldo earned five times the title of the best player in the world.
This summer he went to the Youth of Italy from Real Madrid; the Italian club refused to comment on the statement of "Der Spiegel".
The report states that the alleged abuse occurred in the hotel room of Las Vegas in June 2009, as advocate of Kathryn Mayorga, Leslie's Mark Stovall, who filed charges.
Stovall told the magazine that Ronaldo and Mayorga had agreed in court.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality contract for Ronaldo's $375 000.
Stovall immediately did not respond to Reuters e-mails about comments, and Mayorga did not respond to calls on the home phone.
However, Stovall told the journal Der Spiegel that he had filed a civil complaint in order to cancel the confidentiality contract.
Mayorga told the journal Der Spiegel that the contract was no longer valid because she has so far felt the consequences of the night before nine years ago.
"I have survived a serious crisis," she said "Der Spiegel".
‘And yet, the charge of abuse.
I blame him and blame myself for signing this."
Sustainable business that ensures the independence of creators
Are you ready to try Self-Publishing 3.0?
The new White Paper, published today by the Union of Independents on the "#selfpub3.0" website, explains for the first time how to join other entrepreneurs, become independent and start a sustainable creation business.
The association of independent creators is the founder of Orna Ross, not the first to be recognized as one of the 100 most influential people in the publication, will explain at the Digital Book World 2018 conference why developers should allow the Self-Publishing 3.0 methods.
"The trends in reproduction, such as the popularization of personal trademarks, the responsible use and reading of mobile phones, together with digital publishing technologies, create a highly favourable environment for business-makers," says Ross.
However, only independent and creative thinkers and those who know their powers can benefit from these opportunities, which understand the value of intellectual property.
"#selfpub3.0" encourages developers to create several sources of employment through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and media.
It is possible to obtain from direct sales, subscriptions, concerted assistance, broadband models and other sources of income, such as online training and related activities.
"#selfpub3.0" also encourages the distribution of books in the most diverse formats for the wider audience using retailers and other services.
The main objective of "#selfpub3.0" is to encourage the change of thinking and learn to manage your creative business so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative asset, would not have been transferred to another company without any intention, e.g. specialised publishers or self-publishing service provider.
According to Ross, this is how creators can increase their income, influence and impact, and these methods must interest not only every digital age creator, but also publishers; it also stressed that real independence of creators (as well as other people) ensures commercial and creative freedom.
You'll be here by now.
And its prospects for independent creators are now the best.
The book Self-Publishing 1.0 describes the computer publishing and printing as required.
Self-Publishing 2.0 theme is the sale of e-books for readers and phones in online bookstores.
Now starts a new, Self-Publishing 3.0 era in which independent publishers will be taught to start a business of perspectives and sustainability.
The Union of Independent Creators is the only non-profit organization in the world, bringing together self-reliant authors.
The aim of the Union is to develop the skills of independent publishers, promote ethical activities, help start-ups to sell books and encourage creators to carry out a sustainable digital business that ensures their independence.
The presidents of the country and central bank warned the Italian government about the planned deficit
After hearing the populist government's plans to significantly increase the deficit expenditure next year, the President of Italy and the head of the central bank warned on Saturday that the country's debt had to be managed.
The ruling party (opposing movement of the Five Stars and the North League of the Right) presented a 2019 proposal for a deficit that would target 2.4 per cent of the total domestic product (GDP) and three times the previous administration target.
This report broke down the market on Friday and led to the sale of bonds and affected bank shares.
Furthermore, such plans are incompatible with the European Union, applying EU fiscal rules and monitoring their compliance.
Addressing the audience in the President's Chambers, which mentioned the 70-year anniversary of the constitution, President Sergio Mattarella said that, under the country's basic laws, "the budget must be balanced and debt must be managed".
"That's how we protect our citizens' savings," he said.
At a later central conference in Italy, the President of the Italian Bank said that Ignazio Visco could no longer increase the country's debt, which is the largest in all the economies of the European Union and is reaching 131 per cent of GDP.
"Italy must give priority to public and private investment and manage and reduce public debt," said Visco, on the basis of the Ansa public knowledge agency.
"School must be reduced consistently."
The Head of the Northern League and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvinis replied to Matarella's words that the debt had increased over the year by strict requirements applied by Brussels.
"Don't worry, Mr. President," said Salvinis in a statement.
"The debt of the government has been drained over the years by the European budgets that have been imposed on Europe. Finally, we are changing our plans and seeking a better future and growth."
Earlier, before speaking to Mattarella or Visco, the Five Star Movement Commander Luigi Di Maio said that before stealing money will be returned to people" from the budget, but added that the government did not intend to oppose the EU or financial markets.
The ruling parties have pressured a non-commissioned minister of the economy, Giovanni Tri, to support their planned deficit expenditure.
The Italian media claimed that Mattarella supported the Tria's failed attempt to maintain a budget deficit that would not account for 2% of GDP.
The presidents of the country and the central bank have no direct influence on economic policy.
At the age of 77, the President may dismiss the law and return it to Parliament, but only once.
Parliament can then again adopt an unaltered law and legislate it.
Official information: Indonesia's tsunami sensors missed a huge wave
The Indonesian geophysics agency withdrew the warning about the tsunami 34 minutes after its release, and later a severe earthquake occurred, sending a huge wave to the northeastern coast of the island of Sulaves, where hundreds of people were killed, and thousands were left homeless.
Automotive cranes after the tsunami of Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018
During the earthquake and tsunami of 7.5 degrees, about 1,500 km (940 miles) from the city of Jakarta, at least 384 people died.
On Sunday, the officials said that the number of victims was likely to increase.
On Friday, most people gathered at the festival on the beach of Palus, with a peak of six feet (18 feet) of death.
The geophysics agency BMKG called on the social media on Saturday: many people were wondering if the tsunami warning had been cancelled too early.
The Agency claimed that it had carried out the standard procedure and decided to withdraw the warning according to the data of the nearest flood sensor, approximately 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
“We do not have observation data from Palu.
We therefore had to take a decision according to the data we had," said BMKG, Head of the Earthquakes and Cunami Center, Rahmat Triyono.
The nearest sea level measurement of the sea was only determined by the "insignificant" wave of six centimeters (2.5 inches) and did not observe the huge waves near Paul.
“If we had had a floodgate near Paul or had received data from him, of course, it would have been better.
We have to think about this in the future," Triyon said.
According to officials, the tsunami hit Paul and the surrounding areas at a high speed — hundreds of miles per hour, but it is not clear whether it occurred before or after the warning was withdrawn.
The residents are checking the labs on the street looking for their family members after Cunami Paul, Indonesia, on 29 September 2018.
"We believe that the videos distributed in social media have taken place prior to the official cancellation of the warning," Triyon said.
Most of the damage caused by the 9.5th earthquake occurred on the second day of Christmas 2004 and caused a massive tsunami that killed some 226,000 people on the Indian coast, including 126 000 victims in Indonesia.
The picturesque city of Palu, where 380,000 people live, is located on the north side of the island of Sulaves in the north of the valley.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency (BNPB), the city was brutally destroyed in 1927 and 1968.
According to Geoffrey Baptiste Gomberto of Oxford University, the earthquake was not supposed to cause a tsunami.
On Friday the earthquake took place due to a horizontal break – the close tectonic plane collapsed horizontally rather than vertically, as usual for tsunamis.
"It is believed that the sea had been devastated by a great amount of water and caused the tsunami," he said, adding that the force of waves moving along the coast could be concentrated in the north of the island.
The representative of the disaster reduction agency Sutopo's Purwo's Nugroho's correspondents said that his team was "ready to send easy-to-understand public warnings" when the tsunami warning was immediately withdrawn.
According to the Ministry of Communications, the people had repeated text messages with warnings, but Nugroho's claimed that due to the earthquake, electricity and communications lines were stopped and there were no sirens on the border.
The Indonesian social media doubted whether the BMKG had to withdraw the tsunami warning, and it was bad that the information had not been provided in time.
"I'm disappointed... the warning was revoked... and the tsunamis still happened..." – Twitter user @zanogucci sent a direct message to BMKG.
Golf: Mollywood duet is about to drop ticket sales records
On Saturday, the fourth match, Francesco's Molinaris and Tommy's Fleetwood became the first two from Europe, I will win all four pairs of matches, and will most likely be recorded in history, because representing Europe is the first result of 10:6 before the Ryder Cup final.
After defeating Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau, they became the first European couple to win all four cats.
Only the Americans Larry's Nelson and Lanny's Wadkins were able to do this in 1979.
The alarming results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – do not show everything.
Three times the couple won 14 important titles for Woods and twice won over Patrick Reed.
They also sought victory against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas – this week's US team won three more matches.
Molinaris and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans to win five points out of five possibilities in the weekly competitions.
Fleetwood has already earned mostly points in the competitions of Ryder Cup units as a new European.
The couple, who will have a lot of new diseases by the Mollywood industry, did not seem to be able to lead Europe's teams forward from the outset.
From Ryder's Cup of Young People, such as Fleetwood, there is no hope of such an event, and Molinaris won none of the previous six matches and lost the four rivals.
However, there was hope: Fleetwood was the first in Europe last year, known as Le Golf National Square as its five fingers and won the French Open tournament here in 2017 and demonstrated a strong temper during this year's U.S. Open.
Molinaris is a new British Open champion and many are considered the most consistent player in the European tournament – this is a useful feature on the ground floor where high grass can lead to loss, as demonstrated by American failure.
These players' features and harmonious play on the platform made them ineffective.
"Now I feel a little sensitive, but only on Saturday," said the cheerleader Fleetwood, all weekend playing with a broad smile.
This afternoon we had a great show, played stable and good.
If we go along with history, it will be a special achievement.
I'm just glad we made it to the team."
The moliners were happy too.
"It was great to play with Tommy," he said.
"But we must fulfil our duty, not just to access the records, so tomorrow we will have to fight hard for 4.5 points that we need to win; it will not be easy."
Ritter's hot!
Irish village in the middle of the war
The Claregalway castle in the west of Ireland was once powerful, the main fortress of the 15-year-old family from England and this Saturday was remembered for its origin.
Riterio's two-legged sword during the Middle Ages War Festival in Claregalway Castle in Golf, Ireland, on September 29, 2018.
A completely restored Anglo-Norman period home with a box has been turned into a middle-class battlefield, where many enthusiasts from all corners of the world have replayed contact fights and games that were popular many centuries ago.
As a result, Karl Dornan and Dornan, dressed in the Ritery, are patrolling Donna Dornan in Claregalway Castle in the great art of the Middle Ages War Festival in Golf, Ireland, on September 29, 2018.
"This is a great weekend's journey and something unusual," said Denise Fitzgerald from Kerry's graphics, "and the weekend's going to be at home.
"That is how we returned to the simplest things.
I'm trying to do everything I can," said the theatre worker, for the first time participating in the war festival.
In the field there were genuinely shielded fighters, and although their swords were a book, some of the colds were glued, and one injured the mouth.
The riders demonstrated their skill by driving and cutting their hats and bazaars across the board.
The metal rods were used to carry weapons, and the handcuffs were prepared for medicine, and the craftsman’s belt and wool were dyed.
The participants, who were very determined and well - versed, tried to get involved in the role.
"I think anyone can wear a costume, but the touch on the role is art," said Helena Stackpoole, who played Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald and had the unique opportunity to use her fashion design knowledge.
“All costumes are handmade.
I've been wearing my belt for two years, and now I'm wearing a dress, and I'm only wearing 800 beads on her hands alone.
It matters to me," she said.
After earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of fish increased to 832
According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency, the number of people killed by earthquakes and tsunamis on the Indonesian island increased by 832 each week and the affected area was higher than originally thought.
The Agency's representative, Sutopo's Purwo's Nugroho's at the news conference, said that many people were struck in the cracks after the 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and a six-foot (20 ft) high tsunami wave.
The FBI referred to the second woman charged with Kavanaugh
FTB agents investigating the U.S. Supreme Court of Bretto Kavanaugh’s case referred to the second woman charged with sexual assault, which was released on Sunday by this woman’s lawyer.
Mr Ramirez's report by Advocate John Clune states that the investigation of the FTB's case will not only cover separate charges in an attempt to prosecute the defendant Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford of the Federal Court of Appeal presented this week at a dramatic Senate meeting.
Ramirez blames Kavanaugh for showing her his fifth in the evening, where he was drunk and who was in the college of Jelio University when they both studied there.
U.S. President Donald Trumpas presented the press of the proper Senate Republicans and instructed the FTB to conduct a study after a Thursday Senate meeting, where Professor Ford of the University of California filed detailed accusations that Kavanaugh was trying to get her out in the evening, in 1982, when they both attended school and were teenagers.
On Saturday, NBC News reported that the White House limited the scope of the FTB investigation.
A short time later, he denied and announced the message "Twitter" saying, "I really want them to question all the people they need in their opinion."
The representative of the White House, Rajas Shahs, said that the Senate had determined the extent and duration of the FTB study (the study should be completed weekly).
"The White House allows agents to do what they are taught," Shahs said.
The United Kingdom will not withdraw environmental or animal protection standards after Brexit
Environment Minister Michael Gove said on Sunday that the United Kingdom would not return to environmental or animal protection standards so that after Brexit it could enter into trading.
The Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of Britain, Michael Gove, arrives at Downing Street in London on 24 September 2018.
Speaking at the annual Conservatories' Conference, Gove said that the United Kingdom would benefit from being aware of its quality food products and the government will publish this year's food strategy.
Europe has returned the Ryder Cup in unit competitions
Francesco's Molinaris won the award on Sunday by returning the Ryder Cup to Europe: italian won Phil Mickelson at 16 and earned a score of 14.5.
Mickelson went to the diocese after the first ball was released into the water, and the driver was able to stay in the driveway, Molinaris became the first European, and I won all five cats a week, although none of the previous six won.
The European victory has already been ensured that Italy launches the strike from the starting point and the ground victory lacks one point, while Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia have been the first of the cats and was at least half a point certain.
At the beginning of the day, they took the lead in 10:6 and had to earn four and a half points of potential 12, so as to be able to return the trophies and secure their accommodation in the homes that have existed since 1993.
Before that, the team only managed to eliminate the difference between four points and win the unit contests: this was done by the US team in 1999 in Brooklyn and Europe in 2012 in the Medino miracle contests, but no one believed in another surprising return.
Justin Thomas, Webbs Simpson and Tony's Finau gave Jim Fury's team the hope of winning the first cats, but then the European team hit points across the platform.
Thorbjornas Olesena interrupted Jordan Spieth, and his teammate John Rahmas – Tiger Woods: 14 important titled athletes lost four out of four.
The best player recognized by Ryder Cup player Ian Poulter waited for what better, mostly ovation this week, when the world's best player Dustin Johnson left him at the 18th Rising Square and brought Europe closer to victory.
Then it had to wait, which mother would finish first, and it was Molinar's game, brought forth the joy wave in the minima, which was the greatest event in history.
RT World News: German policemen protecting Erdogan used the neo-Nazi name as a code word
According to local media, secret officials in eastern Germany, Turkey's President Erdogan, who was protected this week during his visit to Berlin, used the name of a sad-tempered neo-Nazi extremist.
The Ministry of the Interior of the region has stated that the criminal police of the East Saxonyian Land Police are investigating two members of the elite anti-terrorist camp in Germany.
Men were meant to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his long-term trip to Germany.
Officials had to work secretly, so the protocol required the use of a code name.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt, a sadly exalted neo-Nazi belonging to a group of extremists (NSUs), who at the beginning of this age killed eight immigrants from Turkey, one Greek citizen and a German police officer.
The local media reports that a different code name has been known when two police officers have asked for permission to obtain the internal documents necessary to carry out the task.
The officers in charge immediately withdrew the police.
The first commander of the Saxon criminal police, Petrica Kleine, responded to news.
He said that the decision to use Boehnhardt's name was "should have been the stupidest" and thus "obviously ignored victims and their loved ones".
Mr Roland Walleris, Minister for the Interior of Saxony, endorsed this statement and called the decision "a fool, a cowardly and totally unacceptable one".
Erdogan’s Friday visit to Berlin led to many conflicting assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticised for adopting the leader who was accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said that this visit is very important, "in the event of disagreements, they need to be resolved in person".
The public first heard about the NSU in 2011, when the bodies of Boehnhardt and his colleague Uwe's Mundlos were found in an apartment in eastern Germany.
One of them was thought to have killed the other and then killed after the failed attempt to overthrow the bank in Eizenach city.
Soon the third member of the NGO group, the last surviving Beata'a Zschaepe.
In July this year, the German court sentenced her to death for 10 crimes.
She refused to contribute to the murder, but her lawyer claimed that the accused felt moral guilt because he did not try to stop the murderers.
Following the NSU scandal, the German security agencies have come under a lot of criticism.
Lawmakers, activists and victims believe that the group had much more partners.
It has also been shown that the German Internal Intelligence Agency has infiltrated many informants into the NSU and has consistently prevented the investigation of the murder, attempted murder and robbery associated with the group.
Muskas withdraws from the post of Head of Tesla and will have to pay $20 million fines to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elonas Muskas has agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, giving it to the court on the fraud of Twitter, in which he claimed to be making Tesla a private company.
The Muscus will have to withdraw from the duties of the Director, but the Director-General will remain.
The documents of the Agreement indicate that Muskas must be removed from the duties of the President of the Council of Tesla within 45 days and shall be prohibited from returning to these duties for three years.
In addition, he will have to pay $20 million.
It all started with a message from Twitter, which was inadvertently or inadvertently wrong, so Muskas will have to get confirmation in advance by saying something about Tesla in any form, including, but not limited to, social media records (e.g. Twitter), company website (e.g. company website), press releases and calls to investors).
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million, because it didn't match Musko's original Twitter message.
On 7 August, Muska was accused of misleading investors in Twitter, where he claimed to have obtained money to make Tesla a private company, one of which would be $420 – therefore the company's securities amounted to more than 10 percent.
Muska quickly withdrew his words by saying that Tesla would remain public, and robbed investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission decided that Musko's initial statement "was unfair and misleading because it did not find the facts".
Muskas himself explained that this error could be justified: after meeting with the Independent Property Fund in Saudi Arabia, he felt that he had been able to agree on the funds.
It is reported that Musku and the Securities and Exchange Commission have drawn closer to the lower penalty – Musku should have refused the president's position for only two years and should not have been guilty, but Muska has refused this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday, the price of Tesla's securities fell and was likely to change his opinion again and agreed with the stricter conditions.
However, under the new agreement, as well as under the old one, Musku does not have to admit the blame for the error of investors.
The Alexandrian Patriarch undertook to support the canonical Church of Ukraine and called for Orthodox unity
The Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria stated on the basis of the canonical Orthodox Church of Ukraine belonging to the Patriarchate of Moscow.
He spoke in response to the separation of the Russian Orthodox Church and Constantinople Patriarchate.
On Thursday, Theodore II arrived in the city of Odessa in southern Ukraine and met with the highest church representatives and trusted Orthodox.
The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected Orthodox hierarchies, leading only to the ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.
"I am coming to tell you: do not give up Orthodox faith and canonical church," said Patriarch Theodore II.
Prior to his visit to Odessa, he met with the Mayor of the Polish Orthodox Church of Savva, who also supports the canonical Church of Ukraine.
They also called for the prevention of conflicts arising from attempts to justify the autonomy of the Ukrainian Church.
"We will always support those seeking orthodox unity," said Theodore II.
The Orthodox Church recently survived a major crisis following the decision of Constantinople Patriarchate to recognise the independence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.
The latter belongs to the Orthodox Church of Russia, also called the Moscow Patriarchate.
Constantine decided to send exarchus to Kiev, thus violating the rule prohibiting one Orthodox church from interfering with other matters.
Exzarchai are special patriarchal representatives who formally occupy a position higher than the Metropolitan Onufry, who is the current head of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine belonging to the Patriarchate of Moscow.
The Moscow Patriarchate took a bad view of the actions of Constantinople and dismissed all the church’s common customs and members’ organisations, which were led or jointly chaired by the representatives of Constantinople.
However, it is claimed that this decision has warned Constantinople not to take other opposing actions and that the two churches have completely discontinued the link.
Of the three churches in Ukraine, only one of the churches of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine belongs to the Patriarchate of Moscow.
Most Ukrainian clergy recognize its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the separate churches – the Orthodox Church belonging to the Patriarchate of Kiev, which emerged in the 10th century.
This religious movement even has a patriarchal leader, Filaret, to recognize the Orthodox Church, complete independence and equality with the Patriarchate of Moscow.
Damascus opened the main trade transition in Syria-Jordan for the first time in three years
According to the SANA State News Agency, the Syrian government has claimed to open a border crossing between Nasiba and Jordan, which has been closed for three years for war action in this territory.
This can be done because the fighters on the Syrian side left the land to Daraa.
Nasiba is a major trade link not only between neighbouring countries, but also between the Gulf of Lebanon and Persia.
Most important thoughts from the United Nations language of Lavrov
While attending the UN Foreign Minister Sergeius Lavrovos attacked the West on the "political blackmail and brutal force" and said that diplomacy should not be given to dictatorship and unilateral sanctions.
At the UN General Assembly on Friday, the Minister said that some Western countries, in their attempt to maintain "the position of world leaders themselves", put pressure on others without conscience.
He did not mention specific countries, but said they were using "political blackmail, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world must pay a high price for the selfish ambitions of the small group of countries.
Lavrov, a ten-year representative of Russia, said at the meeting that diplomacy and negotiation culture change the dictatorship and unilateral sanctions applied without the approval of the UN.
The Minister said that the sanctions imposed by many countries are "illegal or ineffective" and recalled the embargo imposed by the United States for many years.
"But history has not paid us anything," said Lavrova and added that "the Westerners are only willing to bear the blame if it is "very likely".
We remember how often such unwarranted accusations were justified by interference and wars, such as the 1999 explosions in Yugoslavia, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 invasion of Libya."
Of course, Lavrov did not mention all the Western invasions and recalled the seven-year-old Syrian war as one of the latest cases.
A failed attempt by extremists to overthrow the Damascus regime could be fatal to the whole country and open the way for the creation of "terrorist calibate".
Lavrova praised the Astana peace process, which was launched jointly by Russia, Turkey and Iran, and claimed that this process helped prevent the Islamic State (ISI) (formerly ISIS) and other groups that wanted to capture Syria as a whole.
It is now most important to rebuild the country's places of war and help refugees return safely to their homes.
Lavrov returned to the battle of great forces and said that the UN was actually created "to learn from the Second World War".
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia recalled that in 2018, 80 years from 1938, the "gloating" Treaty of Munich, which France and the United Kingdom agreed to allow the German-occupied part of Czechoslovakia to accede to Hitler, to the Germans.
Although then British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said that the Munich Treaty "will bring peace to these times", the war began a year later.
"Munchen's betrayal" shows how far "the country's selfishness and disregard of international law can lead," Lavrov said.
"The dictatorship of the colonial era and the coercion must be helped in the history archive or assemblage."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the problems of the world, Lavrov said.
"If you have any questions or doubts, sit down and talk, reveal the facts, listen to your colleagues' arguments and try to reconcile interests."
Krislas, do we light up our eyes?
RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are being turned into fog, and Bibi's finger is turning to Iran.
The President of Israel, in the United Nations General Assembly language, claimed that Tehran has hidden nuclear weapons.
It may be that the accused Israelite himself is hiding something.
The favorite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has released the news on Thursday, showing highly photographed photos with places where Iran is likely to consider nuclear materials.
Tehran replied without delay that Tel Avivas would rather take care of his "undeclared nuclear weapons programme".
Although Israel never admitted (but did not deny) having nuclear weapons, RT journalist Muradas Gazdiev tried to find out if Tel Aviva should actually look for a scar in his eye.
Scottish Government: Before January, no complaints about Alexo Salmondo
The Scottish Government claimed that no complaints concerning Alexo Salmondo were recorded by January this year.
In January, the former prime minister was charged with two charges of sexual harassment, although he strongly denied them.
In March, he was notified of the investigation.
Salmonda, who resigned from the Scottish national party, was in a position with the Scottish government because of the complaint process.
In reply to the claim that one complaint was first examined in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaints had been filed before January.
A representative of the Scottish government said: “In January, the Scottish government received two complaints about Alexo Salmondo.
We could ignore them or hide them.
Earlier that year, the Deputy Prime Minister did not hear any complaints about Alexo Salmondo and, as we have already said, the Prime Minister first heard about the investigation from Alexo Salmondo in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legality of our processes and we will firmly defend our position.
The Scottish Government will endeavour to obtain as much information as possible in the time available.
However, as we have already mentioned, for legal reasons, we cannot comment on the case of Mr Salmondo any more now."
The representative of Alexo Salmondo said: “We are not going to mind anything, because our petition against the permanent secretary is now being discussed at the courtroom and we hope that a decision will be taken soon.
We'll talk in court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish government's complaint procedure against Alex is illegal."
The painting shook the Dragons with the result 29:13: "Warriers" played Lee Jones's shot
Glazgas returned the winner's title in the Guinness Pro14 league by winning additional points and winning the Dragons Scottstown stadium, while coach Dave Rennie's is not blind to the satisfaction, but he believes that the game could be more accurate.
After the unexpected loss of the Southern Kings team in Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie's highly changed teams asked to try and although she was able to collect the necessary points so that she could remain at the top of the A conference, the windy and rainy air-fighting matches were not really bright.
"I think we had a great fight tonight, played on the right side of the square, and our strategy was good," Rennie's said.
“We have to play more precisely and we could take advantage of more opportunities.
The conditions were not favourable.
We have created many opportunities, and we are happy to do so.
You need to play more precisely, but 40 or 50 points won today would not have been a good result.
We had to try.
We won additional points, but we have to make more effort next week to play home with Zebre and next week with Saracens in Europe."
Although the air was windy, the Glazgo team soon began to earn points, but TMO held all the lost balls of Huwo Jones, including his captured internal transmission of Niko Matawal in the left corner.
Disillusionment did not last long: the left column Olis Kebble's fourth minute fell in the middle, and Adam Hastings easily caught the shot.
Dragons reduced the difference when Arwels Robson was fined, and safe turned the other player immediately after 20 minutes of mark and bells earned a point.
The match after the rather peaceful first side escaped after almost half an hour: the Glazgo attackers consistently attacked the Dragons line, then the judge from South Africa Stuart Barry's 22 minutes fined the guests for being on the side of Hastings.
"Warriers" was released to the graves, but lost the ball after a smooth transfer, because a few left-handed hits were unable to control the ball and it was transferred to the left.
The second test took place two minutes after the interval: Hastings broke the Dragons line and wisely passed the ball to the abandoned Lee Jones.
The dome was returned to Hastings' position and the result of the gamers became 12:6.
The first minute on the second side of the slide was very successful: Alex Dunbar’s bullet was hit by Lee Jones for the second test, and Hastings helped him.
However, Warriers did not succeed – just four minutes ago they took the ball in the middle of the square and the Dragon Center, Adam Warren, pushed it through the door, making points, and then took Josh Lewis after an open game with Robson.
Warriers quickly returned to the leading position and the 54th minute after the fourth test earned additional points when Huwas Jones escaped to the right, and Hastings failed to pass the ball (it was the third failure of four tests).
The painting maintained a comfortable higher position and, after a few minutes, did the fifth test – Dunbara passed the ball after the harvest with George Horne, and Hastings earned points.
Kebble's published as the best match player, but Rennie's fought Hastings.
"They obviously stopped us from playing, but we're in the middle," said the coach.
“He missed a few meters, but he was skilful and still managed to distance himself.
He's in good shape and trusts himself."
"Ayr United" won by Morton 1:5: the five stars "Ayr" interrupted the master team
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore won two prizes, and Declan McDaids added one more and thus helped "Ayr" to stay on top of the championship table.
"Ayr" drove forward after Shankland's invasion, intruded from six yards after Michael Rose's round beat to McDaid.
In the 35th minute of the first test, Charlie's Telefera took the ball from the double Robbie's Crawford on his own site and sent it to the bottom of the mirror through the "Ayr" container of Ross Doohan to the far shore.
The players from Grinoka's fourth quarter had a chance to get ahead when Doohan was beating Gary Oliver, but Michael Tiderser launched a weak penalty, which was easily captured by the consumer.
The 74th minute of "Ayr" was the second time the rivals crossed when the transfer of the replacement Craig McGuffie's long distance was fired into the air and dropped onto the ground was sent to the doors of another replacement player Craig Moore.
Moore's transferred the ball the same minute to Shankland, who entered 17 this season.
To the fans at dawn, Moore came back to his side a quarter from the edge of the square, and McDaid sent a hot ball to the door.
Alloa and Falkirk matches ended with 0:2: the first victory of young people in league
"I'm glad, I feel relief, I'm happy," said Ray's McKinnon after the very first Falkirk victory league and the season's winning points.
"Rangers" loaned by the attacker Zakas Rudden (18th century) won after the entry into both quarters and pushed the team of the owners "Alloa Athletic" into the bottom of the championship and released the club from the pressure.
"It was an important game for us," said McKinnon.
"In the last three competitions we probably earned more, so it was good to make three points in the situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
It wouldn't have made a difference, but it was important for us to win."
In the 26th minute, Rudden sent the ball to Patrick Brook and earned a take from the door line in the middle of the second basement, when Demantas Petravičius slowly blew the ball over the consumer Neil Parry.
"We wanted to make a firm statement, but failed," acknowledged Mr Goodwin, Head of the Wasps.
Hearts Sickness petition for semi-final received more than 11,000 signatures
The Hearts Sickness petition for the Betfred cup semi-final schedule has been signed by more than 11,000 people.
She is upset about the decision to hold both semi-finals on the same day and at the same stage.
As advised by the Scottish police, SPFL decided last week to hold the "Aberdeen"–Rangers" event at 12:00 and "Hearts–“Celtic – 19:45, as well as the "Jambos" and "Dons" intruders.
The Evening News, together with Aberdeen Evening Express, asked for a fair solution for the victims on Saturday.
The so-called Super Saturday decision was also condemned by Aberdeen and Hearts: both clubs issued statements that criticise the journal.
A request was made on Thursday at the change.org website, which requires one of the players to move to another place or date.
A man accused of murdering two women in Kent's neighborhood
Two women, the sixth and the eighth, died in a place of crime.
According to police representatives, another man, as well as having crossed the 70-year-old boundary, is in hospital and is stable.
The 28-year-old living on the same street will be arrested and will be tried on Monday for two murders and one attempt to kill the Magistrates at a session in which he will be involved in video communication.
The police haven't named the victims yet, but they think they knew the suspect.
The neighbors said that they were shocked by such an event in the village, which they said was “silent and friendly”.
At 31st, Sophie Moorey-Brown, Press Association, said: "We live here for five years and never heard of any bad events – it is always very quiet and nice to live here."
Royal archives and music "Hamilton" creator of the world light about King Jurg III
After the Queen presented the project, during which a large archive of documents collected in the year of the reign of George III was opened, it was hoped that letters, journals and languages would help the public to get to know the kings of thought.
Now these documents will reach a different audience – the Royal Archives decided to work with the music of Vestenda completely unexpected.
The academics who wanted to reveal the true face of the king invited the musician "Hamilton" Jurg III, an actor, to review key documents from the time of the Queen's proprosol management.
Researchers are trying to make old handcuffs available to a wider audience, and thus a host of fans will be able to obtain digital documents.
Members of the royal family have already publicly supported the music creation, and the Shesex hero and hercogen will watch twice, although Prince Harry’s father is constantly shown on stage.
Michael Jibson, acting as king in the West, said that the documents had to be considered and helped to identify the king whose image was composed by the audiences by the musician "Hamilton", the film "King George's impromptuity" and the series for children "Student History".
"We fell in love with beautiful letters"
US President Donald Trump did not create enthusiasm after trying to reduce the tension with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unu and on Saturday at his sponsors' meeting, he said that after writing letters, they "in love".
Mr Shortas and Mr Kim said that they would pursue the Middle Korean nuclear disarmament – this was discussed at the unprecedented meeting that took place in Singapore this year.
Before moving to a new phase of history after many years of public disagreements, the leaders of the countries changed with threats and insults because North Korea wanted to create a nuclear missile capable of reaching the United States.
“I was as strict as he was.
We always promised," said Mr. Trump at the meeting in West Virginia.
"And then we fell in love, you know?
In fact, he wrote me beautiful, beautiful letters."
Lekavičius and Panathinaikas entered the Greek Cup semifinal
The Athens Panathinaikas in the Greek Cup's fourth final match won the victory without any further effort by Luke Lekaviči.
As a result of the Athens team's departure 76:68 (29:24, 17:15, 15:11, 15:18) won the Patr "Prometheus" team.
Lithuania spent 14 minutes in the square, earned 4 routes (2/2 twice), recovered one ball and performed one transfer of results and went twice.
As a result, Nick Calathes, who won 15 points, competed alongside the Panathinaikas.
Skverneil kirt for Šimonyte: everything decided by the party's "breath"
Prime Minister Saulis Skvernelis said that there was a lack of democracy in the internal election of conservators, and the party's leadership actually appointed Ingrid Šimonyta as the candidate for presidents.
"The feast of "democracy" was always strange, mildly saying when the party screamed, the top decided and actively supported one candidate.
Probably there was no chance of winning the second candidate even theoretically," S. Skvernelis told reporters in the government
"The Conservatives have appointed their candidate, with that and we welcome them," the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister of the Green States said that I. Shimonyta should be evaluated by voters, remembering her work in the Government of Andria Kubilius.
Mr Skvernelis has not yet commented on whether he will participate in the presidential elections.
The Lithuanian State and Green Union intends to approve its candidate next year.
The leader of the ruling "states" Ramūnas Karbauski's conservative election called the "unsuccessful experiment" because of the low-party activity.
"First of all, we need to congratulate the experiment that has not completely succeeded.
There were only 55% of the party members, in total only about 20,000 voters.
Knowing what money was needed to be issued to organize those elections, it is clear that it was not true," said R. Karbauskis to the Delfi.lt news portal.
"I don't think that the cost will be the result, because the result is no, the party decided that their candidate was such - all right, but who to spend so much money," he added.
During the weekend of the internal elections, 79% of the members of the Conservative Party and their supporters voted in favour of the Šimonytės candidacy.
Lithuanian wages make fun of the Estonians: one area can change everything
According to the Baltic Salary Survey survey carried out this year by the company organizing the remuneration survey, the wage was mainly increased in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia have left their neighbours a little behind, written in the company's press release.
"After surveying 850 companies and examining the changes in remuneration in the Baltic countries, we see that monthly remuneration before taxes this year increased by 81.8% in Lithuania and on average increased by 7.7%, and annual pay with additives by 10.5%.
Latvia has given us a small amount of annual salary here, but as in Estonia, a smaller number of employees compared to our country," says Povil Blusius, a representative of the company that conducts the studies, and adds that in the context of such wage growth trends, the economic indicators of the country that dictate them should also be taken into account.
In Estonia, wages are rising at the fastest rate
Although the salaries in Latvia and Estonia were lower for the workers than in Lithuania, the increase was higher.
In Latvia, the annual salary rose by 71% of the employees of the companies surveyed and reached more than 11% in our country.
In Estonia this year's salary rose by 73 per cent and averaged 13 per cent.
There is also a significant impact on wage growth trends on the exchange of workers, as changing jobs can be much higher than in the previous job.
For those who have not changed their jobs in Lithuania in recent years, the annual salary increased by 8.8% - more often than in other Baltic countries.
In the neighbouring Latvia, the annual wage increase for such workers was 3.6 per cent.
Estonia remains a leader in the Baltic countries, not only as an average wage for new, but also for long-term workers.
In the absence of changes in jobs or duties, the pay was the fastest: monthly - 6%, annual, including additives - up to 9%.
According to the remuneration expert, such trends often depend on, or are combined with, the overall economic indicators of the country: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, state monetary policy, prevailing market conditions.
For example, forecasts of a coming economic crisis encourage business to behave more cautiously, less investment.
The emerging and fastest-growing sectors of the country, such as information technology, construction and pharmaceuticals, can also generate common statistics and reduce developments.
Maximum tax burden for Latvians
In relation to wage growth, it is important to take account of the different tax systems in these countries.
In Latvia, employees pay the largest share of taxes - even 31 or 34%, which may increase to 42.4 per cent of those who earn more.
This is a permanent 24% rate in Lithuania, so in the case of higher wage growth in Latvia, employees can expect the same or even less sensitive gain as in Lithuania.
In Estonia, the tax rate is equal to 23.6 per cent in Lithuania, so in this country we find the most favourable labour tax in the Baltic countries.
In the field of IT - the most competitive rewards
According to the survey, in all the Baltic countries almost independent of the level of duty, IT specialists' positions remain among the best paid.
The opposite is the case in retail trade - the market indices in this area are one of the smallest, so employees earn less than the average market income.
In comparison with previous years, the most rapid wage for engineering specialists in higher positions and risk management professionals has been raised.
Such a rise in remuneration did not take place this year, and some IT positions - a large part of the organisation's information security expertise increased monthly remuneration to up to 14 per cent.
In the meantime, the wage in retail trade has not changed much.
However, some companies have successfully carried out reorganizations of remuneration systems, thus raising the annual salary due to the premiums by about 2 per cent.
According to the remuneration specialists, there is a noticeable tendency that wage growth dictates the needs of the specialists who are asked - the demand for system analysts continues to grow in the Baltic States.
Ariana Grande suffers again: the former promises don't fail to smile
After the divorce with Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson sheds his pain by creating loopholes about their relationship.
Participating on Saturday Night Live, he chose to laugh about how fast he acts into serious relationships.
Ladies and gentlemen speak that the truth, apparently just three weeks ago, Ariana and Pete canceled their vows, which occurred just after a few months of knowledge.
Pete's tried to create scenarios that mentioned his unsatisfying relationships, but it's going to happen on screen a little later.
It turns out that from her former relationship, the humourist is emboldening Ariana himself.
Such a kiss is painful to her and not to her heart.
At least that's how TMZ told the foreign news portal.
White or red: what the dietologist recommends to choose sugar
Baltasis on the ground?
Which sugar can I pick?
During the polling centres, it has become clear that although Lithuanians are still traditionally collecting white sugar, the fact that many nations have completely rejected the ingredient of white death is surprising.
The fact that red sugar sales are growing does not hide the representatives of the trading networks.
According to the "Maximos" representative, red sugar is becoming more and more popular and the people buy it more and more, although the usual white sugar - by choice is even more and more.
It also grows and organic sugar sales grow in specialised organic products stores.
One of the most popular products there is coconut sugar.
According to Dietologist Dalios Vaitkevičiūt, the main difference is the price, and the harmful effect on health may have on both.
"The raw unrefined sugar is three times more expensive, but in terms of health, these sugars have been added to the body, using their surpluses," said D. Vaitkevičiūtė.
To live without diabetes, the dietologist advises to reduce its daily levels gradually.
This is the result - the benefit of the whole economy - falls and undesirable kilograms, improved and health.
By consistently using less sugar, it will be easier to give up everything.
"Every custom we form is about a month, so after doing such an experiment, let's say it takes a month to drink some product without sugar, coffee or tea, we'll see how positive this will be and I think we can all give up a little bit of effort," said an idetologist.
Doctors claim that the presence of white blood sugar does not necessarily cause diabetes, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases.
It is therefore worth trying to consume it as little as possible, in the sense that this product is added to many food products, even to food.
Another "Little Cable" step: Lipkevich lends to other LKL teams
The team of the Paneveži Lietkabeli team welcomed Vytien Lipkeviči - the attacker borrows the Prienų Skycop team.
During this Betsafe-LKL season, V.Lipkevičius entered 6.4 points in 22 minutes, recovered 2.8 balls, performed 2 successful transfers and collected 8.5 points of utility.
FIBA Champions League 29 year 198 cm high score statistics reached 3,8 points, 2,5 points down ball, 1,5 results transfer and 4,8 points of utility during the 21 minute game.
In the near future, Lietekabelis will announce a new purchase that will strengthen its composition.
S. Buškevics joined the training staff
The commander's team of Lietkabeli, Nenado Chanak's assistant, has become a well-known Lithuanian assistant, Sandis Bushevics.
41st Latvian year 2005-2006 season played Vilnius "Lithuanias in the morning", and in 2014-2017 worked in this club's system as a male trainer.
Last season S. Buškevics trained Jekabpils team.
The sports director Jonas Vainauskas invited Stephana Babraska to the headquarters, but he still intends to continue his career.
The invitation was also received by Vytenis Jasikevich, but it was not possible to reach agreement on both sides.
S. Buškevicas will work with Robert Kuncaiči and Algimanta Bruzu at the Litekabeli training station.
Latvia will join Lietkabel on Tuesday and will be in the Cido arena during the FIBA Champion League match with Dijon USA, but on the floor we will not develop it as registration ended 24 hours before the start of the match.
The reduction in biofuel prices is not suitable for all
In order to reduce biofuel prices, more leaf trees will be transferred to Lithuania in 2019, says the Minister of the Environment.
According to Kęstučio Navicko, this is how you want to "oppress" biofuel prices.
"We have a great set of certain types.
The balance (...) must be balanced.
The concentration in soft leaves is because this is how we can affect the prices of biofuels," said Mr. Navickas on Tuesday, presenting the situation of deforestation.
According to Navicko, this year the price of wood increased by about 20% in Lithuania.
According to the Minister, in the next year the shells will be destroyed as much as this year and the eels will be about 80 hectares lower.
According to him, in Lithuania, more wood is cut off because of favourable natural conditions.
"It should not be next year," said Mr. Navicks.
Today, 10.2 million ha are state-owned forests and 800 thousand ha are private.
Fighting food prices - a certain obligation: to encourage buying only in your area
The proposed obligation for national authorities and organisations to buy 50% of the food from local producers to reduce the prices of the measures presented by the Ministry of Agriculture is announced by the news portal 15min.lt.
"The law would apply not only to small traders operating in the regions but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or office goods could also be supplied to the buyer in municipalities by successful local companies," said Minister Virginius Sinkevičius on the portal.
The president of the association of meat processors Egidijus Mockevicius is of no doubt that this provision would discriminate against the part of entrepreneurs, and it would also be difficult to check whether the law is not used by the buyers.
The measure of inconsistency is also criticised by the Head of the Business Confederation of Sotkus.
Macron calls for Europe to defend against Russia and the United States
French President Emmanuel Macronas invited on Tuesday to create a "real European army" with the possibility of protecting against Russia and even the United States
Mr Macron, calling for the creation of a common force in the European Union from his entry into power, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on American military power.
In recent years, he has gained a weighting argument when US President Donald Trump announced that Washington will withdraw from the significant Cold War Treaty on Nuclear Power.
"We must protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States," - E. Macron told the radio "Europe 1".
This is the first interview given to his radio from the position of the President of the Labour Force in May 2017.
"What do I see as President Shortas announces that he is drawn from an important disarmament treaty created after the 9th decade of a crisis of rockets in Europe, which will be the main victim? - Europe and its security," said the French leader.
The above-mentioned missile crisis has resulted in the development of non-strategic nuclear weapons, which were launched by the United States in Europe by ballistic missiles at the end of the Cold War.
This crisis was a major factor in encouraging the United States and the Soviet Union to conclude a medium-range nuclear power contract (INF) in 1987.
"We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army," said E. Macronos in an interview, recorded last Monday in Verden, northeastern France, to the President of the First World War fighting sites this week before the end of this conflict.
According to E. Macrono, in this situation, "the fact that Russia, which is near our borders, has demonstrated that there is a potential danger... we need a Europe that is better protected by itself, rather than simply dependent on the United States."
The French leader became the main initiator to push the project into the establishment of the nine European countries, which can quickly set up a joint military operation, evacuation from the war zone, or aid in the event of natural disasters.
The defence ministers of these nine states will meet in Paris for the first time on Wednesday to discuss details of how this force will act.
The European Union has also decided to increase its defence budget significantly since 2021 and for research and development of new technology by around EUR 13 billion over seven years.
The current EU defence budget does not amount to EUR 600 million.
However, the French military school preparing high-ranking soldiers, Professor Bruno Alomaras, said that the vision of E. Macrono on the closely united European defence is a difficult implementation.
"The idea of creating a common strategy culture is not bad, - he told the news agency AFP.
- There is, however, a great gap between the European defence, which Emmanuel Macrono, and the facts are very serious disagreements between the European partners."
Lukashenko NATO's bombed by rockets: we're not idiots
On Tuesday, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, stated that his country would need a new weapon if NATO continued to join forces at the western border of Belarus.
"If NATO continues to be alarmed by the deployment of bases in Poland or by any other means, Belarus will need more effective weapons, in particular rockets," states the State News Agency BelTA, meeting with a group of American analysts in Minsk.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already has its missile production industry.
"In recent years - you have noticed, and we are not hiding - we have created our missile industry and produced our very precise (approved) missile weapons," said the President.
Last week, Mr Lukaschenka said that Minsk and Moscow were looking for an adequate and inexpensive response to plans to build a base in Poland and to name it the U.S. President Donald Trump (Donaldo Trampo) for the "Trumpo Fort" (Fort Trump).
"Of course, we are concerned about this.
If, let us say, in Poland, they will say that they are willing to spend millions of dollars in order to displace (...) some small fortress there, of course, we are not idiots and of course we are reacting to it," said Mr Lukashenko, participating in the discussions of the Munich Conference on Security in the main group in Minsk.
"It is understandable that we are discussing with our main Union (Russia) how to respond to all of this and how to find an appropriate response at minimum costs," he added.
Western relations with Moscow have been a major cause of the Crimean annexation carried out by Russia in 2014.
Their relations also play a role in the Syrian conflict in Moscow and this year's battle in Great Britain, as it is believed that an attempt by the special services of Russia is being made to poison the former agent Sergei Skrypala's nerve paralysing substance.
The tension between Moscow and Washington further exacerbated the fall after Mr Trump announced that he plans to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on the regulation of nuclear weapons.
Russia warned that this step could undermine the global security system.
The man who executed the hunt revealed how his wife was killed by a footballer who was forced to kill his wife
Brazil committed a bloody crime in which Daniel Correa Freitas, the footballer of this country, was executed severely.
The athlete was killed at the 18th-year-old girl's birthday party.
A 24-year-old footballer found himself dead in Paranos, south of Brazil.
It is reported that it has been executed: cut-off genitalia, severe neck injuries are reported.
After killing a footballer in 38 years Edison Brittes Junior admitted his guilt and claimed that he did so because D.C.Freitas had abused his wife, Christian Brittes.
After the massacre, the Brazilians later told us in detail what happened on a crucial night.
"The evening had already arrived, when I realized that for a long time I had never seen my wife's Christian.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
I broke out the door, and I saw Daniel and my wife, who were crying for help, lying in bed.
I've been killed.
Together with my former friends in the evening, we threw him into the field and drove him into the car.
This is where I had a knife, with which I killed a man who had forced my wife to die.
I was very angry, I couldn't do anything about it," the killer said.
Along with his friends, he threw the dead footballer's body at the river, where police officers were looking for a major crime weapon.
The Brazilian Civil Police arrested E.B.Junior, as well as his wife and the holiday daughter.
It is said that police officers investigating the incident are still hard to prove that the woman was abused during the evening.
It is true that the latest news from the footballer and the photos in the WahtsApp feature can help you run the investigation.
The footballer sent two pictures of one of his friends through "WhatsApp" in which he stuck himself in a bed next to a sleeping woman who, as it turned out, was a murderer's wife Cristian.
"I can sleep here.
There are many women sleeping in different rooms of the house.
I'm going to eat the mother of the barber, although her father is somewhere nearby," the footballer wrote to his friend.
Daniel Correa Freitas, a member of the São Paulo Club, was awarded a second prize in the Brazilian league of São Bento.

Can not get folder: %s: %s
Ablama reserve winner Jalen Hurts will no longer be suspended for this season after this Saturday.
Hurts is included in the highest ranking of Crimson Tide on Saturday against the weaker Louisian team and this is the fifth player's match this season.
NCAA has applied the new rule this year – it is possible to suspend the player participating in the four matches.
This month, Athletic reported that Hurts was planning to do this because of conflicting evaluations and the team's training staff's response to them.
Then Tagovailoa changed Hurts at the beginning of the season, but Coach "Crimson Tide" Nick Sabana said he was still planning to use Hurts' skills.
Last season Hurts helped Alabama get to the matches for the national championship title against the Georgian team, but the second half replaced Tagovalioa, which contributed to the Crimson Tide victory at 26:23.
The former winner of the South East Conference, Hurts, started the last 28 Alabama cats and entered the season with a record result – 26:2.
In Saturday's contests, Hurts ended 22 of 31 "Crimson Tide" episodes, escaped 276 yards, earned four points and took over the ball once.
He also ran with the ball 15 times and ran 54 yards.
Owens: Dezas has to sign the contract immediately
The former commander of Dallas Cowboys, Dezas Bryantas, said shortly after returning to NFL.
A member of the Museum of Glory Terrell Owens said I was worthy of the Bryant immediately.
In response to the question posed on Twitter when it is intended to sign a contract with the team, Bryant announced on Friday a single word "Twitter" message: "In a short time."
Three times he was elected to Pro Bowl's match, Bryantas does not belong to any team since, in mid-April, Dallas Cowboys refused to issue a remuneration dispute.
Bryanta, who may have given up the contract with Baltimore Ravens and is constantly linked to Kliveland Browns, just before the season, said that he wanted to improve before signing the contract with the team.
In August, as Owens, still talking about the return to NFL, told the TMZ site that Bryanta should try to get back to sport as soon as possible.
"He must join the team and prove to everyone what he can," Owens told the website.
“All the surveyors believe that he is no longer successful and that he is no longer as good as he thinks he is.
Now he has to go to the team for any remuneration, accept a one or two-year contract – it is absolutely irrelevant – and show everyone what he is capable of."
In 2017, in the Dalas team, Bryanta won the ball 69 times, escaped 838 yards and earned six points.
In 29 years, the player won the longest race – 23 races – did not win 100 yards.
After signing a $70 million value contract for five years in 2015, Bryanta has not won 1,000 yards in one season and has not received more than eight points of winning balls.
"If the Director-General or the owner thinks that your skills are getting worse, you will not be able to secure or collect the desired amounts," Owens advised.
He also warned that Bryanta had to get to the team as soon as possible because it could not be achieved at all and said that it would be possible to return to the heavy-duty Cowboys.
"Of course, I don't know if their relationship isn't damaged," said Owens, who won the three seasons in the Dalas team 38 times.
"I think that in the case of Dezo, if Cowboys will take it back and have the opportunity, it will be useful for Dezu and Francis."
Planning for the establishment of CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania
In Kaunas last week, representatives of the European Nuclear Research Organisation (CERN), European Organization for Nuclear Research, are assessing the possibilities of establishing a CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten business incubators in Europe in which companies receive aid in commercialising CERN technologies, creating innovative products and adapting them to the needs of the public.
Although Lithuania only became a member of CERN last year, the establishment of a business incubator in the country was already under way.
CERN representatives visited Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) and the University of Kaunas Technology (KTU) Institutes of Material Science and Biomedical Engineering in Santakos.
At the National Innovation and Business Centre (NIVC), guests together with KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Grand University, Lithuanian Institute of Energy, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Agriculture and Business discussed the eco-system of Kaunas innovations and opportunities for young, innovative businesses.
The CERN delegation's visit is very important, because if the CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a major impact on the region's science and business innovators.
"This incubator would encourage the adaptation of CERN's knowledge and technology to key issues, such as new technology and artificial intelligence, to diagnosis and treatment of diseases, to large data processing," says Dr. Leon Balaševicius, the promoter of KTU Science and Innovation.
CERN incubators, as well as other new business development centres, provide support for business development - provide information and expert advice on how to adapt technology to product development and assist in the search for funding sources.
The difference is that the CERN incubator is more scientific.
This centre includes experts from various fields in Lithuania: information technology, materials engineering, as well as medical specialists.
The CERN is best known for the largest hadron anti-circumvention speeder in Switzerland (LHC, The Large Hadron Collider), the world's largest and most powerful particle speeder.
However, CERN studies are conducted not only in quantitative mechanics but also in other areas, ranging from cryogenicity (very cold temperature effects) to partial monitoring and radiation studies.
The work of these technologies and scientists has an impact on many areas of public importance: medicine, security and industrial development.
"Vilniaus burntė" has a new guide
The new Director General of AB "Vilniaus burntė" appointed Roka Mituza, who will replace Raymond Pilčka in these positions.
Since last summer, Pilka has been running the office of Director of the Vilnius Fuel Finance Company, as stated in the report published by the Vilnius Exchange.
Mr. Mituza is a co-founder of the manufacturing company Buga LT, listed in his LinkedIn account.
In 2012-2017, Mituzas served as the director of the region's group "SPI Group", previously worked in the "Reckitt Benckiser" and "Unilever" groups.
"Vilniaus burntė" ended the first quarter of this year with a loss of 315,500 euros.
Last year, the company earned 392,300 Euros during the relevant period.
The company’s sales income without excise amounted to EUR 4,956 million and decreased by 13,16% compared to the first quarter of last year.
More than 100 people are working in the "Vilniaus firehouse".
STT detained R. Ač - Business knowledge
The former MP and the former director of the administration of the district of Raseių district, Remigius Aza, are suspected of perversion.
He's in custody.
The Special Investigation Service (STT) shall report that the officers of the Šiaulių Board shall conduct a pre-trial investigation into possible corruption in the municipality of Raseių district.
"The former director of the administration of the district of Raseių district of R. A. (Remigius Acas - rep.) is suspected of being intoxicating.
The circumstances of the procurement of a non-transparent public, R. A. in the course of the duties of the director of the municipality, are examined - the possibility of an exclusive advantage for a private company to conclude a procurement contract with a company managed by the municipality of the Raseis district.
R.A. is suspected to have accepted a high-value (more than 250 MGL) basket for this," says the STT press release.
BNS adds that the company is the "Rasian Bus Park".
On Monday, officials also arrested the alleged head of the company "Rasian Bus Park" of the municipality of Raseis Šimait.
This BNS confirmed the STT representative for the press Renata Enskotytė.
The STT report states that the suspicions are also expressed by two representatives of companies who directly bribed Mr. Ach or participated in the masking of various financial transactions.
All suspects are detainees, their jobs and the creams carried out at home.
LSDD suspended
He was a director of the administration of the district of the Rasei district for a time after Remigius Age, but he lost these duties in April, with no support for his report to the Council.
He was also the mayor of this region in 2011-2012, Mr. Ajas - a long-term member of the Seimas, he has been elected to parliament since 2004 as the candidate for the "Twark and Justice" party.
However, in 2013 he and these parties were separated, and in 2016 the Seimas elections did not have an independent mandate to defend him.
Now, Mr. Ages depends on the separate social democrats and the newly created Lithuanian Social Democrats' Labour Party (LSDD).
Shortly after this disclosure, the president of the LSDD, Kirkilas, announced in a press release that he temporarily suspended membership in the party until the investigation was under way.
"The actions of the Special Investigation Service and the suspicions expressed to Remigius Achu, we have an unfortunate surprise, but in all cases, the law enforcement must take all the necessary steps to clarify the truth.
R. Time has temporarily suspended membership in the party until a pre-trial investigation is under way," says LSDD leader Kirkils.
In 2003, Ajad was the leader of the group of advisers, then President Roland Pakso, who was later removed from office, the advisor on matters of national security.
Meras A. Gricius: I did not directly control the work of R. Acho
Neither the mayor of Raseių district Algirdas Gricius nor the current head of the municipal administration, Liudas Kavaliauskas BNS, said on Monday that there was no information on the specific purchase of the law enforcement investigation.
Meras Gricius said about Mr. Accha's detention after having heard from the media.
"I really can't tell you that we've been very excited about the functions, I've been working as a mayor, he (R. Ajaz - BNS) is an administration, and I couldn't tell you for any reason, or for any public procurement, this was done," BNS said on Monday.
He also argued for the same reasons that he would not want to assess the administration of the former administration of the municipality of Acho.
I was afraid to say something that I could evaluate his activities, because I did not directly control his administrative work, as I was presented to me about public procurement, about tenders, said that such and such public procurements, such tenders, after which everyone in the public space was seen, were concluded contracts, which I had already seen as a mercenary.
I cannot therefore state how he led the administration at the time as its director," said Mr Gricius.
He said himself without public procurement and without affecting them.

S. Gentvilas: 90 million Euro fines for the non-implemented GPAIS business
The vice-president of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, Simon Gentvils, said that, due to the poor performance of products, packaging and waste accounting systems (GPAIS) for Lithuanian producers and importers at the end of the year, almost 90 million euros may be fined.
"As the end of the year is nearing and the GPAIS system has not started to function normally, the systemic crisis in the packaging sector is becoming increasingly real.
Unofficially, it is stated that certificates approving the handling of packaging waste have been issued as much as 1% of the planned processing tasks", says Mr Gentvils in the press report.
On 7 November, the Seimun launches an extraordinary meeting of the Environment Protection Committee to discuss the situation, to find out why the functions of this programme do not affect the reasons why the module is not actually implemented and how the Ministry of the Environment intends to address the problem.
"Without the necessary legislative or legislative initiatives, producers and importers are at risk and are again receiving huge environmental pollution taxes at the end of this year," says Gentvilas.
In his view, the deficiencies and inefficiency of the GPAIS accounting system signal a serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared to the Metrail crisis.
Concerns about tasks
Some experts warn that part of the companies may not be affected by the waste recycling tasks identified by the State in 2018.
In the light of the findings of the first half-year recycling indicators published by the organisations, the experts state the reason for concern that part of the organisations may fail to manage the required quantity of packaging in 2018.
As a result, some companies may no longer be able to benefit from the reduction in the pollution tax and would be able to pay the pollution tax for certain quantities of packages released on the market over the year.
The GOC noted that two out of three producers’ organisations currently operating are rejected and one does not comment.
Kėstutis Pocius, the Director-General of the General Green Point, said that, at least formally, whether it will be able to meet the tasks depends on whether the problems of the product, packaging and waste information accounting system (GPAIS) will be solved.
"Green Point" is planning to be able to handle all kinds of packaging tasks this year, except for glass.
Although the Green Point's task of glass will not succeed in this year, the organisation promises to compensate members for the losses resulting from this.
Experts doubt the benefits of food coupons
In planning for the government to share food coupons for the less-frequent people and thus encourage the business of family or farm trade, experts doubt the benefits of such innovation.
They agree that a new system would create an additional bureaucratic burden.
The head of the Lithuanian Business Confederation Tax Commission, Marius Dubnikov, says that the coupons have survived and the problem has not been solved, and the Government should focus on increasing human income.
"The system seems quite strange and as if taken from the old leaders.
If we want to help society acquire something or have more purchasing power, we have to focus all our capacities on how to increase people's income, and people themselves have to decide whether to buy in one store or another," said Mr Dubnik.
According to him, the government would benefit from lower incomes when offering food coupons.
"It is obvious that it applies to the less-income people, as if they were on the backseat with a voucher on which to write, well, we, this Government, have given you a voucher, and be favourable to us.
It sounds like some kind of anti-choice promises, where you want to write your signature very clearly," said the analyst.
He said that the food voucher system would need additional investments, and it would increase the administrative burden, as it would need to monitor who and how they are protected from counterfeiting.
The Bank's chief economist, Nerijus Mačiulis, says that with one instrument to achieve both objectives - to support low-income residents and small entrepreneurs - would not succeed.
"If this is the support for small businessmen, the wage aid compensates price differences and the population can buy more expensive goods in smaller shops, it compensates the price difference from the budget.
Then this is support for business, but not support for the population," BNS said Mr. Mačiulis.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macroeconomic impact and would not have substantially changed the competitive situation of small shops, rather than creating additional bureaucratic burden and could make it difficult for new market participants to arrive.
"It seems that this would be a rather bureaucratic instrument with high administrative costs, and that the people would also be quite uncomfortable, they should buy not in any larger store with a higher range of houses, but search for several specialised stores with a lower range," said the economist.
According to him, coupons are used in other countries where the volume of goods or services is limited and should be given to all equally, or to some social group.
At that time, the people receive coupons for free and can be delivered for food.
According to Mr Mačiuli, they are also used in the labour market by granting temporary tax benefits to businesses in the employment of long-term unemployed or, for example, former prisoners.
This practice, in the words of Mr Mačiuli, was also successfully applied in Lithuania.
On Monday, Prime Minister Saulis Skvernelis said that a new system of food coupons was being considered by the Government to help the poorest people, to increase competition, to encourage small traders or farmers' business.
Prime Minister Advisor Skirmantas Malinauskas BNS said on Monday that the idea is most focused on farmers and family businesses, and buyers with coupons could receive a 20%-30% discount.
According to him, the amount of coupons would be limited so that farmers would not be able to misuse.
According to him, 3-5 coupons would allow a person to benefit from 10-15 euros a month.
Although the state budget does not yet provide for the programme, it could be financed from this source, perhaps also from the European Union funds.
"Not everything currently planned or planned in the budget will be final, yet it will change in the Seimas, so it happens, the funds from one line can be transferred to another, and from ministries, the exchange of funding can be done.
It is always a matter of priority as to whether or not to refuse to find another additional source of income and similar," BNS said on Tuesday, Mr Malinauskas.
To what extent and from when will innovation be applied?
