Members of the Wells Assembly do not want to “come to the maps”
Some members of the National Assembly are reluctant to accept the proposal for their abbreviation MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of Parliament, Wells).
The problematic solution is to change the name of the Assembly to the Wells Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about the possible jokes of this abbreviation.
One of the Laborists, expressing the opinion of his party, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “refuses Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers, it's not from Wales: in the Wally Twp, it means "twice", and pwp is "cake."
According to a member of the Assembly of the Wells Party, his organization had generally “remained inadequate” and proposed other options.
The conservatives “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close to the Muppet text.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is spoken approximately as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently developing a draft law on the replacement of names, made the following statement: “The final decision on what will be called Members of the Assembly will of course remain.”
The Wells National Assembly of 2017 has been authorized to change its name.
In June, the Committee published results of a public opinion survey on the proposed options that the Parliament of Wales option instead of the Assembly found broad support among the local population.
With regard to the appointment of members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the option “Members of Parliament of Wales” (Welsh Parliament Members, or WMP), while MWP was given the highest public support.
As a matter of fact, the members of the Assembly are proposing other options, but the Chairman, Elina Jones, will find it difficult to find a solid solution to all decisions.
Reform laws will also include other modifications to the working process of the Assembly, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the system of the Committee.
Members of the Assembly voted in favour of their final appointment during the legislative debate.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, the citizens of Macedonia voted to rename the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The national vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek Government has long insisted that the name of the Republic of Macedonia implies territorial claims to the Greek province, and has repeatedly opposed the entry of its northern neighbour into the Euro Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, the opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that he was not going to recognize its results.
However, the proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the name of the country is the total price of entry into the EU and NATO.
Crisis in Garlem's revenue: Always silenced St. Martin's circle
“The elderly people in the area I was talking to said that before each corner there was a bar and a church,” says Adams.
“And now there is nothing else.”
The disappearance of bars can still be understood as:
“The communication format has changed.”
“Bar stopped being a kind of guest of the whole area where they came regularly.”
But with regard to the churches, concern is that the funds received from the sale of the assets will be enough for as long as their leaders do, sooner or later, they will be left with nothing.
At the place of the church, he added that a multi-quartered house would appear whose residents would hardly support the incomes of the area.
“Most buyers of these apartments will be white,” says Adams. “And this will be the day when such churches will be finally closed, because new neighbors will never become their neighbors.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Garlem became a black territory: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin’s church ten years later.
The first arrival of the Methodist Church left the income in the 30th century.
Their building was redeemed by the black income of their neighbors.
When St. Martin's church went into the hands of a black community, she was led by John Howard Johnson, who organized a shop boy on 125th Street, the chief trade artery of Harlem, where they refused to work or to be promoted in the service of the blacks.
In 1939, as a result of the fire, the building suffered considerable damage, and during the restoration work, Johnson’s father’s arrival was ordered to install a carilon.
The late David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father, who changed him into the head of St. Martin’s church, proudly referred to him as a “colon for the poor. ”
But the expert who tried the carilon in July called it “cultural heritage” and “unique historical instrument”.
An expert at the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that it was St. Martin's church that was the first in the world to be the instrument of his kind, played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago he was invited to play the largest Carion in the Riverside Church.
According to Merriotzer, the church of St. Martin had not yet replaced him.
In the last few months around St. Martin’s Church, there has been a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by secular church leaders, and others by the Episcopal Church.
The meeting was held in July, and the governing body of the income of the world leaders expressed concern that the parish “is attempting to transfer the value of work” to the meeting was held, although the latter were not involved in the selection of architects and contractors directed by the parish.
Some arrivals expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of Eparchy.
In California, the shark was injured by a 13-year-old lumberjack
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster hunting season, a 13-year-old shark was attacked and injured in California.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near the Bikon Beach beach in Ensinitas.
As Chad Hammel reported in an interview with the KSWB-TV (San Diego) station, on Saturday morning, he was dancing with his friends, and he heard about the boy’s cry for help about half an hour later.
According to Hammela, he first decided that the boy was very happy with the Lobster’s play, but quickly “he realized that he was shouting, “I was bitten!
They have tempted me!"
After swimming in the nest, Hammel noticed that “he had completely destroyed the skin around the key”.
“I called out to get everyone out of the water, “Here is the shark,” says Hammel.
The boy was delivered by helicopter to the Radi Children ' s Hospital (San Diego); his condition was considered critical.
The species of shark that's been attacked by a teenager is unknown.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, during the press briefing, reported that a few weeks ago, a shark was observed in this place, but it was not considered dangerous.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack had been injured in the upper abdomen.
Representatives crossed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ensinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles noted that there were 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them were not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury plans to subjugate the British perfume and cosmetic market
Seinsbury is planning to establish cosmetics and perfume divisions in shops of Buts, Superdrag and Debenhams with cosmetic consultants, in models of luxury universities.
The UK's market for perfume and cosmetics is estimated to be 2.8 billion pounds of sterling and continues to expand, as fashion and household goods fall, and a large proportion of this desired market as an experiment in 11 stores across the country will be presented to space offices for cosmetics and perfumery, and should be expected to be in many other shops in the coming year.
Supermarket owners are looking for more than filling up the former TV bands, microwave ovens, household goods, and investment in the perfume-cosmetic market is a good solution.
According to the Seinsbury representatives, it is planned to increase the dual range of cosmetic products to 3,000 names, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will be presented to a larger extent, in special locations, of the kind of organization of goods in Buts shops.
In addition, the company line of the Butique-Cosmetics products will be reorganized with the transition to the vegane products in order to meet the demands of young buyers.
The two Seinsbury shops will be presented by the perfumery producer Fragrance Shop: the first one has already been opened in Croidone in southern London last week, and the second one is expected to be opened in Sellie Oak, Birmingham this year.
Internet commerce and the trend to buy a small amount of products every day in small dolls not far from home have forced supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Cooper, President Seinsbury, says that the tickets are gradually turned into a university, and the network of its supermarkets is fighting for buyers in a competitive fight against cheap stores, such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food.
Hundreds of Seinsbury supermarkets are located in Argos, and some of them can now be found at the Habitats store since the network acquired the two brands two years ago, and this has led to the increase in sales of food and supplies from these acquisitions.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to give a new life to their cosmetics and optics have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Seinsbury and Buts was organized, but there were still differences between the participants in the income section of the sales of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
A new strategy was developed after the sale of the pharmaceutical business of Seinsbury (a total of 281 shops) by Selesio, the owner of the Lloyds Farmasi network, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years ago.
Lloyds is expected to be supporting the plan by adding a broad-based luxury care lens to La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director of Seinsbury, says: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more favourable environment for our buyers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants, who will always be prepared to assist the Council.
Our brand range for any taste, pleasant design and comfortable location of the shops will attract many visitors in the search for cosmetics and perfumery. This will be a completely new concept of shopping."
Peter Jones responded to Holly Willowby's 11 million pounds off the deal.
The star of the Lovo Dragon show, Peter Jones, was distraught by Holly Willowby from the 11 million-pound deal she was planning to conclude with Peter's lifestyle brand, but instead she preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willowby has no time for their joint brand of home clothes and True accessories.
This couple's business was compared to the Goop actress's Guinette Peltrow.
The 37-year-old Etim morning programme announced its decision in Instagram.
Holly Willowby's decision to leave them on their winning lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV, led to Peter Jones' anger, the star of the Dragon League.
According to our sources, Jones was “distorted” when the fan of the TVs at a tense meeting held on Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Bakingemshire, admitted that after the conclusion of new contracts it would not have had enough time for their common brand of household clothing and accessories True.
Their brand was compared to that of the actress Guinette Peltrow by Goop, and it was expected that her sales would double the Willowby status, estimated at 11 million pounds.
The 37-year-old leader announced his departure from Instagram, and Jones himself left Britain on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “Truly’s brand was a top priority for Holly.
This was a long-term investment that would provide her with a jobless existence for the next few decades.
Its decision has led to the conclusion of all parties to the transaction.
They were all shocked by what happened on Tuesday, as the week before the start of the brand was considered.
The headquarters in Marlowa remained a warehouse filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the care of the leading Etim morning, one of Britain's most popular stars, can go to the firm in millions of pounds of sterling because of significant investments in goods: from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as the potential delay in starting the line.
It is also about breaking up old friendships.
The three children who were raised by Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for 10 years.
Willowby created a True brand together with Taroy Kapp in 2016, and Tari's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company in March.
Both couples are often on vacation together, and Jones also has 40% of the shares of Dan Baldwin's television company.
Willowby will become an M&S Ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as the leading ITV broadcast “I’m Famous”.
A source from the nearby Johns district said yesterday evening: "We cannot comment on his business."
Complex negotiations, "and then we loved each other."
He joked about the criticism of the media because of the “invalid president” comment and positive assessment of North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
Tramp said, reflecting the voice of the leading news.
"No, I didn't give up."
He noted that Kim Chen Ein was interested in the meeting again, after Trump called them the first summit held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards reducing nuclear weapons stocks in North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have come to a standstill.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, a high-ranking North Korean diplomat Li Jon Ho made a statement to the world leaders at a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is still awaiting “responsible” from the United States after the original disarmament measures of the DPRK.
Instead, the diplomat noted, continued to use sanctions as a pressure stream.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
He said, "The North Korean case is a remarkable one."
“We were on the brink of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
And now we have a good relationship."
According to Trampa, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Chen Yin bore fruit: missile tests were terminated, hostages were released, and the remaining U.S. soldiers also returned to their homeland.
Speaking of his relationship with Kim Chen Yin, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not unusual.
“To be a nice president is so simple, but instead of 10,000 people on the street who are falling into this fully killed hall, there would be only 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered before him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: catastrophic destructions recorded, hundreds of victims accounted for
On the first day of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs said that they did not need assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population in Lomboka had lost their heads, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare the national natural disaster, which was a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that there was no need for international support, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
Saving children prepares a mission to the mission to Pala, but we do not yet know if the foreign group will be able to work on the spot.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Disaster Reduction Management, Indonesia's leadership is assessing the situation in Pala to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
In view of the continuing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country continues to be horrificly poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Acheha, they can rarely be found on other coastlines.
Despite warning of the threat of tsunamis, there was no siren in Palao to warn the population, which probably led to so many victims.
Transport between many Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Achieving disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The previous Lombok hospital to assist victims of earthquakes is sent to Pala, but the road to a new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joco Vidodo has strengthened Indonesia's oil infrastructure as the main point of his pre-election campaign and has spent countless resources to improve roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joco, a new-term candidate for the following year, has been involved in financing problems.
The President also criticised the growing interfaith enmity between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands were killed as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed swords, bows with arrows and other suicides.

The memory of Cromwell before Parliament's building sparked a heated debate on “historic rewriting”
“Exemption” Plus would be a reward for the barbaric destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts of England by its followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Creek a “summary” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “As part of the ongoing debate on the recollection of historical monuments, the issue of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace is inevitable.
In addition, it has nothing to do with the economic movement during the English civil wars.
It's possible that Oliver Cromwell is suffering for the sins of his ancestors, Thomas, who lived centuries ago.
The magnificent statue The authorship of Sir William Hamo Tornikroft reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of men, whom many still consider to be worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph John Goldsmith, he said: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered the Parliament's defence against external pressure, in his case the monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of expert debates.
But we can be sure that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century affected our country ' s subsequent development, and Cromwell was a significant historical person representing one side of this section.
Its achievements as a Lord Protector are also worthy of high esteem and respect.”
China Farmer Kills the Killer Pig
In one of South-West China's markets, the farmer became a victim of pigs, local media reported.
The body of the victim (only his name is mentioned in the media, Juan) with a decomposed artery, was found near the market floor in the province of Lupanšu province of Guijou, south of China, and reported this on Sunday.
The pork industry is preparing to introduce pigs into the pig farm, 30 May 2005, in China's Chinese province of Zinhai.
Yuan and his twin brother arrived from the neighboring province of Junan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, the twin brother discovered the lifeless body of Joanna, and the door was opened in the neighboring pighouse.
There was a huge drop of blood in the piglet.
During the trial, it was established that the pig weighed 250 kilograms of the farmer's bite to death.
“My brother’s feet were torn and crushed,” said the newspaper Guiyang Evening News Wu, a family member of the murdered.
The video from the surveillance camera showed that John came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The pig killer didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate run at the time of the investigation in order to avoid repeated attacks.
The Yuan family is reported to be negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the death of the farmer.
There are rare cases of swine attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., and seriously injured a man.
Ten years ago, a 300 - pound [300 kg] animal was lured into the tractor by a Valiant Christian and let go, just in fear of a successful woman.
In 2012, a case was registered when a farmer in Oregon, U.S.A., was eaten by his own pigs. According to the CBC News channel, a Canadian farmer, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a “down mechanism”.
“Pigs of toys,
They're biting and very curious, but they don't want to hurt you.
You should simply convey your animal's feelings of measure and respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa brings rivers to a large part of the South-West United States
It is estimated that Hurricane Rosa is losing its power by moving through a cooler water zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring floods and floods to the territory of North Mexico and South-West United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. tomorrow in New York, the cyclone reached 1st category with winds up to 135 km/h, 360 km south-west of Punta-Euhenia (Mexico).
Hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is being formed above the Pacific, which will move east to the western coast of the United States. As the country nears the coast of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical humidity to the north of Mexico, to the South-West U.S. territory.
More than 25 cm of precipitation is expected in Mexico on Monday.
In the coming days in the South-West, strong currents are expected under the influence of tropical humidity in the low-pressure zone.
The sediments from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous floodwaters, polluted streams and possible use in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, because of high tropical humidity, the drop rate may reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In certain areas of the South-West United States, mainly in most of Arizona territory, up to 5-10 cm of precipitation is expected.
The risk of sudden fast-growing floods is not excluded due to the uneven distribution of tropical rains.
At the current risk of the tropical river, walking in the desert has been seriously affected.
The lions can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and the thunder can cause the winds to collapse and raise the clouds of dust.
The low - pressure zone on the coast of southern California will collapse.
It is possible to drop up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which can cause small effluent streams and create rolling surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall in the region since the beginning of the rainy season.
There will be tropical rains in Arizona on Sunday evenings and mornings in other territories until Monday evening and Tuesday mornings.
On Tuesday, the river will be in the area of Four Angles and will be extended until the dinner of the Wednesday.
In October all over the United States, there will be a sharp drop in temperature due to low air temperature in the Arctic at sufficiently high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes such a combination leads to severe fluctuations in the small territory.
Such severe temperatures will be observed in particular in the central United States on Sunday.
Between the temperature in Kansas City (Missuri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and between St. Louis and De-Moonz (Ayova) there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, summer heat will accumulate and spread in other territories.
Most U.S. central and eastern territories are expected to have a warm weather in early October, and the temperature will reach 27 degrees in the area from the South to the North-East.
In New York on Tuesday, the air temperature may rise to 27 degrees, 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises an unusually high temperature on the eastern coast of the United States by mid-October.
Senate hearings on the case of Judge Brett Kawano have seen more than 20 million spectators
The testimony of Bretta Cavano and Cristina Blazi Ford, who accused Cavano of attempted rape in the 1980s, attracted more than 20 million viewers of six television channels on Thursday.
The political opposition to the candidacy of Kawano had received an unexpected continuation. On Friday, the media had an urgent communication: Republican Jeff Flake issued a condition that the prosecutions against the lawyer were investigated by the FBI within a week.
As Ford stated in the hearings before the Senate Legal Committee, she was convinced that Kawano had attacked her in a state of shock and tried to leave her at a school party.
Kawano gave emotional testimony, stating that 100 per cent was convinced that it was not.
According to the Nielsen Research Agency, the Friday debate saw more than 20.4 million spectators.
The Agency took into account average statistics from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not available.
Moreover, Nielsen’s rating does not always take into account viewers watching television at work.
For comparison: this is the middle audience following the American football match in the playoff or Oscar ceremony.
The largest audience was in Fox News Channel, whose leaders were in a hot position to support the appointment of Kawano: Senate hearings, all day long, saw an average of 5.69 million spectators, reported by Nielsen.
Second, ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC looked at 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million reviews, Nielsen reported.
After hearing the matter, you don't have to be weak.
On Friday, the present drama was played with Jeff Flake.
After the senator of Arizona, who was considered a moderate Republican, reported his intention to support the candidacy of Kawano, CNN and CBS, he was able to seal the camera on Friday morning on the way to the Legal Committee meeting, Flek met in the elevator with a group of activists who criticized the senator.
The whole world has seen, as he has lost his sight, getting a shout from angry women in the direct air at CNN.
"I stand in front of you," said one of them.
"Do you think he is telling the truth?"
"The strength behind you, while so many women are powerless," tried to explain their position.
Fleck replied to the activists that his office had already made a statement and would comment on the subject at the Committee meeting.
When a few hours later, the Legal Committee was prepared to approve the candidacy of Kawano as a judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all channels broadcasted a meeting in direct air.
However, Flake made one condition — to investigate the FBI's allegations against the candidate the following week, as the democratic minority had done.
Flek claims that he has changed his mind through the intervention of another senator of the democracies of Chris Kuns.
He made a final decision, speaking to Kunsa and several other senators.
Fleka's decision had had an effect, as it was clear that the Republics did not have enough votes to approve the Cavano without an investigation.
The order of President Trampa F.B.R. opened an investigation into the charges against Kawano.
British Prime Minister Teresa May blames her critics for the "political games" situation with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticised her plan to leave the Euro Union, that they put extra party interests above the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain attends a conservative party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published in one field with May, the former head of MIDI Boris Johnson criticised her so-called Shaški Plan in Brexit, stating that the introduction of customs duties between the UK and the EU is “absolutely impenetrable”.
Death of Wade Sims in the shooting: Police arrested Daiteon Simpson for suspected murder of Forvard University Louisiana
The police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
As Baton-Ruzh police reported, 20-year-old Daiton Simpson was arrested and detained for murder.
The police published a video of the drama involving Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his eyes.
According to WAFB, the CBS regional channel, the police found Simpson's DNA at the scene of the crime.
During the investigation, Simpson admitted that Wade was fatally injured.
According to the Lawyer, a deposit of $350 thousand was set for Simpson.
The coroner of the eastern district of Baton-Russia published a preliminary conclusion on Friday: death was caused by a cross-complicated gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division commends the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Division, the State Police Criminalist Laboratory, the South University Police and local residents for assisting in the operational and risk activities that have led to detention.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement forces for their “good work as a criminal”.
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-foot foreward was the native of Baton-Russia, and his father Wayne was also playing in Louisiana State University.
In the last season, Sims picked 5.6 points and made 2.6 choices on average for the match.
Will Wade's team coach made a statement Friday morning, saying that Wade Sims' tragic death caused shock and "present woe" to all players.
"That's what I've always been afraid of," said the coach.
The volcano covered the ashes of Mexico City
Volcano Popokatepetl has fallen asleep in the southern circumference of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the Mexico National Centre for Disaster Prevention recommended that the population not be approached by the volcano: it had registered activity and 183 passenger emissions per day.
The Centre’s observations show that the volcano was often torn apart and that there was friction.
In some areas of Mexico, such as Sochimilko, social media users have published photographs of lobbying glass cars covered with thin layers of ashes.
After the earthquake of 7.1 MW, which struck the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysics recorded the volcanic activity of 72 km south-east of the capital.
Volcano Popokatepetl (or, for its part, Don Goyo) has been a active volcano since 1994.
Meetings of the Catalan separatist police prior to the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday in Barcelona, a multi-thousands meeting was held on the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which broke the country into two camps; there were no clashes between supporters of independence of autonomy and police; six participants were detained.
Police officers pushed out protestors of independence, while the latter, dressed in black masks, were out of order with eggs and dusty cows, raising the cloud of dark dust in the centre of Barcelona itself.
After the police launched a deep hold on the crowd, the riots resumed with a new force.
For a number of hours, the leaders of independence said, “Let us not forget, nor forgive.” And their opponents answered them by saying, “Peace be upon Spain.”
According to local press reports, fourteen participants in the shares went to the hospital with minor injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which was recognized by the illegal Spanish Government, but was an important milestone for separatists.
Catalonia with a huge surplus voted for an exit from Spain, but the phenomenon was low because the opponents of the exit were predominantly boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, last year, almost 1,000 people were injured when the police tried to block the referendum at the polling stations.
On Friday, separatists were on the way to monitor the demonstration in support of the Spanish police in order to prevent it from being conducted.
The demonstration was the same, but it went the other way.
A 68-year-old electrician named Narsis Termes, who visited a separatist meeting in his wife's company, said that the hope of gaining the sovereignty of Catalonia was becoming increasingly elusive.
“Last year, one of the most important events in our lives happened.
My parents cried happily, having been given the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a state of humiliation," he said.
In the recent December elections in the local authorities, the Catalan parties serving as the office of Spain have won an important victory, even with a small break, but this year their movement is losing its supporters, as many of the well-known movement leaders are either on the run or in custody, awaiting a court for their role in organizing a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old telephone recorder in support of the police, said that the conflict was being heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“The tension is growing,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junkeras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists, announced his intention to join the European Parliament next year.
“Participating in ordinary elections in the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government,” he said.

"Livingstone" victory over "Randers" thanks to the Mengy target
First goal Dolly Mengi won a guaranteed victory by the Livingstone team
Thanks to the shot by Livingstone, he won an unexpected victory over Rangers. For the main coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerard, this is only a second defeat for 18 games.
The Dolly Mengy hit leveled Gary Holt's team with the Hibernian club in the starting table, where they share second place.
The Gerard Club was unbeatable in the Premier League season. On Sunday, they will meet with the leaders of the Harts group, from which Rangers will stand at eight points.
On Thursday, Rangers will take place on their field of battle of the League of Europe with the Austrian Rapid Club (Vienna).
The Livingstone Club continues its playless series in the division, has already won six matches and has not received any injury since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the lead coach of the team.
Lost moments for Livingstone in the grip of intense guests
Holt's top coaches had to account from the very beginning — the Rangers obviously did not have to deal with their efforts.
Scott Robinson was able to break through the line of protection, but the naked one of his weak attempts failed, and then the defender of Alan Litgou, turning too wide, was unable to prevent the sword of Kay Halkett to become a net.
The receiving party allowed Rangers to play in front of their line of protection, counting on dangerous moments when the game is resumed.
That is how they missed this important goal.
Rangers gave up a free strike, and Livingstone took advantage of the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a transfer to Menge, who killed him from the center.
By then, Rangers had been superior to the ball, but the protection of the host team was unprovoked, so Liam Kelly's doorkeeper was not concerned.
The second time continued under the same scheme, although Kelly had to take a hit from Alfredo Morelos.
The Rangers returnman, Alan McGregor, turned down the sword from Scott Pittman, and Litgou made a large delivery from the standard.
The ballers have been constantly hit by the Livingstone penalty, but all the attacks have been reflected, and two penalty demands — one for causing the Glenn Midlton Halkett and the other for the game — have not been met.
“Penomenal” game “Livingston” — analysis
By BBC Scotland — Alaster Lamont, Report by Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and excellent result for the Livingstone team.
Absolutely all the players were great and often exceeded all expectations, continuing their return to the football Olympics.
Their style of games and composition has hardly changed since they were brought back to top ratings, and the great merit of Coach Holt was that he had mobilized this team from the beginning.
His team had a lot of real heroes.
Captain Halkett led a wonderfully organized defense, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Uralla relax.
But Rangers couldn't get in the beat.
Although they had good playtimes with Coach Gerard, this time they didn't justify our expectations.
In the last few minutes, they did not take possession of the ball, and they only managed to protect the host team one day. Rangers, who have fallen into the middle of the table, have something to think about.
Cold reception of Erdogan during a visit to Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in the morning, there was a great weather, and both of them were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Ergogan's visit to Germany to establish a relationship between the two NATO parties, a visit, and without any conflict.
The heads of countries were unable to understand issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
After Erdogan was sent to Cologne to participate in the ceremony of opening a huge new mosque.
In Kelna, the largest Turkish diaspora is located outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a 25-year-old crowd to enter the mosque, but many of Erdogogan's supporters were nearby to see their president.
At the same place, opponents of the Erdogogan regime, including the Kurds, gathered to give a full vote to condemn both the policy of Erdogogan and the decision of the German Government to invite him with a visit to Germany.
The presence of radically conflicting views at the meeting reflects the uncertain nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots carry Erdogogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Road accident Deptford: Car collision led to the death of a biker
In London, the car was hit by a bicycle driver who ended up at the scene.
Avariya happened near Besyod Street and Evelyn Street, a revitalized crossroads in the south-east part of the city of Depfort, about 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver and the men who came to the scene tried to help the bicycle driver, but the man ended up unconscious.
This is not the only accident with a fatal outcome in the area: only half a mile from the scene, on the street of Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver was hiding.
The London police report that work is currently being done to identify the deceased and inform his closest relatives.
As long as the road is blocked and the bus route is changed, drivers are asked not to go to the area.
Long-Lartin prison unrest: six policemen injured
According to the Long-Lartin Administration, six police officers were injured during the riots in the men ' s prison.
The men's prison of Long-Lartin (Wustershir) has continued to be indiscriminate since Sunday, about 09:30 a.m. local time.
The Tornado team was called upon to suppress the disturbances involving eight prisoners from one wing.
Police received minor damage to soft tissues of the face; medical assistance was provided on the ground.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specially trained staff were recruited to permit the incident in the Long-Lartin Correctional System.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically deny the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their degree of repression can be changed for a longer time.”
There are now more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had fallen into a hospital under attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, the prison manager was forced to bring special-purpose units to calm the busted prisoners who had thrown billiards into the overseers.
Hurricane Rosa can drown Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit the dry territories)
Arizona rarely falls into the area of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time it was “lucky”: at the beginning of the next week, the hurricane of Rosa, making her last bite, must cross the desert part of South-West and bring the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and the southern and eastern part of Nevada, in southern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Hurricane Rosa will cross the line over Phoenix on Tuesday and flow through the river on Monday evening.
The Office of the National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported in Twitter that “all ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) walked 65 km from the Arizona border.”
According to the latest forecasts of the National Meteorological Service, there are between 5 and 10 cm of sediments reaching 15 cm in the Arizona Mogolon-Rim plato.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is possible that up to 2.5 to 5 cm of sediments can reach 10 cm of sediment sites.
For areas whose rivers flow along the side, the rain caused by Hurricane Rosa can be a blessing, for the region has long suffered from drought.
Although the floodwaters may pose a danger, heavy rains can ease the dry season that is not in the South-West of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona's territory is affected by severe drought (second category severity),” reports the weather.com website.
At first, Hurricane Rosa crashed into the Mexican state of Lower California.
As early as the day of the resurrection, the hurricane, with a maximum speed of 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Punta-Euhenia (Mexico) and is heading north at 19 km/h.
Hurricane has been found in a colder water zone on the Pacific coast and thus loses its power.
The second half of the day, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
In some areas of Mexico, abundant rivers are expected to flow under the threat of flooding.
“In the territory of the Lower California to the north-west of Sonora, up to 7-10 cm of sediments, up to 25 cm of space”, reports the weather.com website.
Also, Hurricane Rosa is heading north through the territory of Mexico, and early in the morning, on Tuesday, he will arrive at the border with Arizona in the tropical cyclone category, from Arizona to the southern part of Utah to the evening of Tuesday.
“The main potential risk of hurricane Rose and its residues is related to strong floods in Lower California, the north-west Sonora and the south-west desert areas of the United States,” the National Meteorological Service reports.
The sediments are expected to cause dangerous floodwaters, polluted desert streams, and possible mining in mountain areas.
The attack in Midsomer Norton: four suspects were detained in an attempt to kill

After hospitalization, it is considered to be “stable”.
On the same night, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstok area, reports the police of Avon and Somerset district.
The police will look for possible witnesses of a crime with any video on the mobile phone.
Donald Trump: "All hatred, all the evil" of the Democrats has broken into Kavano."
“The vote for Judge Kawano is a vote against the ruthless and annoying tactic applied by the Democrats,” Trump said at a meeting of his comrades in Willinga, West Virginia.
Trampa believes that in the process of approving the nomination of Kawano to the candidate, “all hate, all evil” of the Democratic Party has broken down.
On Thursday, Kawano gave testimony at the U.S. Congress, in his emotional treatment he categorically rejected the charge of Kristina Blja Ford that he had sexually sought it more than 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also gave evidence during the hearing on her indictment.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that that day “the American people saw the shining mind, class and courage” of Kawano.
“The vote for the approval of Judge Kawano is the vote for the approval of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an unencumbered public service list,” the president announced the crowd of his fellows in the state of West Virginia.
In his speech, the President raised the question of the nomination of Kawano, about the importance of the appearance of Republicans in the Congress and the House of Representatives.
“For the most important elections in our life, only five weeks remain.
I don't participate in them, but I participate in the race in a different way," he said.
“I’m wearing it like a tantrum and fighting for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the democracies have set themselves the goal of “by all means to resist us”.
Under the regulation, the first key vote in the Cavano nomination Senate should be held no later than Friday, the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party reported.
The earthquake in Indonesia has taken hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died, many had been swept away by giant waves that had seized the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, which had been hit by the incredible force of tsunamis and earthquakes.
The first victims were hundreds of visitors to the beach festival in Palo. On Friday, the coast reached an altitude of almost six meters, which had dared all on their way and led to the instant death of many of the present.
Cunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 on Richter's scale.
“When a storm warning was issued yesterday, people continued their beach rest rather than to escape immediately in hiding, and therefore lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Indonesian National Disaster Management at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunamis didn’t come, there were cars, dams, entire homes, nature destroyed everything on its way,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunamis crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h, and they were forced to land on the coast.
Some of those present were taken to the trees, saving their lives.
About 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Pala.
The aerospace management of natural disasters shows destroyed houses, shops, broken bridges and a heated mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still crushed by subterranean thrusts.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the territory of 2.4 million people.
The statement by the Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technologies of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicated that the land-based energy emissions caused by the explosion were approximately 200 times more than that of an atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunamis may have been stronger than expected by the city’s geographical location at the end of the long narrow Gulf.
Negroho called damage “massage”, adding that destruction was inflicted on thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels.
The bodies of the dead were found under the ruins of the broken buildings; all traumas were 540 people, and another 29 were found missing.
Nugroho added that victims and destructions could be even more significant along the coast 300 km from Pala, in the area of Dungala, which was close to the quake.
The communication with Dungal was “completely destroyed and no information was received”.
“More than 300 thousand people live in the area of Dungala,” reports the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers have already moved to the disaster zone.
“There has been a tragedy, but it is not yet a border”, the communication says.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized because it did not report the arrival of the tsunamis in Pala, but the authorities believed that the waves had reached the shore when the initial warning was still in force.
The social media featured a loving video in which a man on the top floor of the building shouted about the rising tsunamis, desperate to attract people's attention on the street.
After a few minutes on the beach, the water wall is demolished, entire homes and cars are removed.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authority of this role.
Earthquake and tsunamis have led to major electrolytes, resulting in the loss of communication in Pala, which has made rescue operations very difficult.
Military transport aircraft were sent from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuated population still lacks food and items of the first need, government sources reported.
The city airport was opened only to receive humanitarian aid; it would be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, the evacuation centres in Palu will visit President Joco Vidodo.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision charity came well from Dungala to Pala, where the staff found shelter in the courtrooms of their office building. According to Dosebai, their eyes saw a terrible picture of complete destruction.
“They saw a huge number of ruined houses, ” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Beneficiary organizations have begun implementing humanitarian aid mechanisms, but many complain that international NGOs have not been able to enter Pala.
Indonesian legislation allows funding, humanitarian assistance and foreign staff only after the announcement of a natural disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed to be a local disaster,” says Aulia Ariani, a press secretary for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government announces a national natural disaster, we will be able to receive foreign assistance, but the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Pala, friends and relatives of the people who had fallen away, they still look forward to their wonderful salvation, which will bring the people back to their faith in the best.
A little boy fell into a sewer hole was saved on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers pulled out of the building a woman who spent two days there near her mother's lifeless body.
Hendon Subandon, a coach of the National Assembly of Indonesia on Paraplaneticism, prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among other people trapped in Roa Roa's hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
"I am not the last person in this sport, and it is emotionally difficult to survive," he said.
Hendon recalls, as he learned of Roa Roa's attack by other paraplanetists, over the next few hours he desperately tried to contact whatsApp with his colleagues from Pala who were relaxing at the beach festival.
However, his messages were represented by a series of galleys, not two pigeons.
“This means that the communications were not delivered”, he believes.
Durable property $26,750 during the service of the ATM in Newport-on-Levia

Channel West: The rapper has changed its name
Rapper Kane West thought of himself as a new name: Yes.
He announced on Saturday in Twitter: “The identity, formerly known as the Canine West”.
The 41-year-old West has long carried this pseudonym and even put it in the name of his eighth album that came in June.
The news of this appeared in the introduction of Kanha to the Saturday Night Live broadcast, where he plans to present his new Yandhi album.
Kanha West will address the leader instead of the singer Ariana, who has canceled her participation due to “emotional experiences”, the author of the broadcast said.
West has previously stated that pseudonym is not only a reduced option but also a religious sense.
“Ye – the most common word in the Bible, it means “we”,” so West explained the name of his album in a recent interview with Big Boy.
"That's me, that's you, that's us.
At first it was Kanye, which means "one", and now I'm just her, that is the reflection of all the good, bad, unknown to us, right now.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are."
The dog is not the first known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Daddy, Pi Diddy or simply Diddy, asked to call himself Love (“love”) or Braza Love (“Brother Love” or “Brother Love”) this year.
The West rapper J-Zi also changed his name several times: with a definition and without, written letters or strong.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military forces against the civilian population
Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore never to resort to military force against the civilian population before the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which ended with a bloodshed.
Speaking on Saturday at Tlatelolko Square, President Lopez Obrador promised “never to resort to the help of the army to oppress the Mexican people”.
At this place on 2 October 1968, the students were first shot in a crowd during a peaceful demonstration, and a 300-year-old was shot and shot, and this took place in the background of the strengthening of the left-wing student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador also promised support to a Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and open more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of prospects of learning lead young people to criminal peace.
In addition, the United States of America, the United States, the United States, the United States and the United States have committed to double funding for the development of JI.
China should not be underestimated and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (IM) - the United States should double investment in its scientific development, Li Caiaphas, an investor and an entrepreneur in the field of II development with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
A number of US ministries have made earlier statements on II work, although the United States as a whole does not have a clear II development strategy.
At the same time, China introduced its own plan last year: its goal is to become the first in the innovations of II by 2030.
"The increase in the II research budget would be a good start twice, given that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we expect the next II breakthrough," Li says.
The increase in funding could double the chance that the next major achievement of II would be achieved in the United States, Li CNBC said in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, the Kremney Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director General of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most outstanding companies in China, Face +.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie-Melone on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest in the U.S. Otel, and then he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency Defence Advanced Research Projects, and was interested when the next competition was held to help find people with a non-traditional mindset.
According to Lee, U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“Not China swallows academic leaders, but corporations,” says Li.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring light from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
It is convinced that immigration policy changes can also help the United States to develop artificial intelligence.
“I think that Green Cards should be offered automatically to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences provides scientific funding similar to that of the National Research Fund and other government organizations providing money to American researchers, but the quality of the scientific work in China is confirmed by Lee below.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, which should involve partners from industry and scientific circles, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a programme called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in II research.
In the meantime, US legislation, which sought to establish the National Intelligence Security Commission, has not taken any action in this regard for several months.
Macedonians vote on the referendum on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in favour of a referendum on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would allow for a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, composed of the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim in its territory and has put a vow on its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments concluded a new name-based agreement, but opponents and nationalists claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote for the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the appearance of voters would correspond to the minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The question raised at the referendum was: “Do you support NATO and EU membership, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”.
The name-change partners, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for entry into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future country, for the young of Macedonia, so that she can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski, who lives in Skopje.
A sufficient number of Members of Parliament stated that they would respect the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive, although it did not have the legal force to do so.
A change in the name will require a two-thirds majority of the members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 13:00.
However, the appearance was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters were voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voters from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country, which will open the way for its entry into NATO and the European Union in Strumice, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Prior to the building of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, prepared a small stage, placing chairs in front of the chambers appointed by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are members of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a high-level head, not in violation of the thresholds of official offices," Kawadarkov says.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can contact other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would make investments in Macedonia, which was so necessary in that country where unemployment was more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be rewarded because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that the positive answer will be “the key to our good future”.
The survey, published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but this would be the required event below.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV revealed that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of these figures claim to be positive.
In order for the referendum to take place, the appearance should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious impact on the policy of the Western Government since it came to power in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguaro from Manchester City is protecting Brayton to kill the target.
Sergio Aguaro and Rahim Sterling argued with the Bryton defense, bringing Manchester City to victory at 2:0 a.m. on Saturday at the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero shot the target at 65 minutes, it seemed that it was no work for him.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a passport at the center of the field.
He missed out between three Bryton defenders before going out into open space.
Aguaro was surrounded by four rivals in green football.
He went to one of the defendants and stabbed several more at the edge of the Briton Criminal Zone.
He also handed over Sterling's sword to the left.
An English attacker, located in a fine zone, returned to Aguero's sword, which had knocked the Bryton door to the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero is experiencing some leg problems,” told reporters of Manchester City, Pep Gardiola.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he killed a naked man at that moment."
But it was Sterling that gave the Blue Sky an initial advantage in the struggle against the Premier League.
That target was killed in 29 minutes.
In this game, Aguero won the ball, being deep in the territory of Brayton
He gave a great cut on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sonne did a few things before giving Sterling a transfer to a remote barn.
The attacker, the Blue Sky, struck the ball in the door just before it ran out of fields.
Manchester City was defeated by Hoffenheim in a team of champions Leagues on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rein-Nekkar-Arene in Zinshheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to select the eyes at Colorado Rockiz.
After Washington Nashionals got out of the playoff battle, there was no special reason to force events.
But the insatiable Sherzer hopes to take up the fight against Colorado Rocky on Sunday, but only if Roxie, who runs into one Los Angeles Dodgers game in the Western Division, will have problems in playoffs.
By winning 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday evening, Rokyz has already won at least 7 or 8 seats, but they are still hoping to secure a title in the first division.
“Even though we play just that, but at least we can hold positions, knowing the enormous importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of viewers and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the petitioner on Sunday, but, according to the latest data, they are willing to expose Sherzer to this role.
Sherzer, going out on the 34th game, threw a ball on Thursday for the drinkers, and on Sunday, in his exit, he will be a drinker.
The statistics of the D-Pitcher “Washington” are 18-7 with an ERA rating of 2.53 and 300 cars in 220 2/3 innings in the current season.
Trump is running a pre-election race in West Virginia
Referring to the importance of the presence of Republicans in the interim elections, the President specifically referred to the situation around Brett Kawano, a candidacy issued by the President to the Supreme Court.
“All we did was put on the map in November.
Five weeks left before one of the most important elections in our life.
It's very, very important, I'm not running, although I'm really running, fighting for good candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to restore power, using whatever means are necessary, and we observe dishonesty and wickedness.
They are no matter who they try, who they must cross, to gain power and control, and that is what they want — power and control, but we are not going to give it to them. ”
The Democrats, he said, had set the goal of “resisting and hindering”.
“And you will see it in the last four days,” he said, calling the democracies “evil, false, false and false.”
He referred to the Legal Committee of the Senate, referring to Senator Diane Finnstein, which triggered a loud voice from the hall.

The Labour Party is no longer an organization with different views.
It does not show tolerance to those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party offered a vote of disbelief to me, it was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last in a number of Members of Parliament from the Laborist Party who have not yet said that we are not welcomed for what we are saying.
A similar attitude to my colleague in the Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for my lack of confidence with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, in the irony of fate, is the issue that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Laborist Assembly was informed on Friday that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of my eight-year stay in the position of a local member of Parliament from the Laborist Party, the evening Friday meetings of the GC were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today's tone does not correspond to those many meetings, but the promise of a “more human and soft” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been.
The fact that there are no differences in views in the Laborist party is becoming increasingly evident, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable for the party to guide the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues, whose political perspective I had previously considered to be similar to my own, had come to expect that I would radically change my views and take the position that I would never agree with — whether national security or the single EU market.
Every time I give a public speech, it is not important that I speak, social networks should be targeted by insults that call for the abolition of the elections condemning the policy of the centre or claiming that I should not be a member of the Laborist Party.
And that's not the only thing that happens to me.
Indeed, I know that I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments in my address still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face each day the flow of sexual or racist attacks, but never retreat.
It is most disappointing in this policy that such a number of insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Laborist party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a “wide church”, and with every vote of mistrust or change of party rules, we are already becoming a “wide church”.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations calling for me to sit quietly and to speak, and then everything will be all right with me.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined the Laboristas 32 years ago, as a student of the school, who was upset by the neglect of the Tatcher Government, because my school class had literally collapsed, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who needed it most, whether it was the work of a local deputy or a government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, I have not done so in previous elections.
No one in Notting East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say that our country is moving to Brexit, which is guaranteed to cause economic, industrial and public damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to spend their time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to appeal to is not Nottingham Momentum, but my electors, it doesn't matter whether they're a teammate or not: I'm proud of what I'm doing to you, and I promise that there's no danger that the results of the elections will be lifted or that political opportunity will not prevent me from acting as I think is necessary in your interests.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament from Nottingham East
Er 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible “Er” comes first
Two late attempts may have resulted in a number of failures, but “Er” certainly deserved a triumph in this amazingly interesting tenent prime minister.
Now they're headed a table, the only unbeatable team of tens.
Finally, all thanks to their superior protection, as well as the ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merchi the full right to be satisfied.
"All this time we have been checked for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to grieve," said Peter Mercie.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "It's worth honoring "Er," they've done their best for us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fraser Klimo brought "Er" ahead, but a yellow card issued for the game "Voriors" by the Scottish player Rory Husse allowed "Melrose" to proceed, and Jason Baggot caught up with an unrealized attempt.
Klimo increased Er's fraction from the penalty before, directly in the middle of the game, earned a score, and then, in the break, he made a lonely attempt, making an account of 17-5 in favour of Er.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's experiment with Baggot reduced the poison to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, and after his return, “Er” moved further, thanks to the attempts made by Stafford McDawel by Climo.
The current Captain, Er, Blair McFerson, then received a yellow card, and again Melrose, forced the rivals to pay a regular game for the unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
However, the landlord returned, and when Stroan Hatchinson received a yellow card for the arrest of Klimo without a sword with a penalty line, Makferson made a tacdown behind the coming "Er".
Klimo realized the advantage without stopping almost from getting out again, after Kyle Row got hit by David Armstrong and sent the final attacker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the field owners.
The Still Game star is going to start a new career in a restaurant business
The Still Game Ford Kiran star is about to start working in the hospitality industry: it was known that he was appointed director of the licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, a script he writes about, and is filmed with a former comedy partner, Greg Hemfil.
Duet announced that the upcoming Ninth Series would be the last show, and it seems that Kirnan is planning his life after Creegang.
According to official information, he is Director Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the Scottish Sun has suggested that Kirnan is planning to participate in the "excellent restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"Our sea," the uninhabited exit to Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the military headquarters in La Pase.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
The marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are described by the slogan: "Our sea is right.
It is our duty to bring it back."
Throughout Bolivia, with no access to the sea, there is still a vivid memory of the shoreline lost to Chile as a result of the 19th century's bloody conflict because of resources; and the desire to sail back to the Pacific.
These hopes may have become the most bold in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting decisions by the International Court of Justice, which will take place on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, the spirit of unity and mental balance and, of course, there is a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kaldzilla.
Many Bolivians will observe the decision-making process at the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate for Bolivia ' s sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of the Bolivian indigenous peoples, who has an unforgivable fight for re-election next year, is also looking forward to the decision that will be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court would hardly take a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if so, that would change little.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to control the territory of Chile and has already stated that there will be no impact on the outcome of the negotiations.
The decision of the International Court of Justice only six months after the last arguments were heard said that the case was “not difficult”, says Pas Zarat, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, Bolivia has not been moving forward, and it has always been delayed.
“The current administration of Bolivia has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate said.
According to her, the military rhetoric of Morales destroyed Chile’s last goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but then it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
These two countries have no diplomatic relationship since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Wellce, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees that the court ' s decision was made too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139 years of differences with mutual benefit”, he states.
Kaldilla also disagrees with the fact that Morales, still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, uses the military-sea problem as a political facilitator.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he says.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to confirm once again that we have to move beyond our past.”
North Korea declares that nuclear disarmament will not be possible until it can trust the United States
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yoon Ho states that his country will never be able to destroy its nuclear weapons unless it is able to trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri took part in a meeting of the UN Geneva Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the commitments made at the Singapore summit among the leaders of its countries.
His comments are made as the US Secretary of State Mike Pompey gradually returned to the path of resumption of the impasse nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Chen Jin.
Ri argues: the dream that long-term sanctions and US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever put North on its knees is a utopia.
Washington is afraid to adopt this declaration if the Pyrenees do not take significant disarmament steps in advance.
And Kim, and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, want to hold the second summit.
But skepticism about the serious rejection of the arsenal, which the country is likely to consider as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompey plans to visit the Pyrenees next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows demonstrate the latest line of mass-maintenance clothes that promise to appear in the media, and they will be brought directly to you.
If you want to add the trap to your collection or protect yourself completely from sunscreens, there is no need to look for anything else.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented the mass of unusual main clothes, which are part of their SS19 collection and the blind visitors of the Fashion Week in Paris.
This summer, extremely practical traps won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their snowflakes to the podium.
The outstanding specimen of Valentino: the main escape dress decorated with wide, periphery-like, beautified patterns on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included decorated with precious stones of arbusia, a wizard's hat and even pineapple, but all these main clothes were not intended to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also appeared in the world a collection of amazing masks, which had to become very early in Halloween.
On many of these stone masks, the mouth was covered, and they remembered the portrait of Gannibal the reader more than the creation of the corner.
One of the specimens recalled the equipment for underwater swimming with a tube and protective eyes, and the other was frozen.
If you're a high-modecrat, you're lucky.
Modern critics predict that these huge traps have every chance of getting used to mass sales — directly to you.
The large-scale traps follow the five La Bomba, a two-foot loose trap that has already been put on, from Rianna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult label that released this extremely impractical trap that won so much popularity in social networks gave birth and sent another huge accessory to the floor — a broken beach bag, almost as large as the same model in the bathroom wearing that bag.
The orange bag of a popular rafia with a white leather handle and a rafia scarf became a bright copy of the collection Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 on the Fashion Week in Paris.
The Selibrite-Stylist Luke Armitaz tells F: “I think that large strips and beach bags will appear in the media next summer, and since the designer has produced such a furor with his productions, it would be very difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to peace citizens
Scotland's independent schools continue to be a shining education tradition, which has been confirmed in 2018: the outstanding results of the examinations have demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other public-significance disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are taught throughout Scotland, and there are efforts to provide a higher level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers and the status of the citizens of the world.
As part of the educational sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school programme, we see that modern languages remain a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak with a man who has understanding, you will understand.
If you speak to him in his native tongue, you will speak to his heart'
This is a convincing evidence that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build and trust relations with citizens of other countries.
As a result of this year's recent exams, we see that the language is the leading position in the league tables and has the highest score of the exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher assessment of “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received “A” in Mandarin (Chinese language), while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received “A”.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are undoubtedly of vital importance to children and young people in the future.
Language materials are now being used in the same way as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in education programmes of independent schools and other educational institutions.
The survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the problems faced by employers in filling vacancies were language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming a key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of what profession a student will choose, if he learns a second language, he will gain a real benefit in the future by adopting another additional skill that will suit him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives competitive advantages to a person who knows several foreign languages.
According to a survey of YouTube, involving more than 4,000 adult British in 2013, 75 per cent failed to speak well in a foreign language to support the conversation, while French was the only language with a double percentage, 15 per cent of respondents said.
That's why investing in language education is so relevant now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially languages in developing economies, will give children more opportunities to find a good job.
In schools in Scotland, there is a wide range of languages that are taught — each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for Britain in the light of future development of the country by 2020 — such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, independent schools will always choose from a number of teaching languages whose members are experts in these languages.
Scotland ' s independent schools seek to create an environment of education that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, no matter what future awaits them.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital in the global business environment for the future development of the country, so this should be adequately reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be viewed as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, which provides diversity and benefits for young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done well.
John Edwards, Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland
Lebron debutes in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The ambitious expectations of fans to see Lebron James speaking for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers almost ended.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton announced that James was playing in a pre-season resurrection match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But he still has to figure out how much time he has to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eight,” Walton replied on the Lakers official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James was probably playing a limited time.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games in the Lakers schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” says the game.
Tromp race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting to wave election meetings tonight in Willinga, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings of Trump next week, including a friendly visit to Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the candidature proposed by the Supreme Judge was postponed, Trump sought support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republics risk losing control of the Congress if the vote took place in November.
How many evenings will the Trump meeting be held in West Virginia, and how can we view it online?
A meeting with Trump in Willinga, West Virginia, will be held at 19:00 a.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trump meeting with West Virginia voters online on direct broadcast on YouTube.
The Trump will probably take place at the hearings held this week on the subject of the nomination of his candidate Brett Cavano to the Supreme Judge. The proposal by Trump of that candidate has caused a lot of negative reactions, as Kawano has been accused of sexual harassment, and the vote to be held in the Senate will be postponed for a week until the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main objective of this action is to help the Republicans in the November elections to increase their pre-election rate.
Thus, President Trump's campaign is aimed at helping these five meetings, which should be held next week, to “activize the activities of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters writes.
“Congress control is so important for its agenda that the President must visit as many states as possible, because we enter the tense pre-election season,” says the press secretary of the Trump pre-election campaign, who refused to be called Reuters.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Willinge can attract supporters from "Ogayo and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
The trip to the West Virginia Trump this Saturday is the second visit of the state in the last month, since it has benefited from more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate in the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisi, who is lagging behind as a result of the interrogations.
“The fact that Morrisi has begun to force the contestants to come to the president is a bad sign for Morris,” says Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia (Quoted from Reuters).
Ryder 2018: United States Assembly demonstrates readiness to fight and hopes by sending Sunday to couples meetings
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday game two by two, perhaps, was exactly what Kubok Ryder needed.
The transitional initiative is an extremely clever sport concept, but it is believed to be a game, and in such competitions it is particularly expressive.
So who's got the initiative?
“They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I think this is a small initiative for us,” Jordan Spit said.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and another twelve on the horse.
The Americans, in the view of Spit, feel “wind in the parouses”, and they have reason to hold a spirit of height, not least because of the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can praise three of the four.
The bed was untwisted from you to the branch, as was the personal example.
The bells became louder as his round went on, the decisive ball was thrown into the hole, closing the match when they and Thomas were two by two.
His hit that won him in the 15th hole was met with a similar blow, one of the things about his belief in a chance for the American team.
“We need to get together with all the forces and focus only on our game,” said Spit.
That's all that's left of the game.
Go through 18 moons and become the winners.
The only games that have earned more than Spy and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who have undoubtedly entered the history of Kubka Ryder.
A strange but charming couple from Europe killed four of them, and they don't seem to know the mistake.
Molywood was the only couple who did not worship the gods on Saturday, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday mornings, on Fridays and again on Friday mornings.
Such a series and how their energy seems to circulate between them and non-existent patients strengthens the faith that they will not win, and when the sun is hidden behind the Le Golf National field, there will be no more famous game that holds Europe's potential victory than Flitwood or Molinari.
It would be nice if they were both in different holes at the same time.
However, it is about the glory of Europe so early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly argued with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the game in four matches when he was paired with Alex Norren.
The gods and the two double gods on the first nine holes took out the Spanish and the Swedes, from which they could not get out.
So no one will help you out of your pit on Sunday.
It is so interesting to watch the games in four balls and four players because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they exchange and the intention to reduce, and how the strategy can change into a single moment.
So far, Europe has played better as a team, and it has gone a long way in the last day, but this Thursday session has also shown that the United States has all the efforts to combat, in which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day, Cuba Ryder Europe leads with account 10-6
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of Cuba Ryder after the end of the Saturday match in four swords and Thursdays with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duate Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods to bring the Le Golf National account to four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to return to Hazeltina two years ago, dominated the alleged mistake of the American team in the morning in four matches, winning with account 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in Thursdays, won two matches, but they could not reduce the gap in the account.
Team Jim Ferrick needs eight points from the 12-resurrection match to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European novelty to win four points in the row, while he and Molinari, who have received the Molinwood call after the sensational outputs, have become only a second pair to win four points in the first four matches in the history of Kubka Raider.
With Woods and Patrick Reed in four matches, they were then beautifully united to win over the fallen spirit of Woods and American novelist Bryson Decebmo with even more determined 5/4.
Woods, who played two Saturdays, showed periodic problems, but now he lost 19 of his 29 at four, and four at seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who took a break before the morning game in four matches, returned to rival Henrik Stanson on Thursday, winning Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepku with a 2/1 account of the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, the game has not become an easy and enjoyable walk to the south-west of Paris.
The three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas worked on Saturday became the focus of two eyes for Americans.
They won a decisive victory with 2/1 on Spanish John Ram and Ayan Polter in the game in four balls and returned later to win Polter and Rory Macylroy with 4/3 on Thursdays, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Kubka Ryder team was driven out of four points, leaving alone, given that the team of Ferika, as I own, had to play the destruction to hold the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, the contract on Sunday looks as if it were beyond their capabilities.
North Korea said that “categorically” would not be disarmed unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were increasing mistrust towards the United States, and that his country would not, under any circumstances, give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yoon Ho stated to the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “essential measures of goodwill” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear site and the obligation not to increase nuclear weapons and the development of nuclear technologies.
“We don’t see a symmetrical reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we cannot unilaterally take the first steps towards disarmament.”
While Rei reiterated the already-sounding North Korean complaints against Washington ' s “step-by” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement was important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Phanyan did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Chen Iin and Donald Trump at the first in history at the summit between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to start moving towards the “declaration of the Korean peninsula”, and Trump promised North Korea security assurance.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States states that the Pyrenees must first abandon their nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to the call to weaken the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that “denuclearization should first be done”, and increase the level of pressure through sanctions to enforce their goal and even object to “an announcement of the end of the war”, says Rí.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the current problem is that the continued sanctions are increasing our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, mentioned by the United Nations leader at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Zhee In, which took place in the last five months, and added: “If the issue of denuclearization was South Korea, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be such a dump”.
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed sharply from last year when he told the United Nations Assembly that the goal of North Korea's missile to the U.S. mother was inevitable after “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim “a suicide missile”.
This year, in the UN Trump, which threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, Kim praised him for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that much remains to be done, and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for the process: “Will it take two years, three years, or five months? ”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Phanyan to take the steps that have been taken.
However, US Secretary-General Mike Pompey said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The introduction of sanctions by the Security Council should continue actively and compulsorily until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unilaterally increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with a view to overcoming the financing of the Phanyan nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN Geneva Summit and announced after that meeting that he would visit Pyrenees again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July he left Phanyan, he said that progress had been made, but for a few hours after that visit, North Korea condemned him for “bandish demands”.
North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures” at the meeting with Moon this month.
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he spoke about were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are learning to rest at special courses
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, helped all students to learn to sleep more and to fight the chauvinist culture of the continuous consumption of caffeine with a view to stabbing “nights in the air”.
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often had no idea how to care for themselves.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first in the United States.
After it was opened, he had a burning idea to introduce such a course, with a report on the impact of the lack of sleep on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, the girl came to me and said, ‘I’m sorry that I knew about this only now that I’m almost out of my training.’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — that I was surprised," he told The Telegraph.
The course, for the first time proposed to students this year, describes how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sports success and how it improves the overall human self-esteem.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry of Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Service, said that the university decided to introduce this course after it was found that students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the week of school.
The job is one hour long, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
A section of the exercise offers a picture of a room in a community where students who are circling coffee cups, dishes, trainers and books receive information about how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, which are causing a lack of sleep — affect sports outcomes and how important it is to get sufficient sleep daily.
In the second section, participants will learn how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
An interactive map of the campus encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these exercises will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, as any other person has the right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health," added Professor Chesler.
According to him, the false feeling of pride that a person can sleep all night is still widespread, and modern technologies, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
According to him, sufficient sleep of good quality is the “secret weapon” of the student to combat stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to combat excessive weight, as the lack of sleep translates the brain into a state of hunger, making him feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old californician studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to develop a course, visiting one of the courses last year during his first year of training in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to disseminate this information throughout the camp.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all graduates to have a similar training program before entering a competitive training institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students establish a shelter warning that they should lie down and sleep, and that they remember the harmful effects of the blue light, which is released by electronic screens and LED lamps, which violates human bioarthritis and leads to sleep problems.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Randers": Gol Menga wins the Gerard team
Rangers survived the regular sad trip, as the Dolly Menga goal led the unassembled team of Stephen Gerard to the loss of a 1:0 account in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team was hoping to win its first victory after a 4-1 win in St. Johnston in February, but the Gary Holt team only defeated Gerard as a manager, leaving his team behind eight points, giving the Harts team an easy victory to the Scottish Prime Minister.
Manga was killed in seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lost the spirit, apparently, were not going to balance the account.
While Rangers now dropped to 6th place, Livingstone rose to 3rd place, and only Hibernian joined in relation to the head killed.
And Rangers may have additional problems after a line judge, Kalum Spence, had to treat the head injury after an object was dropped from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements in the team that passed through Er in the semifinal for the Scottish League.
In turn, Holt went along with the same Libya 11 strategy, which led to an increase in the Harts gap last week, and he would be pleased to see his well-manufactured composition squeezed the opponents at each step.
Rangers may have been leading the sword, but Livingstone was more successful when a ball hit them.
They had to be shot naked in two minutes when the first Meng Scott Pittman transmission stopped Alan McGregor, but the defendant took advantage of the chance.
Kigan Jakobs had a criminal attack on Captain Craig Halket, but his defence partner, Alan Litgou, was only able to send a sword to the side of the bar.
Rangers took control, but in the last third, it seems there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he had to be beaten for forty-five minutes when he and Steven Loules met, but Judge Steven Thompson disagreed with the Colombian statement.
Rangers had only two hits in the first time, but the former doorman Ibronx, Liam Kelly, was only concerned about the hit by Lassan Kulibali's head, and the weak hit of Ovi Edjaria.
Although the first goal of Libya, which was killed at the 34th minute, may not match the game, no one can deny that they deserved it solely by their own work.
But again, Rangers couldn't cope with Jacobs' game with the standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave up Scott Robinson's sword, who was trying to hand over the sword to Meng for completion.
Gerard began acting at the break when he replaced Kulibali on Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately resulted when the ultimate defender gave Morelos his passport, but the impressive Kelly slipped from his line to capture.
But Livingstone continued to attract visitors into their imaginary game with Litgou and Calcutta, constantly making long transfers.
The Holta team tried to increase the break-in at the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgou gave up the field.
Rangers, Glenn Midleton, repeatedly demanded a fine after he met Jacobs, but Thompson refused again.
Almanac: Geiger's Designer
And now the page of our almanac "Houring Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany this day.
Gaiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Gaiger accountant.
As one of the foundations of science, the Geiger account also became one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s Colocola Kornodo, with the cowboy-like Roma Rogers and Dale Evans, which seemed to be unlike scientists, in the main roles:
Man: "What's the matter with this thing?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earpieces on, you can really hear the effects of the atoms generated by the radioactive activity in the minerals.”
Evans said, "That's right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, not only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see anonymous cells
A new anticortical vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the anomaly growing cells and kill them
Part of the treatment of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to identify anomalous cells
The method is to remove immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions.
As a result of this change, cells are able to “see” the type of protein that is characteristic of many types of cancer, and cells must then be again 0.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one patient who has received this vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize anomalous cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and change them into laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can “see” HER2 proteins, which are characteristic of many cancers, then the modified cells are reintroduced to the patient.
Professor J. Berzoofski, U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research, Vifez, Maryland states: “The results we have received indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzoofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancers”, including breast cancer, ovaries, light and colorectal cancer.
A similar method has been successfully used in the treatment of leukemia. It has been used to reduce the immune cells in patients and their “training” how cancer cells should be affected.
Kanha West has been defending Trump in the MAGA trap after his appearance in SNL.
It's all bad.
Kanha West was promoted in a study during the Saturday concert, which he spoke to the US President Donald Trump, claiming that he would re-enter the post in 2020.
After performing his third song, entitled “The Sparrow of God”, which he carried out, with the title of “Do America a Great Again”, the performer spoke against the Democrats and supported Trump.
"I often talk to white people, and they ask me, "How can you support the Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," the executive said.
The SNL channel made a parade with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kawano's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on Ms. Blaise Ford's statements on sexual harassment.
On TV, they did not show how the crowd was upset with West, but this video was uploaded to social networks by Chris Rock.
Now it's unclear if Rock tried to make this move out of West.
Also, West complained to the public that he was being ridiculed after the scenes.
"They've come to me behind the stage.
They're saying don't get in that trap.
They were really yelling at me!
Washington Examiner quotes him as saying, “And they said that my position is not cool.”
The West continues, "Do you want to know what's not cool, put on the superman's pay so that no one can tell you what to do?
Then you will need love."
His comments, at least twice, attracted the attention of the audience, and the SNL actors seemed to be disillusioned, and one person said to the publication: “All the studios were loaded in silence”.
Westa was recently invited to replace Ariane Grande's singer, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before that.
Many have succeeded in playing Westom’s song “I Love It” in the Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA Candis Terner group, who wrote in Twitter: “One of the bravest people: SPASIBO FOR the support of many.”
The director of Karen Hunter's show wrote on Twitter that West was just "who he is, and it's absolutely remarkable".
“At the same time, I don’t want to support anyone (buying his music, clothing or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my opinion, divides and distributes an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
"So do we," she said.
Prior to the start of the show, the rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “formally known as the Canyon West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and walk on the feet of Didi, also known as Paff Dadi, Paffi and Pi Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snup Dog originally had the name Snup Lion, and as another example, it is possible to bring an executive who has recently become a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then the name of the artist, formerly known as Prince.
Trying to charge the murder because of the legit in Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife wounds at a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Balihakamora as reported in the police.
The respondent is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
Kit Harrington's Games Star Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harrington is known as John Snow's fanning sword in the violent medieval fantasy HBO "Game of thrones".
However, a recent 31-year-old actor who has been criticizing a hero-cat stereotype said that such characters often make young people think that in order to respect you, they must be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said he believed that something had gone wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently got married to her colleague on the movie "Game of thrones", Rose Leslie, her rival, admitted that he was “very uneven” to this problem.
“I personally take this question seriously: where have we made a mistake with the perception of courage?” asks the actor.
"Why do we teach adults that we have such a problem today?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for this outbreak of toxic courage because of too much muscle.
The actor continues: “What is born, and what is acquired?
Why do they teach on television and on the streets, which makes young men feel that they should show only one particular side of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems in our time, and the question is, how can we change it?
Because today, with young people, there's really something wrong.
In an interview, he also acknowledged that he would not participate in any of the games of the thrones after the series ended next summer, stating that he had “ended with battles and horses”.
Since November, Kit has played a major role in the re-re-re-sponsible “True West” Sam Shepard, a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently announced that he believes that a meeting with Rose's wife is the best final of the thrones for him.
“I met my wife on the show, so he gave me my family and my next life,” says the actor.
Rose played the gamer — the passion for the character of Kita John Snow in a fantasy series entitled Amy’s Honorable Award.
Para noted the wedding in June 2018 in the home of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people in the country suffer from these diseases.
Only around 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018.
The overwhelming majority of new cases of the disease were sexually transmitted, as evidenced by changes in past trends.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of a blood transfusion.
However, the number of HIV infections was practically zero, Chinese health representatives said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT is still widespread.
Studies confirm that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70-90 per cent of men who have sexual relations with men are eventually married to women.
In many cases, transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Government of China has pledged universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters rejects information on the escape of information on the guilt of senators of the Republican Party, complaining of “hazardous lie” and “the theory of conspiracy”
A member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, denied the charge on Saturday that one of her staff posted personal information to three US senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat argues that claims have been made by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“The lie, the lie, and the more false lies,” says Waters in his Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes the address and number of United States senators, Lindsey Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hetch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at the Capital Hill during the hearings of the Senate commission on sexual harassment against the candidate in the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano.
The escape took place some time after three senators questioned Cavano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the communications, was linked to the Waters office and reported on the Waters staff, reported Hill.
“This unwarranted claim is absolutely false,” Waters assures.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these frauds was in no way responsible for the escape of this information.
This unwarranted claim is a complete lie.”
The Waters statement was immediately criticised on the Internet, including by the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flesher.
“This is an angry denial,” Flesher writes.
“This means that the author has a temperature not suitable for work at the Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why are you angry?
And you don't have to justify it either.
And you shouldn't dig in the prosecutor's motives either.
We need to stay calm and cool."
Flasher seemed to have compared Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavano, whose critics accused him of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republic of Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If that's true, it's very important," he writes.
In his statement, Waters wrote that her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these frauds.
“We will make sure that criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they bear the legal responsibility for all their actions that can be destructive and dangerous to all and every one of my staff.”
Johnny English is striking again — a weak parody of the spy Rowen Atkinson
Today it has become a tradition to look for Brexit's meanings in any new film in which it somehow pictures Britain; it also refers to the new Parisian espionage of Agent Johnny English, whose production began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with Agent Johnny English: Recharge.
Will the self-defense picture with the legend "evidently that we are all shit" become a new attempt on national exports?
In any case, the English-language pianist Johnny has received his right to chaos for the second time — his name clearly implies that he is a broad-screen comic book for a non-English cinematographic audience.
Hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his remarkable claims in the glamour band, received a little Clouseau, Mr. Bin's drawings and the portion of this guy, who introduced one single note to the song Chariots of Fire in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the sarcastic “International” Atkinson, once played in the oblivion of the now Barclaycard TV commercial, in which the hero left a complete chaos behind.
In this last edition, JE has one or two pleasant moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in middle age, and the shovels were lying on his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates the gift of Atkinson for the physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely excessive, especially because such “serious” cinema samples, such as “Agent 007” and “Mission incompetence”, are now definitely offering comedy as an element.
It's such a feeling that jealousy is meant for children, not adults, and for me, the amazing crimes of Johnny English are not as inventive and appropriate as those of Atkinson in the movies about Mr. Bine.
The permanent mission is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker penetrated the top secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the duty agent, Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, became an episodic role.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, an angry and hard-pressed figure already suffering from a huge political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the Quazi-Terez-May character, but in the scenario there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers told her that since each active spy was compromised, she would have to get someone out of retirement.
And here on the stage is the unencumbered Johnny English of his own person, who now works as a school teacher in some post institution, but also gives informal lessons in secret operation: there are some good jokes here, as English offers the skills of the spy academy in rock style.
English returns to Whitehall for urgent instruction and is reunited with his former unsuccessful friend Baff, who is playing Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man who is under command of the underwater boat, the role of the fun hockey clown, in which Vicki Pepperdin is a little lost.
Thus, Batman and Robin are again in the game because of the terrible mistakes they have made in the secret service of Her Majesty, and they are faced with a beautiful rock woman, Ophelia Bouletov, in the performance of Olga Kurileenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the charm of the charismatic technological billionaire, who claims that he can solve the British computer problems — the perversity of Jason Walt, who plays Jake Lacey.
The English and Buff are starting their odise of furry jokes: masked under officers, they are burning up a French restaurant; they are creating chaos, smuggling themselves on the luxury yacht of Volta; England is born with a complete anarchy, trying to use the beauty of virtual reality to get to the interior of Walt's house.
All these scenes, of course, are a kind and thoughtful idea, but there's something very childish about it.
Very moderate things.
And, as with other films, Johnny English, I couldn't think of it: can't the British cinema industry give Rowen Atkinson a role that really compares his talent?
Laborists deny that they are developing a plan to reduce the working week of British up to four days for a five-day salary.
The Laborist Party of Jeremy Corbin is planning to consider a radical plan that says that the British will work four days a week, but will be paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's managers to provide the rescue workers with an additional output resulting from the revolution in the field of artificial intelligence.
This would allow staff to enjoy three-day returns for the same salary.
The sources reported that the idea was “introduced” into the economic agenda of the party and would help the population to become a part of the workers.
The trade union Congress approved a four-day working week so that workers could benefit from the benefits of the changing economy.
The high-ranking source of the Laborist Party said The Sunday Times: Policy revision is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not happen at the same time, but the four-day working week is our goal, which is in line with the party's approach to changing the balance in the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, because the Green Party has promised a four-day working week during its 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this desire is currently not endorsed by the majority of the Laborist Party.
The representative of the Laborist Party said: “Four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered a party”.
The Black Chancellor John McDonnell used the Laborist Conference last week to specify his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to expel power from the “unable directors” and “speculators” of the municipal companies.
The plans of the tender firm also mean that the current water channel shareholders may not get their share back, as the Laborist Government may do “teach” on the basis of alleged errors.
He also confirmed plans to include company directors in the Boards and set up the Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the capital of the private sector to the workforce, which could receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak "60 minutes", whether the FBI's investigation into Cavano might change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Bretta Cavano has held a final vote on his appointment as a senior judge at least weekly and asks whether the Agency's findings can encourage any of the Republican senators to support Cavano.
In an interview shown on Sunday, a 60-minute correspondent, Scott Pelley, interviewed the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Grem, whether the FBI can find anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I went to the meeting and said I was talking to Judge Kawano.
I called him after it happened, I blew up this information, and I said, "You did it?"
His answer was firm, definite and clear."
But the opinion of Grem in the vote remained unfavourable.
“I am firmly determined about Brett Cavano, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, by action comparable to dynamite,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I do know is that Brett firmly denied all of this," added Grem, addressing Christine Blacie Ford.
“None of those whom she called as witnesses could also confirm these facts.
It's been 36 years.
I have not seen anything new in it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual musical event involving an impressive star with at least an impressive mission, the end of poverty worldwide.
For the seventh year at the Festival of Peace, tens of thousands of people have reached the Grand Duchy of the Central Park, but not only to benefit from the speeches of such performers as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but also to describe the present objective: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which was opened in 2012, is the continuation of a global poverty-reduction project by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you are not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), you had to participate in voluntary activities or send an e-mail to the world leader, make a telephone call or perform any other or other significant actions to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the 12-year-old World Citizens Festival been in achieving its goal?
Is it an idea to reward people with a free visit to the concert that they are currently convinced of calling for action, or is it just another case of so-called “cliticism” when people believe that they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen organizers claim that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been registered at the festival, carried out by its supporters, who pursue many different goals.
It is recalled that through these actions, world leaders have promised to allocate more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group sounded 390 commitments and announcements made as a result of its action, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that funds provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most significant commitments is The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementing professionals committed to “helping children fully discover their potential”, promised to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the district, after more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, such as you, we can make social injustices in terms of insufficient food for past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Panel also stated that after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to encourage the United Kingdom to improve food for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the Food Force project, which would cover 5 million women and children through activities aimed at improving food.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The organizers of the Global Citizen answer: "This will be a long and difficult path that we will have to stumble and fall from time to time.
But as in large movements of civil rights and against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Jeanelle Monae are some of the artists who will take part in this year's events in New York, and will be the leader of Deborra Lee Fernness and Hugh Jackman.
United States dollars can use the military fleet for the purposes of “blocks” to prevent Russian energy exports: Minister of Interior
U.S. Minister of Internal Affairs Ryan Zinke stated that Washington could “apply to the assistance of its naval fleet, if necessary, to prevent the impact of Russian energy on markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that the presence of Russia in Syria, particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate Government, is a pretext for the study of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he says.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to address this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, is able to ensure the openness of sea routes and, if necessary, to prevent their energy from entering the market,” the Minister said.
Zinke called on the participants to organize the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-commercial group that positions itself as a “power user” in the United States.
He further compared Washington ' s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less effective use and exchange of fuel,” says the Minister, calling Russia “a pony with one trick”, whose economy depends on fossil fuel.
Statements were made that the Trampa Administration was tasked with increasing exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials of the Trump Administration, including the President of the United States themselves, are trying to convince Germany to exit the “inappropriate” project of the North Stream-2 pipeline, which, according to the Trump, made Berlin a “guardian” of Moscow.
In Moscow, it was repeatedly stressed that the North Stream-2 project, worth $11 billion, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position called for a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industry in the face of the German Industry Federation (BDI) called for the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes with our energy supply, it creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after the recent meeting of Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will carefully explore the potential for a presidential ballot in 2020
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would carefully explore the possibility of balloting the President after the interim elections.
At a meeting of the city council in Holioque, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking of participating in the pre-election race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and “start” our broken government, and for that “top” a woman is needed,” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I will carefully consider the possibility of balloting with the President.”
Warren thus appreciated President Donald Trump's activities during the meeting: “It is in the wrong direction.”
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both the Trump itself and his candidate for the post of Judge Brett Cavano.
In his Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote: “Federally, we need to investigate the FBI before we start voting.”
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that it should be scored in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the University of Saffol/Boston Globe, 50 per cent of the “probable” voters of Massachusetts stated that the senator should not get involved.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed him.
Other well-known names of the democracies discussed in connection with the 2020 perspective include former Vice President Joe Baiden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byiden argues that he will take an official decision by January, reports Associated Press.
Sarah Paelin told about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trak Paelin at a meeting with voters of Donald Trampa
Trek Pailin, 26 years old, served in the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
“My son, who has returned home, is now living the same as other family members who have suffered the effects of PTRD and have been injured, and our soldiers are returning with the injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “a white eye” and said about his son and other veterans of war, “they are coming back to others who have been slaughtered, wondering whether their companions, soldiers, pilots, and any other war they have fought in their country have been treated with the same respect.”
Trak Pailin was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and charged with family violence against women in the situation of violence and possession of arms in the state of alcohol abuse, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 States in the region of Colombia support the challenges of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombia area support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy, which prohibits the provision of asylum to refugees or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of the 18 states and the county submitted an analytical note to Washington on Friday to the court's counsel on the support of the asylum-seeker who is a dissuasive politician.
The full name of the complainant in the application for Grace v. Sessions, submitted by the American Union for Civil Liberties in August against federal policy, is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her husband, “and his son, who is a criminal group”, had been subjected to ill-treatment, but on 20 July, US officials refused her request for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers in support of Greece said that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala had made a large number of applications for asylum in the United States, such as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new United States policy on asylum had repealed the decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed immigrants without documents to be saved from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Carl Rasin, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “neglects decades of application of State, federal and international law”.
“The federal law requires all asylum applications to be dealt with on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the request, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the judge advises.
Lawyers also claim that the immigration policy is harmful to the US economy, stressing that this is the category of citizens that is more likely to become entrepreneurs and that “provides the necessary workforce”.
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sashns, ordered immigration judges to no longer provide asylum for victims of domestic or gang violence.
“Refugees will be provided to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political convictions”, Sashns said in his statement of 11 June.
This tool has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Pala: the number of deaths doubled in search of survivors
For survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly difficult.
“Now it’s very difficult,” says 35-year-old mother, Riz Kusum, comforting her sick baby at the evacuation centre of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, emergency aid will bring the wounded.
Pure water is in the deep pit."
People return to their destroyed homes, dig in wet things, and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals affected by an earthquake of 7.5 have been overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Harris, who had a vertebral fracture and shoulder, were resting near the army hospital in Pala, where patients were treated in the open air, because they had to leave the room because of the constant strong thrusts.
He cried, recalling how a strong earthquake destroyed the hotel number on the fifth floor, which he had recorded with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
I think I was pushed into the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming, asking for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope that they are saved and are all well with them."
US Ambassador accuses China of “accused” by “advertising advertising”
A week later, after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a four-page ad in the daily American publication, describing the mutual benefit of trade in the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread the propaganda.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to a payroll supplement to Des Moines Register China Daily, Iowa's largest commercial newspaper, when he filed charges against China in an attempt to join the US Congress on 6 November.
The trumping of Beijing's attempt to join the U.S. elections is a confirmation of the fact that US officials have reported to Reuters: a new phase is taking place in the growing Washington pressure campaign on China.
While it is customary for foreign Governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalation of the trade war, which results in a balance between tariffs for imports from their countries.
China's responsible tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were intended to defeat exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republic of Trump, by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term Governor Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products in China, claims that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in a post published in the resurrection magazine Des Moines Register, “now doubles this grass by placing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Government of China takes advantage of the heart of our American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, paying and posting advertising to Des Moines Register,” says Branstad.
“Even so, in newspaper kiosks here, on the streets of Beijing, you will hardly hear different voices and not see the true diversity of views that Chinese might have learned about China’s worrying economic policy, because local media are under strict control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of the most well-known Chinese newspapers was “debt off” from the proposal to publish his article, although he did not bring the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: the Kawano population distances female voters prior to the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to remain on the side and defend the candidacy of the Supreme Judge Brett Kawano, despite several allegations of sexual violence. Analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially by women, which may affect future interim elections.
The emotions surrounding the situation have spread to an extreme, and most of the Republicans have formally stated that they want to continue to vote.
That is not the case later, says Grant Rier, professor of politics at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, in his article published on Saturday.
Rier has doubts that Senator Jeff Flek (R-Arizona)'s attempts to investigate the FBI in the last minute will be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, and they will not forget about it tomorrow or November," said Karin Jean-Pier, Senior Adviser and National Representative of the Progressive Group MoveOn Washington, D.C. on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters called for November in advance! On the contrary, the Senate, when the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee, decided to apply for Kawano, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blassy Ford, said Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the framework,” said a non-party politician Steve Rothenberg on the news site.
“People say that the situation has become quite strong, and that is true.
But everything can get worse, especially with regard to women voters in the suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate as a senior judge in charge of sexual harassment, analysts assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the move, the move could lead to a response.
“It’s already a problem for the Republican Party,” said Michael Styl, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, as NBC News reports.
“This is not only about voting in a committee or final vote or whether Kawano is on the scale of the defendants, but also about how the Republicans deal with how they relate to it,” says Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose democracies, a news channel.
Nevertheless, Americans seem to have split up a few on the question of who to trust anyway — Ford or Kawano, and to hear more on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford's statements exactly or most likely, while 35 percent said that they believe in Kawano exactly or most probably.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Kawano lied most or certainly at the time of his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
At the request of Fleek F.B.R., the prosecutors are currently investigating the charges against Ford, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore in the Senate Legal Committee that Kawano, being in a state of shock, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for a senior judge showed her her genitals at a party during her education at Yel University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Pouch plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Li, the inventor of the World Cup, launches a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and how to give people access to what information.
In an exclusive interview, Fast Company Berners-Li joked that the purpose of Inrupt was to obtain “world domination”.
“We have to do this now,” he says about his start-up.
"This is a historic moment."
The annex uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal data storage” or POD.
It may include lists of contacts, cases, calendar, music library and other personal and professional data tools.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify — everything can be used in one browser at a time.
The uniqueness of the personal data repository is that it is fully managed by a user who can obtain access to any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal development of rights and opportunities through data”.
According to the Director-General of John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company has provided resources, processes and relevant skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Li, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several staff members with whom the project is contracted, and the volunteer programmer community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Li said that he and his team did not negotiate with Facebook and Google on whether his companies needed to make radical changes, which would make all their business models completely different at the same time.
“We do not ask permission from them.”
In his post to the Media on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that “the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid network”.
In 1994, Berners-Li changed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, the vote of Berners-Li sounded quite influential in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even starting Inrupt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Fund and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” says Berners-Li.
Bernard Vann: Church servant awarded the Victorian Cross during World War I
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one military priest was awarded the cross of Victoria during World War I, and this event was observed in his home city 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellengliz and Løukur.
Regrettably, he was killed by a sniper four days later, so he never realized that he had won the highest British military award.
The memorial in honor of this event was presented Christmasly by his two grandsons on the parade in Rušden, Northgemptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "significant", that the memorial was opened 100 years after his grandfather received his prize.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann carried out his battalion through the San Canton Canton channel “in a very dense fog and under a strong fire of field weapons and ammunition”.
Later, he threw himself on the fire and led the group forward with “greater courage,” and then one hand fired the field gun, beating three troops of the unit.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, hearing more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old grandson Michael Vann said that “he could hardly do the same heroicly, but it calms down”.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a vein at the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra, Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great honour for him to participate in the parade” and added that “the maturity of the real hero is confirmed by the support that will be given to many people”.
MMA worshipers didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but instead showed them Peppo pig
Imagine that you didn't sleep all night to see the full Bellator 206, but you didn't get to see the main event.
The San Jose table contained 13 battles, including six main programme battles, which were broadcast all night in direct air on 5 British television channels.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, the British patients were shocked, seeing on the screens "Peppa Pig".
Some of the patients were not quite impressed, for they did not sleep until the morning just to see the fight.
One of the fans in Twitter called this change of the message to a child’s multifilm “some painful joke”.
“It was a public decision that this content was inappropriate for 6 hours tomorrow, so they had to switch to child programmes,” said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President Bellator on marketing and communications, when asked why it happened.
"Yes, "Swinka Peppa."
The president of Bellator Scott Kocker said that they were planning to make a schedule so that future battles could also be seen by viewers from Britain.
"As for the re-show, I think we can deal with this issue," Koker said.
"But there's a Sunday, six o'clock tomorrow, and we can't solve this until a Sunday after our time, and it's already Monday for them.
But we'll do our best.
Believe that when the message was changed, a number of text messages fell off, and all of them were far from friendly.
We were trying to solve this problem right away, and we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out that this was a matter of public importance.
I promise that this will not happen the next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we're trying to increase that number, but we're getting a shift.
Yeah, that's a bad thing."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily experienced a feeling of inadequacy because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic davier Tom Dale says he's growing up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize that “not all are like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Lavern, he said he spoke about gay rights to give another “hope”.
He also said that the victory in the Olympics had become less worrying for him after he had a child.
The permanent leader of Kirsti Yang's multi-year show was on vacation for a few months because of his illness.
Dale, who served as the main guest in Lavern's programme, said that he felt “nothing more important than any of his peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable for society, both for boys and girls.
He says, “These feelings of worthlessness and incompatibility have been quite real to this day, but they gave me strength, and I was able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something” to not disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
A double bronze Olympic medalist became a known LGBT activist and, at his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia, called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality this year.
He said he had expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he could live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others “a hope. ”
The three-time world champion said that the feelings of the man, US director Dustin Lans Black, with whom he met in 2013, “remained his job”.
Last year, Dale married Oscar, who was 20 years older than him, but claimed that the age difference was never a problem.
“If everything happens in your life at the age of such a young person,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died three years later, “it’s hard to find a peer who has the same heart - to - heart - opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Dale said that “all his worldwide commitment” had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win the gold medal," says the sportsman.
"But you know, there are things that are more important than the golden Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale told me that his father did not want to live up to what he was dying, and one of his last requests was that they were tickets to the London 2012 competition.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not around, and you can't sit there first," says Daley.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize that he was not invincible,” said the sportsman.
The following year, Daily took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — to dive in front of a crowd of fellow students at the Olympics, it wasn’t a better feeling,” he says.
It also inspired him to choose the first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small — that helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes him so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 in English summer time.
Mikelson, who's not in shape, spent this Saturday on the rock of Kubka Ryder.
American Phil Mikelson will set up a record on Sunday, played his 47th Cup Rider match, but he will have to reinstate the form to avoid an unpleasant wave.
Mikelson, who played at the biennale on record 12th time, was sent on Saturday with Captain Jim Furick for four matches and Thursdays.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as was often the case in the United States, a five-time major winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own field in the hope of correcting what worries him.
Never had the directest hit, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old sportsman was not the ideal candidate for the Le Golf National race, where the long raf usually punished for inaccurate hits.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Mikelson in the ninth match on Sunday will meet with the British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined the new Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans lose four points in the 12 single match, they're making a bitter start, Mikelson's match can be a decisive one.
Ferek expressed confidence in his partner, although he could still say so.
"He fully understood the role he is playing today, caught me in the back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Ferik.
"He's pretty confident about himself.
He's going to the Hall of Glory, and he's done so much for these teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two matches.
I was hoping for more, but that's how it was, and that's how we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone."
On Sunday, Mikelson will win a record of Nick Foldo's number of match-ups in Cuba's Ryder.
This may mark the end of a career in Kubque Rider, which has never been in line with his individual record.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 injuries and seven none, although Ferik said his presence had little benefit to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, stubborn, he likes to educate people, and he's a great guy who's interesting," he explained.
“I think that this week young games were fun with him, and that was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
Captain of the European team Thomas Björn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Björn, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that a significant single-level leadership in Cuba can easily turn into an adverse side.
The Datchanin won a five-point victory over the Americans in 1997 in Valderram, where the team headed by Northern Balesteros won the final race only to hear the least difference, with an account of 141 1⁄2 to 131 1⁄2.
“You continue to remind yourselves that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but only for a while now,” said Bjorn, who was printed in the photo, after viewing the 2018 Class, won on the Le Golf National with a 5-3 account both on Friday and yesterday, which resulted in a 10-6 account.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
You'll be all over tomorrow.
Go and do the right thing.
Until the eyes are visible on the board, nothing is finished.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I did not speak in silence, focusing on the 12 games of our team, but we know so well that what we stand against is against the greatest games of the world.”
Happy as his players made their golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have been more in this.
Another test awaits us tomorrow.
Individual statements are in progress tomorrow, and this is quite another matter.
Always nice to be with your partner when things go well, but when you stay there alone, you experience all your professional golfer's strength.
That is exactly what it takes to get the players to put themselves on the top of the game tomorrow.
Now the partner remains behind, and he should also make every effort.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferrick, believes that his games will be better than with partners, except for Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who have taken three points from four.
Ferik himself has gone through all this carousel in the last few days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finally losing when Europe held the 'Medine Miracle'.
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had split his toys before the last day.
"We have 12 important fighters tomorrow, but you would like to finish it as soon as possible in Brooklyn as in Medina.
When the initiative moves one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle of the match.
We have designed our plan for the game, and we have organized the people as we thought was right, you know? Tomorrow we will try to create a miracle.”
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the resistance by meeting with Rory Macylrow at the top of the game with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ayan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I’ve selected such a group of guys, and so on, because I think they’re going to overcome all possible shortcomings in this way,” Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
Introduction of the new German military ship to service
The new German fleet had to be operated in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the Cold War era, but this would not be less than the following year due to inadequate systems and price growth, local media reported.
The introduction of the "Rainland-Pfaltz" operation, the main ship of the entirely new Baden-Württemberg Freight, now delayed until the first half of 2019, reports the Die Zeit newspaper with reference to the military representative.
The vessel had to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery made the fate of the ambitious project difficult.
The four Baden-Württemberg ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will be replaced by the older Bremen ships.
They are known to have a powerful rifle, a number of Zenite and Anti-Crobile Missiles, as well as some of the Cells technologies, such as reduced radiolocation, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods, which should be the possibility of deploying new freight for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continued delay in the operation means that the most modern warships that are said to allow Germany to extend its power abroad will become obsolete by the time they enter arms, says Die Zeit.
The F125 crash hit news headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned to the shipyard after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and machine defects” that made the warship useless in the use of the war.
The lack of software was particularly critical, as Baden-Württemberg's ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half the working force on the old Bremen Frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its productivity and limited WFP ' s ability to introduce future updates.
It is estimated that the 7000-tonne Rainland-Pfalz twice the heavier ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the wrong equipment, the cost of the whole project, including team training, is also a problem.
It is said that it has reached EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of retaining the anchors of the new frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings of a reduction in the military-sea power of Germany.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Committee on the Defence of the German Parliament, acknowledged that military and maritime forces had actually “ended to stockpiles capable of deploying”.
The officer said that the problem in time had been aggravated because the old ships had been removed from service, but their courts had not been granted replacements.
He was visiting that none of the Baden-Wurttemberg Frigates could have been taken over by the fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flying Mouse
A new study carried out in one of Scotland's hotels has the task of showing how flying mice use the landscape in search of food.
It should be hoped that the data obtained will allow for a re-view of the behaviour of unique dairy wings and will help to further conservation activities.
The study organized by the National Fund of Scotland will examine ordinary bats, soprano bats, as well as brown long-haired bats and dobanton bats, inhabitants of Inverewe Gardens, West Ross.
Special registries will be established at some points around the site to track the flying mice throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile local surveys using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the screams, as well as the types of activities for which the various groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the environment will then be drawn up and a report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their conduct in the landscape.
Rob Duar, NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, hopes that these results will show which sites are the most important for flying mice and how they are used in each species.
This information will help to identify the main directions for the management of the habitat environment, such as the formation of meadows, as well as the ways of maintaining forest masses, optimal for flying mice and other related species.
The populations of flying mice in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are at risk of disappearance because of construction and development activities that affect their habitat and the loss of the environment.
Wind turbines and lighting systems may pose a risk, as well as an adhesive tape for flies, chemical processing of building materials and hunting of domestic insects.
In fact, flying mice are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching.
They use a complex eco-location technique to accurately identify obstacles to the flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, is very serious about the population of flying mice.
Ten trained experts are working in the organization, who regularly carry out surveys, check-outs, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has even created the first and only reservation in Scotland of the flying mice in Thrave in Damfris and Gallowee, where eight of the ten species of Scottish flying mice live.
The real estate manager David Thompson said that the property was an ideal territory for them.
“Here, in Thrave, a great place for flying mice,” he says.
“Here are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of the environment.
But many flying mice remain unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need for a good existence.”
He recalled the importance of checking the presence of flying mice prior to the provision of technical services within private authorities, as the unintentional destruction of one nest could lead to the loss of 400 males and young persons, and perhaps even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mice are protected by law, their destruction, injury or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Flying Mouse Conservation Officer, calls on the public to help.
She said, “We have yet to know about our flying mice, and we do not know how many of them live.”
Ronaldo denies charges of rape, and his lawyers are going to trial the German journal.
Kristian Ronald denied the charges brought against him in rape, calling them "felical news", and claiming that people simply “want to own” using his name.
His lawyers are going to trial the German news magazine Spiegel, who published a charge against the footballist.
Forvard Portugal and Juventus were accused of rapeing the American on behalf of Catherine Mayorg, which allegedly took place in the Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, reported on Friday at Spiegel.
In a video in Instagram, where a football player has 142 million signatories, a few hours after reporting on the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo called this information a "feiky news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they told today is all the fake news, says the five-time winner Ballon d'Or on the camera.
“They just want to pry using my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous, my name says, but it's just part of their work.
I'm a happy man, and I've got a great one," adds a sportsman with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are prepared to file charges against Spygel, which they called “inadmissible information on confidentiality suspicions”, according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Shertz stated that the game was intended to seek compensation for “moral damage to the extent appropriate to the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
It is claimed that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
Having met at the night club, Ronald and Majorga reportedly returned to the playroom where he allegedly raped it in an annal form, according to documents submitted to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged Ronald accident, he fell on his knees and told her that he was “99 per cent of a good guy, but he was one percent worse.”
The documents claim that Ronald had confirmed that the couple had been engaged in sex, but that was in mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she has approached the police and that her trauma was photographed in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial solution because she felt “fears that she would be vindictive” and feared “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change her place of residence, as she continued to experience the painful feelings caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he went to the Italian giants Yuve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain “is sorry for automakers who have been lost forever”
The Minister of Business and Enterprise, Greg Clark, said that Britain would “suffer forever for this,” if Brexit would lose its world leader in the field of car production.
He also commented on the fact that Toyota UK reported to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker stated that the consequences of delays on the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could lead to job losses.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis plant in Bernaston produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped," says Marvin Cook, Managing Director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will close the Mini production plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, in the absence of a Brexit transaction, the supply chain would be at high risk, according to the autoproducer.
The Toyota production line is launched “in due time”, and the details for the cars produced for the order are supplied to UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If, on 29 March, Britain leaves the EU without a deal, there may be failures on the border which, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays and a lack of interest.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to keep the stocks at its plant in Derbishir for a longer period of one day, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's plan, which was announced in Checkers, on future relations with the EU, "was precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need a deal: we want to conclude a better agreement that will allow not only to succeed at present but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future," he told the BBC Radio 4 "Today".
“Not only Toyota, but also other producers claim that we must be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to specify the time limit for the production to be stopped, but in the longer term, it warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately reduce jobs.
Peter Cwallaris, who worked in Bernaston for 24 years and was head of the trade union, said that the concerns of members of the organization were growing: “On my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will no longer be able to return them”.
The representative of the Government said, “We have developed a precise and reliable plan of our future relations with the EU”.
The Tramp meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, according to the White House information
The responsible meeting of Donald Trampa with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “transferred to another week”, as the fight for Bretta Kawano's candidacy for the position of the Supreme Judge continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is sponsoring the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia's assistants, and the potential obstacles to justice by the President.
If the Trump of the Deputy Attorney-General were to resign, thereby endangering the independence of Muller, many months in Washington had been a cause for suspicion.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of the lead to record talks with Trump and the President's impossibility through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejects this information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House for a claim to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would “do not” to free Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the Senate judicial committee, on which Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Kristina Blasi Ford gave evidence.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly inquiry into the complaints of the FBR in Kawano, which still held a full vote in the Senate.
Press Secretary Trampa, Sarah Sanders, gave a speech on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been appointed, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other events in the Supreme Court.”
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press on."
Some journalists challenge this claim: Sanders did not hold briefings at the White House since 10 September.
The leader Chris Walles was interested in why.
Sanders says that the lack of briefings is not called “an objection to the community” of television reporters, although she added, “I will not deny that they are playing in the audience”.
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The president meets more in response to journalists’ questions than any other president before him,” she added, but she did not bring the exact figures, “We have these figures.”
Sanders has assured that the briefings will continue, but “if the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.”
We are trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it's a worthy replacement for press briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions from the White House by attending open meetings or press conferences with high-level individuals.
The conference is a very rare one for the press alone.
The President ' s unusual conduct in front of the gathered journalists this week in New York may be the answer.
The Minister of Health addressed EU workers in Scotland with a letter on concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health asked EU staff working in the Scottish GHG to express their gratitude for the country's name and wish them to remain in their post after Brexit.
Gin Freeman, MSP, addressed staff less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the cost of making statements of status for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit continued during the summer, and this autumn a decision should be reached.
However, the British Government is also strengthening its preparation for a possible scenario with no transaction.
I know it must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.

Kristian Abercromby has undergone an emergency surgery in connection with a head injury
Michael A. from Tennessee reported that the Tennessee State Tigers semi-defencer, Christian Abercromby, had undergone an emergency operation, having suffered a head injury on Saturday after the beating of 31-27 in the battle with Vanderbilt Commodores.
The chief coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma was received shortly before the break.
"He went to the side line and just moved in," said Rid.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercromby oxygen on the sideline before placing it on the conveyors and taking it to medical examination.
The official representative of Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercromby had been operating at the Vanderbi Medical Centre.
Harris added that “there are no details of the type/degree of the trauma”, and in Tennessee they are trying to figure out when the trauma occurred.
For Abercromby, only in second grade, it was the first season of Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before the game, he successfully captured five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher herb collection when buying real estate in Britain.
In line with the new Tori plans, foreign buyers will receive a higher herb collection for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom and the additional funds allocated will be used to assist the homeless.
This step leads to the failure of Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
Increased herb collection will be taken from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Treasury expects it to raise up to 120 million pounds a year for homeless people
Foreign buyers will receive a higher return on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds allocated will be used to assist homeless people, which will be announced today by Teresa May.
This step is not in line with the efforts made by Corbin to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more accessible and to increase the income of citizens.
The increase in herb collection will be taken from individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds thus allocated should encourage the Government ' s efforts to assist homeless citizens.
The addition to the existing herb collection, including the increase introduced two years ago for the acquisition of secondary and rental housing, may amount to up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects that this step will allow up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new London real estate facilities are purchased by non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who purchase their first apartment to improve their housing conditions subsequently.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “stard cities” because of a large number of foreign buyers who, when buying housing here, spend most of their time abroad.
A new policy was developed a few weeks later after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in herb collection to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of undermining real estate prices by acquiring land, but not actually using them, and urged Ms. May to give up the quota for affordable housing in order to correct the “prudential housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rent control and the termination of unwarranted eviction.
He also wants to give local authorities more authority to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “Last year, I said that I dedicated my prime minister to the British dream to make life better with every new generation.
This includes solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is unfair that for non-British citizens as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as accessible to the British as it is to the job-loving.
For too many people, the dream of acquiring their own home has become too far away and the danger for some is too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run Scotland."
Boss Sunderland Club Jack Ross says that his “final goal” is to become a certain stage manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish gets pleasure from the re-establishment of the North-East Club, which is currently taking the third place in the first league, separating from the three-point championship.
This summer he moved to the Stage of Light after St. Mirren returned to the Scottish League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got the B cap, and everything," Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland said.
"But I grew up looking at my father and his childhood behind Scotland in Hampden, and that always drew me back.
However, this will only happen if I can become a successful club manager.”
The predecessors of Ross, the managers of Sunderland were also Dick Advokaat, David Moies, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gas Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic said he did not experience a trepidation of such authority names in such large clubs, having previously rejected the Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals.
“For me, success at this point will depend on whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.
According to its structure and possibilities, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," the coach said.
“Bring him out there is an easy task, but I will consider what I have done, only if I can get the club back.”
Ross has worked for only three years as a manager, first became an assistant manager in Dumbarton, then spent 15 months at the Hearts training station.
He then helped Alloa get up from the third level, and in the next season he took St Mirren out of the lower positions of the winner of the championship.
Ross claims that he feels more comfortable today than ever during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably the present crossroads,” he recalls his responsible work in Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that management was more suitable than a game.
That sounds strange, because I did everything right, worked well on this job, and achieved some success.
But the game is more complicated.
There are a lot of things that need to be done every week.
I still have a lot of pressure on my job, but I feel good at being a manager.
I always wanted to lead, and now, by doing this, I feel most comfortable as a fish in the water for the rest of my adult life."
You can listen to a full interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30th, on the radio of Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 in English summer time.
According to the survey, 17:30 is the ideal time for beer pins
The summer heat increased the sale of British pubs, but reduced the sales in restaurants.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July and fell by 4.8 per cent in restaurants.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, who received this statistics, said: “Persistent solar activity, and longer than expected, participation by England in the world’s championship means that July continued the trend of the previous month, in June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, and in restaurants, on the contrary, significantly decreased”.
The fall in income in restaurant trade by 1.8 per cent was also continued in July.
The pubs and bars selling alcohol have shown much higher results compared in restaurants.
Dads who sell only food also suffered from the heat of the sun, although not as strong as restaurants.
It's hard to think that people want to jump on the street just to miss a bottle.
The sale of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% per month and food by 3%".
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM in the field of leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue to be the trend that we have observed since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sports activities remain critical when it comes to sales in the loss market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, as sales drop of 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly painful due to the ongoing price pressure.
The long hot summer has proved to be as never before for food operators and not yet the fact that August, bringing more moderate temperatures, will provide such a necessary transition.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including reopening, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowing down of branding.
Sectoral sales monitoring Coffer Peach Tracker for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes the productivity of 47 networks with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds of sterling and is a recognized industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has a secret account on social networks that he hides from parents
According to the survey, every fifth child, some of whom are 11 years old, has secret accounts on social networks that he hides from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of the Facebook Insta pages
This news raised concerns about sexual content
Twenty per cent of students say they have a “basic” account that parents know about
However, each fifth child, some of whom are 11 years old, creates a set of accounts that he or she hides from adults.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of "instant" fake accounts, i.e. Instagram, a website for the exchange of photographs.
This news raised concerns about publications of a sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of students said they had a basic, “clean” account that had access to their parents, but they also had secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally had access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, turned to a teenager who called on others to “strengthen him”.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent Directors of Schools (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles in their neighborhoods, and half of them recognized that one of them was usually secret.
HMC head Mike Bukenen says: “Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and this is an alarming fact.”
Elid Doyle will become the "voice of sportsmen" of Scotland's light athletics.
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Elid Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scotland's Light Athletics as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle, Scotland's most titled sportsman on light athletics. President Yen Bitty argues that this step is an excellent opportunity for athletes to take advantage of the extensive experience of athletes at the international level over the past decade.
“Helid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world Latvian community, and we are confident that it will benefit greatly from its participation in the light athletics in Scotland,” Bithy says.
Doyle says, “I try to be the voice of sportsmen, and I hope that I can make a real contribution and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 games in Atlanta, has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and now works as a regular commentator on BBC, has lost his ability to walk after the stroke.
He writes in his Twitter: "The month ago, I had an stroke.
I've lost my ability to move.
The doctors said it would only take time to see if I could fix it, and if so, to what extent.
It was an exhausting job, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I am practicing the craft!
Thank you so much for your support."
Advertising of milkfats in which feeding mothers compared to cows divided the views of internet users
The dairy production company caused Internet disputes, publishing an ad that compared breast-feeding mothers to breast-feeding cows.
By placing on the market, as it is said, “the world’s first sound-free breast milk pump,” the consumer technology company Elvie published an ad music video that demonstrates the freedom that the new milk pump provides to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in the full shadow of a cow under a musical track, which has the words, "Yes, I'm feeding my own milk, but you won't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a trade, it's my breast."
And also, 'We feed and we feed our young ones with milk; we feed and we feed.'
This advertising role, which was published on the company's Facebook page, provoked Internet disputes.
77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments: the video has received a mixed response from the audience, and many say it sheds light on the “fears” of the dairy industry.
“It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and born to produce milk, except that their children are taken to them for a few days after birth," says one user.
Milk sauce Elvie is directly dressed under a special bottler (Elvie/Mother)
And here's another comment: "It's probably as traumatic for both mothers and children.
But why not use them to advertise milk sauce for mothers who leave their children? "
Another user adds: “Reasoned from reality”.
Others, on the other hand, protected the role, and one woman even wrote that the song was “very beautiful”.
"I think that's a great idea.
If I were to feed a kid, I'd have to buy one.
The breast-breeding really made me feel like a cow.
Of course, the advertisement is a little sloppy, but that's what it feels like.
The generic product,” wrote one user.
And another comment: “A high-end advertisement that is intended for mothers who breast-feed (often they do it directly at their workplaces or in toilets) and who, in fact, feel a little “boiled.”
It's not for us to admire or abuse our dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with these undetected milky milk sauces hidden under the bisthalts.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breast - feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk sauce is completely insensitive, has no pipes or pipes, is free to be placed in the bistugalt for feeding, while it is unintentionally allowing women to move, hold a baby and even go out in the street during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and expert on early development of Mother’s children, comments: “The Elvie Molocotsos is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative advertising.
By making a parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast-feeding and all its problems, thereby demonstrating in a slender and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that gives the new milk pump.
It's not the first time that Elvie's milk sauce falls into the headlines of the news.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children appeared at the designer’s stage, Marta Jacobovski, using this product for appointment.
Hundreds of migrant children were safely moved to the tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained migrants has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to locate children to the ambassadors.
Usually most sponsors themselves are the same immigrants who do not have documents and are afraid to put their presence in the country under the authority of the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential ambassadors and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had been asked to take the leave of minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been tried before.
“Approximately 80 per cent of the persons who are both contracting parties or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a significant part of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
We therefore continue to persecute these people," Olbens said.
In an attempt to speed up the process of child training, officials introduced new rules that some of them had to appear before the court within a month of detention, not after 60 days as before.
In order to claim their legal status as an immigration judge, many of them are present on video, not on their own.
Those deemed to have no right to help will be quickly deported.
According to shelter and information workers who have appeared in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to be alarmed or depressed, which may lead to the explosions of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them the emotional time to prepare for it or to say good - bye to friends can exacerbate the trauma many of them are fighting.
Syria orders the US, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw the troops
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Valid al-Moual also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that war had already taken place in the country for the eighth year.
Moala, also a Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegal in Syria on the pretext of combating terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without any conditions,” he said to the assembled.
Mualam insists that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions of people have been expelled from their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” by terrorist groups and “lovely illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and consulting both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs, who speak against the President of Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 military personnel in the war-affected country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been established for their return and accused “some Western countries” of “dissemination of irrational insurance”, which urged refugees to stay outside the country.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what must be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to recover until the political agreement on the end of the war between Asada and the opposition is reached.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major round of Idlib rebels has provided an opportunity for further political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented the widespread assault by the Russian-supported Syrian forces in a province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had a “clear deadline”, and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadians, including those from the Al-Qaida front of Nusra, who would “be destroyed”.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hoped that the first meetings of the new committee would soon be convened, consisting of representatives of the Government and the opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Mulam outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, stating that the work of the Commission should be limited to “the consideration of existing articles of the Constitution” and a warning against interference.
Why Trump wins the second term
In line with this logic, Mr. Trump will win the election again in 2020 if the impression and scandal do not pre-complete his presidency, and that is what many liberals are likely to hope for.
And this will, of course, be "the very dramatic finale of the presidency for all history!"
At this point, there is no sign of vision.
Since 2014, the premium-time ratings have increased by more than twice — up to 1.05 million per CNN and nearly three times — to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million premium viewers compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has exceeded cable channel ratings by collecting 3.5 million viewers in the evenings during the main news show.
"This is a fire to which people are drawn, because it's outside our understanding," says Neil Barr, director of ABC's "Appointed Survivor" drama, as a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, who becomes president after Capital is destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Skowell, a long-published comedian writer and author, “Only funny: some unpleasant truths about entering the Club of Hollywood Boys” offers another theory.
She recalls once driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, “Yes, because he is ridiculous.”
There is something valuable in all this chaos — it's fun.
Of course, unlike the rest of the content broadcast on television, Washington's news headlines can determine the future of Rou v. Wade and answer questions about the integration of immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
The exception is a luxury that only privileged audiences can afford.
And yet, when you look at the six-hour series of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of a "deep background" for his Strah book, or about Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 from a stripe of skin (a suit, heated with pride), as Washington Post writes, or about a sharp description of Storm Daniels, let's say, Mr. Trump's anatomy is already out of the ordinary information.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“Frequently his job is to make us feel that the reality of the show is that it feeds you every night,” says Brand Montgomery, Executive Director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the Pawn Stars on the changing actor's composition of the Tramp show and the day-to-day turn of the issue (the dragon with N.F.L., praise Kim Chen Ihn).
You can't let yourself miss any episode, or you've left hopelessly.
When I contacted Mr. Fles this week, on the northern coast of Kauai there were 27 degrees hot, the sun lit, but he hid inside his home and watched the MSNBC during the CNN recording.
He could not get rid of the screen, at least not exactly when they showed how Brett Cavano was brought before the Legal Committee of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows, people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," says Mr. Fles.
“Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out that they were right.”

Foreign money is involved in the worst interlocutory elections leading to the White House
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is receiving cash flows through the change of districts in Congress, where two officials are in the race for the same place.
This beautiful Pittsburgh area, whose geography has not been changed for a long time, supports democracy, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Connor Lamb, which took place in another district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is speaking against another active official, the Republic of China, Rotfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is substantially in contact with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the election of the old areas had resulted in violations of the Constitution to the Republicans.
The Honka in the new 17th district sparked a heated debate on financing campaigns among the main financial forces, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name of Lemba became known in Pennsylvania after the victory with a small difference in the March special elections in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by the Republicans for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump has won the district with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give the democracies little advantage.
United States of America ordered El Salvador to support China, but then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had caused the negative reaction of Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varello, President of Panama. He was also in Panama until the partners expelled the management team of the Trump organization.
The representatives of the Department decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition”, the Press Secretary of Hezer Nawert said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed criminal sanctions, including reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions, would be painful for that country in Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
In the light of the regular internal meetings of North and Central America, representatives postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was scheduled to be held to conduct a similar meeting last year, which took place as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, the high-level representatives of the Administration realized that they wanted the preparation of the conference to take place, and had effectively discontinued consideration of the question of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to the diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October and will be attended by Vice-President Mike Pens, indicating that the Administration is of real importance to this meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives were well returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, not bringing any new cruel messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate that had been discussed by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues subject to anonymity.
Their reports also confirm the background of an anonymity analysis of the administration.
Study History
The next step could be to report to Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possible impediment to Mr. Tramp's justice, as there is very substantial evidence in the public reports.
Mr. Muller also reportedly began to investigate the facts of the trump campaign with Russia and its attacks during the past elections.
If the Congress changes the owner, Mr. Trump will appear before the person responsible in that body, just as he is ready to speak again to voters, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
But there are many 'yes'; I do not want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to set up a coup and overthrow Hitler, and this would happen if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we have not done so, and we have missed the opportunity to avoid bloodshed in the years to come.
The course of history is being developed at such points, and the impeccable march of democracy is being accelerated or suspended.
The Americans are experiencing some of these fragile moments right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls Mr. Muller's fate?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, he proposed to make secret records last year on the activities of the President and discussed his inappropriate position.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that The Times is not true.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Cavano is not complete or true, or if it is still approved by the Supreme Judge despite the merit of being accused of sexual harassment and false testimony?
First of all, will we in the medium term vote for the Congress, which will bring Mr. Trump to justice?
If we do not pass these tests properly, this winter will prove to be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we can get through them with the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovenian Jew, who lived in the same Nazi regime in Osvenci, whose officials once occupied a post office where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later I was led to the burning of Saturday candles on the table with a swastika symbol.
With such a family past as I can't be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior scientist at the Brookings Institute, is chairman of the City of Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of the book The Last Palace: The troubled Age of Europe in the history of five lives and one legendary home.
Grem Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about the Venna Rapids football match.
Rangers take the Venice Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after an impressive victory in Spain over the "Villareal" at the beginning of this month, will allow them to take strong positions in the G League of Europe group.
For the first time, the knee trauma has prevented Grim Dorrans from speaking to anyone in the season with 2:2 against "Villareala", but he believes that "Renders" can use this result as a tramp to achieve great results.
"That was a good time for us, because "Villareal" is a good team," said a 31-year-old footballer.
“We went into the game, thinking we could get something, and we got out of nobody.
Maybe at the end of the day, we could do it, but in general, nothing was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first time, and our success came to the second time where we were better.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be a difficult game because they showed a good result in their last game, but given the support of the patients, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly a difficult one, taking into account all my injuries and replacements at the club itself, but now there is a good factor in this place.
It's made wonderfully better, and the kids really get the pleasure from it; the workouts went to the clock.
I hope we can move forward, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of fear of their pension stocks
Despite the fact that the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few had talked about it with members of their family.
About half of the people involved in national studies said that they had discussed the value of long-term care with their wives.
However, only 10% said that they talked to their children about the subject.
“People want them to care about someone in the family, but they don’t try to discuss the subject with them,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide for Life Insurance.
And that's exactly what we need to start with.
Speak to your wives and children. You may not be able to prepare your family for what they may have to care for you if you do not speak beforehand.
Discuss with your consultant and family where and how you will get medical assistance, as this choice may be an important cost factor.
Consult your financial consultant: he will help you develop a payment plan for this expenditure.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own property, provided you have money.
Put your legal instruments in order: get rid of legal battles.
Build trust in medical care and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and monitor that specialists do your wishes if you cannot communicate.
We also recommend considering the possibility of financial confidentiality.
You should choose a trusted person who will help you make financial decisions and monitor your accounts if you prove incapacitated.
Don’t forget, too, that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Can you then provide information on what medication he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on the paper so that you can prepare for each case.
Martin adds, “It is important not only to have a financial, but also to choose a doctor.”
‘What medicines are you taking?
Who will take care of your dog?
Build up and write down the plan."
In Ilfracombe, the man fired several times from the pneumatic blower
The man fired several times from the pneumatic blower, returning home from the walk.
The victim, whose chest, life, and hand had been shot, was 40 years old in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 in English summer time, as “a coincidence”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The wounds are not life-threatening, and the police are now searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunamis that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
As a result of the exit of the communications, rescuers cannot obtain any information from Donghal, a region north of Pala, which is close to the magnitude of the earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Pala as a result of the natural disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Pala and Dongala located on the island of Sulavesi:
Pala, the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 (given for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a district extending 300 km (180 miles) from the coast to the north-west of the island of Sulavesi.
The district, the administrative area of the smaller province, had 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Central Sulavesi, and in particular the coastal region of Dongala.
The production of nickel is also important for the province ' s economy, but mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster management agency, over the past 100 years, tsunamis have been devastating to Pala and Dongal several times.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Cunami also occurred in the western part of Dongala in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Volcanic Fire Engine and is suffering from earthquakes on a regular basis.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra on 26 December caused the tsunamis that devastated 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The follow-up to the severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of 6.8 hit south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing tsunamis on the southern coast, resulting in the deaths of some 700 people.
2009: Earthquake 7.6 occurred in the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake of 7.5 hits occurred on one of Mentawa Island in Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters [10 m] that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The weak earthquake hit the Pidi Jai district in Acheha, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake in 2004 and tsunamis.
The tsunami did not happen this time, but more than 100 people were killed as a result of the destruction of the buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes have taken place on the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, resulting in the deaths of more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained in ruins for a time.
Senior son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Trak Pailin, the eldest son of former Governor Alaska and vice-candidate of President Sara Pailin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Pailin from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, including the situation of domestic violence and the opposition of the arrest, according to a statement issued by the Alaskan police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up the phone.
According to KTUU, Pailin is in the Mat-Su insulator and will be released at $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when he was asked whether he was guilty, he declared his “unique innocence”.
Pailin is threatened with three minor Class A crimes, which means that he may be deprived of liberty for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with the offence of Class B, which was sentenced to imprisonment for up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
That's not the first case when criminal charges were brought against Pailin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Aliski Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, reporting on domestic violence and the storage of arms in the state of alcohol abuse in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed to have hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016, after explaining her son’s harsh behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder, which was allegedly caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died as a result of an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
Earthquake of 7.5 balls caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place not far from the central Sulavesi, which is located north-east of the capital of Jakarta Indonesia.
There are video recordings on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in Palo when the tsunamis broke down on the beach.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office wants to bring a rare death sentence to the suspect in New York.
The Federal Prosecutor ' s Office in New York seeks a death penalty for Saifolo Saipova, suspected of committing a terrorist in New York, resulting in the death of eight persons, a rare punishment for a federal crime that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, a 30-year-old, reportedly took a ride to the Home Depot to attack the West Side Road in Lower Manhattan, riding pedestrians and bicycles.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intendedly” killed eight people and “intendedly” caused serious bodily damage, according to the notification of the intention to obtain the death penalty in the South of New York.
According to the court, the two charges may result in a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury had read Saipov ' s conviction with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for rockets commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and car destruction.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “intensely planned and intentional”, Saipov carried it out, as described, “disgustingly, cruelly and criminally”.
"Syfullo Habibullaevich Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lora Decadta, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlie, Erna Ferruci, Erna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnukko," says the announcement of intentions.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since a death penalty was imposed by the prosecutor in the South District of New York for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, the accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug addicts, but ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty for the federal case in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to a contract for espionage in favour of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Rosenbergi was punished with the use of an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to Saipov's court documents, the native of Uzbekistan demonstrated that there was no injury after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired by the video IGIL on the phone to be attacked.
He also asked the IGIL to hang the flag in his hospital room, the police reported.
He denied his guilt on all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on the side of Saipov, said that they were “clearly disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, not the life sentence, without the possibility of release, will only exacerbate the pain of those events for all their participants,” Patton said.
The defence of Saipova had previously appealed to prosecutors not to seek a death penalty.
A member of Parliament from Tori says that NAYJEL FARAZ should not be responsible for negotiations on Brexit
Today, during a protest at the Tori Nigel Faraz conference, he vowed to “mobilize the people’s army”.
Former leader Ukip said that policies should “sympathize” with the Eurosceptics, as one of the members of Parliament in Teresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bown, said at a meeting in Birmingham that Britain would have been "out", if Mr. Faraz had been Secretary of Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Mrs. May, in trying to reconcile her deep-separate ranks, is further exacerbated by the fact that the members of the Tori Party, who are opposed to leaving the EU, join a separate protest against Brexit that is taking place in the city.
The Prime Minister of all forces is trying to preserve his compromise plan, which is being sounded in Checkers in the crackdown by Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insist that she continue to try to conclude a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between its package and its chaos.
Mr. Bown said at the Leave Means Leave (I mean to survive) meeting in Solihalle, which he wants to “play the Checkers”.
He suggested that Mr. Faraz be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"Had he been responsible, we would have left," he said.
Member Wellingboro added: "I will continue to speak for Brexit, but we need to play the Checkers."
Addressing the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country."
Mr. Boun rejected the assumption that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their opinion and wanted to remain is totally inconsistency.”
Brexit from the Tori Andrea Jenkins party was also at the meeting, giving reporters such a comment: “I say: Prime Minister, just listen to people.”
“Chequeror is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also unpopular among the members of our party and our activists, who are actually pushing the streets and, above all, choosing us.
Please put the Checkers aside and listen to what they say."
In her abstention to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers remain in their work if they are faithful to their promises.”
Mr. Faraz said that if policies are to be handed over to the 2016 referendum, they would have to be “recognised”.
“This is now a matter of confidence between us, people, and our political class,” he says.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say, "We're not going to let this go of your hands."
Addressing a stubborn crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit’s betrayal, to feel a void.
“We are mobilizing the national army of this country, giving us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit's opponents took a demonstration on Birmingham, followed by a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists blew the Tori v. Brexit posters into these exits.
At the opening of the conference, a member of the Labour Party, Lord Adonis criticised the conservators for security problems in the mobile annex of their party.
“And these people claim that they can set up IT systems and technology Canada plus, for border work, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"This is one of the broad sides.
The good Brexit does not exist in principle," he said.
Warren plans to “search closely” the opportunity to participate in the presidential race
A member of the U.S. Parliament Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections she would “determine the potential for the presidential ballot.”
The Boston Globe reports that the Massacuses democracy on Saturday told about its future at a meeting of rats in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trampa, is being bullied in November for a re-election against a member of the Republican Party of Jeff Dila, who was co-chaired by the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
Discussions are under way that it has the chance to take the position of the Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, she held a regular meeting with voters in Holioque; since Trump entered the post, it was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a rattush meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to be the president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to “start” our broken government, and for that to be a woman upstairs”.
As a result of the murder of Sims (student), the LSU was arrested
The Baton-Ruz police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder of LSU Wade Sims, who took place on Friday, had been arrested.
At 11:00 a.m., at a press conference, the Baton-Ruz police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department published a video shooting with a request to help identify the person who was able to download the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot around the campus of the South University on Friday morning.
“Wayd Simms got a gunshot wound in his head, which ended it,” the officer of the Murphy J. Paul police told reporters on Saturday.
Wade joined his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was involved in the incident, had weapons and shot at Wade Sims.
With the arrest of Simpson, he did not resist and was detained in the East Baton-Ruz police department.
A young man grew by 1 m 82 cm in Baton Rose, played in 32 games with 10 starters in the past season and took on an average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 teams.
Gran Pri russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the command tactics have given him victory over Sebastian Fettel
Since Walter Botts had been qualified on Saturday, Louis Hamilton encouraged, it became clear that the Mercedes command tactics played a major role in the race.
He was well-started by the middle-wing botts, and he was practically out on Hamilton when he defended his position on the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammates.
The fettel first went to the pi-stop, leaving Hamilton in the tail of the whole group, a choice that was crucial.
Mercedes went to the foot one round later, and then went behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some fighting “wheel in the wheel”, stepped forward, which led to the failure of the Ferrari driver to leave the inner space free, risking being stuck after a double movement to protect on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back of a series of networks and was in the seventh place until the end of the first round.
Then he took most of the race, held on to his native tires, in order to quickly finish, subjugated Kimy Rickconen to fourth place.
As a result, he went to the footpath at the 44th round, but could not increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds, as Rickconen took fourth place.
The day was difficult because Walter had done fantastic work on the exits and had shown the present glory by sharing it with me.
The team has done such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in stock," Hamilton said.
Tag language of the handbook
President Donald Trump criticised Senator Diane Finnstein at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for her statement that she had not published a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, the prosecutor of Brett Cavano, a candidate for a senior judge, in sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention direct testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, he said that the Senate had shown that the participants of these events were “slow, ugly and false people”.
“The only possible response to all of this, and what is happening in the Senate in the last few days, is wonderful, it’s anger, anger, hatred, and lies,” he said.
'You see all these running away,' they will say, 'No, I did not do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Finnstein, did you "sing" the information?
Remember her answer... did you send the document information? - What?
Oh, no.
I didn't swear.
Yes, stop.
We, what, did we "slid"?...No, we didn't "slid", he added with the Senator's ink.
In July, Finnstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Mr. Ford against Cavano, and in early September it was unlawfully announced, but Finnstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I did not share her information,” The Hill told the Committee.
“She asked me to keep this information in secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the charges in the run-off was apparently not pleasing to the president, who commented on this during the Saturday session: "This is what I will tell you: The language of the body has brought it to light.
Maybe she didn't "scream," but the language of the body was worse than I've ever seen."
By continuing to protect his candidate from the position of a Supreme Judge, accused by three women in sexual harassment, the President assumed that the Democrats were using those charges for their own purposes.
“They certainly try to regain power in all the available ways.
We observe shame, ill will, no matter who they try, through whom they must go beyond to gain power and control," the President quoted the Mediaite as saying.
British elite hockey league: Dandi Schart 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for the Giants in the game against Dandi.
In the game of the elite hockey league, Dandi Schart was paid for a Friday defeat against Belfast Giants, won a response match on Saturday with a 5-3 account for Dandi.
"Jeants" received an early two-goal victory due to the beatings of Patrick Duyer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the home team before Duyer took the Giants out to the leaders.
François Bushar compared Dandi's account before the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
For the people of Adam Kif, who won the "Dandi" with the account 2:1 in Belfast on Friday evening, it was the third defeat in the Elith League season.
Among the parties was the fourth meeting in the season when the Giants won three previous matches.
Duyer's first goal came at the fourth minute at 3:35 after Kendall McFall's bare passport, with David Rezerford's support, after which Bovilleer doubled the advantage four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the owners to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markvardt trained Couni to balance the account at 15:16.
Duyer was satisfied that the Giants took the initiative at the first break when he shot the second goal at night at the end of the first period.
The master regrouped, and Bushar reassessed the account, killing the target with a number of shifts at 27:37.
Connie and Charles Corcoran were united to help Nilsen to give Dandi the first chance for the match to take the lead at the end of the second period, after which he and his team won, holding rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five matches, are currently being sent to Milton-Caines for the next match to take place on Friday.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people aboard the plane could avoid earthquakes
The Indonesian airman was sentenced to death by a hero after he deliberately went to death to allow hundreds of passengers to fly well.
More than 800 people died and many lost their lives as a result of a severe earthquake on the island of Sulavesi on Friday.
Strong underground thrusts continue to destroy the area, many of the inhabitants of Palu have fallen under the roofs of the buildings.
Although his colleagues were saved by escape to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the horrendous airport of Mutiara Ces Al Jufrei, the city of Palu.
He remained in his seat to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then in the airfield, could safely fly.
Then, when he was shown that the tower was being demolished, he pushed it away.
Later he ended up in the hospital.
Indonesia's air navigation representative Johannes Sirait stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian Agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to deliver it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatch ended before the helicopter was able to sit in Pala.
"We are very sorry for this loss," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of people killed as a result of the earthquake may reach thousands because, according to the disaster management agency, access to the cities of Donghal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is probably growing, as a large number of people are still under siege, and many have not been able to get out of there,” says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The volunteers, whose heights were six meters [6 m] high, devastated the city of Palu, where the mass funeral of the dead will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: “A quick help will bring the victims every minute.
Clean water's not enough.
The mini-markets are everywhere.
Jan Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, tells CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross workers are already coming to the rescue, but we do not know that they will remain there.
Tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but it can all be much worse.”
The president of Indonesia, Joco Vidodo, arrived in Pala on Sunday and spoke before the armed forces of the country, in particular, said: “I ask you all to work day and night to fulfill all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered from an earthquake in Lomboca, resulting in more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niguini now reports that one person has disappeared without taking a plane crash into the lagoon
The airline, which was engaged in a traffic crash in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person was missing while it was said that all 47 passengers and crew were well off.
Air Niguini reported that as a Saturday, she had no information about one male passenger.
The airline stated that it cooperated with the local authorities, hospitals and police, attempting to find this person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and aircraft crew after he fell on the water trying to land at Chuk Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The causes of the disaster and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
The airlines and the U.S. V.S. say that the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the airfield.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft was unable to land on the airfield.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes says the plane's getting on the airfield is too low.
"And that's very good," Janes adds.
Janes told me that he and other passengers had been able to access the crash exits on a ton plane, since the water level was on the belt.
He also said that the stewards panicked and shouted on board and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S.U.S. reports that mariners repairing the vicinity also helped to rescue by using an inflated boat on which they transported people to the shore before the aircraft was loaded in about 30 metres (100 feet).
Air Safety Networks show that over the last two decades, 111 people have been killed in aircraft with aircraft registered in PNG, but none of these have been affected by Air Niguini.
An analysis of the findings could prove the fact that the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the charge was brought against the man accused of burning the Mississippi resident in 2014.
The analysis of the United States Department of Justice, Paul Roulette, gave a long-term testimony as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the department how he used cell phone records to provide a general picture of the action of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette explained that he had received data on the location of these people on several mobile phones; according to this data, Televis spent the evening with Chambers, which was contrary to his previous testimony, reported The Clarion Ledger.
He said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information received, his cell phone was close to Chambers; when the situation became clear, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his demonstrations, Sanford said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was right, claiming that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that “it was a lie, because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
However, the telephone records indicate that they were only called within one week.
Roulette also showed that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, her text messages, phone calls and contact information were removed from her phone.
"He's the star of her life," says Hale.
Protection should begin to set out its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a "unaware hip-hop"?
Three hip-hoppers are going to fight negatively with this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed Group in Bristol argues that hip-hop content has changed by removing the original political and social problems.
The group wants to return to their roots and again make the “incognito” hip-hop popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons recently witnessed a return to Britain by such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
One more black?
New York Ninja tried a family couple because of a racist smms
The New York nuns filed a family marriage for discrimination after receiving a communication from a woman with a complaint that the nun was “one more black”, which the woman mistakenly sent the nurse instead of her husband.
Spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the claim is “for the purpose of extortion”.
Lucy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern, knowing that the new bride offered by the childcare service, Giselle Morris, was black when she came to the family on her first working day in 2016.
“NOEEEEEEEEET, so much so, one more black,” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flexman to her husband.
Instead of sending a text message to her husband, however, she twice mistakenly sent his wife, Maurice.
Aware of her plight, Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, saying in his service that an African-American nun had done a bad job, and that they were expecting a Filipino, not an African-American, reported New York Post.
Maurice paid for one day's work and then went home to Uber.
Now, Morris goes to court for a family couple and demands compensation for a discharge of $350 per day for six months, under the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, were not entered into by any contract.
“I want them to understand: such things are not allowed,” she said on Friday, adding, “And I know that it is discrimination.”
Spouses disagree with the accusation of racism and claim that the discharge of Morris can be considered a reasonable step, as if they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she really didn’t mean anything.
She's not racist.
"We are not racist," said Joe Plasco, a post.
"But would you trust someone with whom you had no desire, even if you had no desire to do so?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on, let's go!"
Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child only two months ago and was in “a difficult situation”.
"Are you willing to follow the man who has been in this state?
Not very nice of you," added a bank employee specializing in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but the public opinion has already given its judgment on social networks, accusing a couple of unacceptable behaviour and logical problems.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not be able to walk with a speaking bear, says a new letter.
The daughter of Bonda, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented on the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of the first reader, even before it is published.
It's very fun to know that Paddington has a huge success."
She also told her father that before he decided to write a children's book about a nursing home, she had worked with an operator on the BBC and that she would refuse to publish with optimism and added that the 60-year-old anniversary of his book was “and joyful and bitter” because their author had not become their author in the past year.
As for Paddington, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family”, and her father quietly boasted that his character had finally gained knowledge.
"He was a quiet and modest man," his daughter tells him.
“Now Paddington was so real to him, and for his father it was almost as if his own child had made a success: he was proud of them, although he did not really consider it a success of his own.
I think he was referring to the success of Paddington in that way.
Subdington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always gave due credit to the bear.”
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After her plane was landed, her daughter was delivered to Niccia Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad called regularly and said that it was really bad that something went wrong," said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
“So he called again and said that she was going to die in the next two minutes, and that we had to say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually stopped acting by abandoning her body.
She died earlier than she expected.
I should have just sat down and waited, knowing everything was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold my hand firmly."
At the end of the day, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz, the grief of losing her daughter, landed on the plane with other passengers, calming down the huge loss she had just had to survive.
"No one knew what happened," she says.
"My head came up, I didn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but it's just during the flight that I've been trying to experience this overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who have suffered the loss of loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide try to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey are setting up openings on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Ms. Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he began to experience depression, and at the age of 18, he died with him.
“I don’t want other parents to experience what I experience every day,” she says.
The 45-year-old Davis in Lidney tells us that her son was a great cause and had a fucking captivating smile.
"They all loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, it was like a light burning in the room."
However, before he died, he left work because he was in the most terrible time of his life.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler, the last of whom, at the time, was 11 years old, found his own brother.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am not going to stop being afraid of a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis has come up with these openings, "maybe people knew there's someone to talk to, even if it's your friend.
You cannot sit down and remain silent, and you must speak to people."
Mrs. Hamfriz, who has been with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, who has lived with him for 15 years, and he did not become his mother soon after his death.
“He didn’t say that he felt depressed, upset, or something like that,” she says.
“In a few days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his attitude.
It was a very bad thing for him to be born; he did not look at his children when they opened their gifts.
She says that his death was a huge injury to them, but they had to go through it, that event shocked our family.
It broke her into pieces.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Future Bretta Cavano height: FBI launches investigation
“I thought that if we could get something of what he asked for – an investigation limited by time and volume, we could bring even a little unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would “break up” on the background of a growing party chain reaction.
Why didn't Mr. Kawano and his Republican proponents want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the reason for their fluctuations.
The interim elections will take place only five weeks after 6 November, and if, as is expected, all will be bad for the Republic, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to obtain the person they want and to elect him as the Supreme Judge of the country.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying for Mr. Kawano, who had worked in the White House for Mr. Bush in his time, and who had met with his future wife Ashley, then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI publishes its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
To date, it is not clear whether Mr. Kawano will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pens to address the issue of equality of vote and to confirm his candidacy as a Supreme Judge.
The number of North Korean refugees dropped by Kim
Since Kim Chen Yin came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has decreased, the South Korean legislator said.
Pak Bion Seug, referring to the South Ministry, stated that, compared to the 2706 escapes recorded in 2011, this figure decreased to 1127 cases last year.
Mr. Pack said that the key factors had become the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher rates taken by smugglers who were exporting people.
There are no comments from the public.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean refugees are finally offered the nationality of South Korea.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a securely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often is subject to forced repatriation.
The relationship between the North and the South, still in war, has improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Beijing to resume negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This took place after the June historic meeting of the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump and Kim Chen Inn, in Singapore, at which they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Rie Yun Ho, accused the United States of obstructing progress in this matter.
“If we do not have at least the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will never be able to begin disarmament unilaterally,” Mr. Rei said in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavano “esterical” and claims that he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the Palace of Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kawano, a candidate for a senior judge, “esterical” and said that he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t imagine that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave like this, she would be immediately referred to as “a hysterical”,” Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony of Kawano in the Senate Legal Committee, given to them on Thursday.
Kawano emotionally denied the charges of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford in sexual harassment, which allegedly occurred when they were both teenagers.
Kawano spoke emotionally enough, sometimes even screaming and breathing, telling about his family and his school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the Democrats of the Committee, calling charges against him “grostic and well-planned killing of the active person”, organized by the Liberals, who were charged with losing the 2016 presidential election by Hillary Clinton.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Kawano's arguments only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was prejudicial to the Democrats.
“I think he is disqualifying himself with his allegations, as well as with the way he falls on Clintons and Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was upset when she was asked if she was trying to bring Kawano to justice if his guilt was confirmed and if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House.
“I will say this: if he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only worthy of the Supreme Court, but also of the court where he is now,” Pelosi said.
Kawano is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeal D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kawano regarding the Access to Medical Services Act or Rou v. Wade, since she was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Kawano raised the question whether it would be possible to repeal some decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time to let an excruciating and presumptuous man into the position of the Supreme Judge, and to cry out, 'How beautiful!'," said Pelosi.
And women should own it.
It is righteous anger, months, and years of anger; it cannot pass through without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," said Miss Stein 45 later.
"I don't think that's as unusual as you think?"
She continued: "The woman who worked for me in the leadership, she said that she also wept when she was angry, but developed a technique that she explained to her companion: "You can think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really worried."
And then she just kept talking.
I was deeply impressed by this approach.”
The tears are allowed as an exit to anger, partly because they are being treated incorrectly in the roots.
One of my most painful memories of the first work in the office where men dominated: I once cried out of anger, but I was caught by an old woman, a heartless manager I was always afraid of, and pulled out on a battalion cell.
"Never let them see how you cry," she told me.
They do not know that you cry for evil.
They think you're upset, and they're glad you finally got you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from the Democratic People of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential elections.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught up in some unserious intrigue and got out of the race, and Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason for her to remain in the President ' s position.
“This decision was not considered,” she said with a smile 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates already in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Beloznejka and seven assholes."
The campaign had already come to an end, it had left a lot of money behind, and it had therefore sworn that it would not participate in the race unless it had raised $2 million.
It was said that it was a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who had offered $1,000 to men, had offered her only 250.
"What am I to them, a precious commodity, or what?" she wondered.
When she spoke, she declared that she would not be conducting an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions — the gratitude of the people who supported her, the disappointment of the system that made it so difficult to collect money and access to voters, and by the anger of discrimination on the grounds of sex that she was breathing.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
“It was possible to think that Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what would they write on my memoir?
"She cried without end?"
How a trade war with America can be useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first wave of trade war between the United States and China was deafening, and although the battle was still far from final, the gap between countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made the first warning early this year, imposing a tax on basic Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when the new tariffs affected goods of $200 billion (150 billion) and actually taxed half of all goods coming from China.
Beijing has every time suffered an equivalent response, recently setting US$60 billion to $10 per cent.
China promised that responses to the United States would be equal every time, and the world's economy would hardly begin to experience at least the smallest difficulties in the near future.
To force Washington to resign means to resign, but to give up the United States in public would be too careful for Si Xinpin, President of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing is able to play its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to economic shock in any of these countries is in fact much more dangerous than previously recognized observers,” says Abigail Grace, a research officer of the Center for New American Security, who specializes in Asia.
Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “ready” to return refugees
Syria claims that it is ready to return to the refugees voluntarily and is seeking help in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
At the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valid al-Mual, reported that conditions in the country had improved.
“Today’s situation on the ground has become more stable and secure due to the success of counter-terrorism efforts,” he said.
The Government continues to restore destroyed areas by terrorists so that people can live there peacefully.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave due to terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mual said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for the assistance in restoring the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not receive assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe Strengthens the Victory of Kubke Rider in Paris
The European team won Kubok Rider 2018, winning the US team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S.A. had already been played six times on European land, and the U.S. Cube Ryder had not been won since 1993.
Europe has returned to the crown thanks to Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's command, which has picked up 14.5 points they need to win over the United States.
The American Phil Mikelson star, who fought a lot of the tournament, made his first long shot in the water at the 16th hole of the pair-3, with his match Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds, became 1-x-4th players who had ever been 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit suffered a 5:4 defeat with the lowest score in the European team, Turbière Olesen of Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, resigned 2:1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have been participating in Kubque Ryder for the last time.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the Eight Cuban Rider, became the winner of a tournament for the whole history of Europe with 25.5 points for career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t hold back today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get a doll again.
It's all in the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," says Emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He hand over the flag to his associate John Rama, who won the victory on Sunday over the American legend of Golf Tiger Woods with a 2:1 account in a single game.
“I’m extremely proud of this victory,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These indicators are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all time who won the 14 main titles, with only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. assembly fought during all the exits, trying hard to win, and Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fina, who had a golf course throughout the whole tournament, were chosen.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furick said after his unremitting command: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we were able to touch Europe easily.
It didn't work.
We're filming the traps in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played great.
We are regrouping, I will work with the PGA of America and our Committee, Cuba Ryder, and we will move forward with success.
I love all 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be able to play.
We are the losers.’
Red Flood: News The concentration of micro-organisms has fallen in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasote
The last report of the Florida Commission on Fish and Wild Nature reflects a general decrease in the red river concentration in some parts of the Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Kolier, there is reports of abundance of color, which is a reduction in the concentration of micro-organisms.
The Red Flood extends approximately 130 miles from the North Pinell to the southern Li districts.
The sights can be seen in about 10 miles from the Hillsboro coast, but their number has decreased significantly over the past few weeks.
The red tide is also seen in the Pasco district.
Last week, the average concentration in the Pinellas district was reported and near it, from low to high concentration in the Hillsboro coastal zone, high concentration in the Manata and Sarasota districts and the coastal zones, medium concentration in the Charlotte district, high concentration on the coast of Li district, and low concentration in the Koller district.
In the Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Li and Kolier districts, there is still a likelihood of respiratory irritation.
No such probability was reported in North West Florida last week.
