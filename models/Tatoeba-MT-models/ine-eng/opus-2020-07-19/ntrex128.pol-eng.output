The members of the Walloon National Assembly are afraid to be called muppets.
Among some members of the National Assembly there was a conflict, which is the effect of the proposal to change their title to the members of the Walloon Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, in short MWP).
The idea was created in connection with the plans to change the assembly to the Walloon Parliament.
The members of the meetings on all sides of the political scene are concerned that they can become the subject of the kpin.
One of the parliamentarians from the Labour Party expressed concern about its grouping, saying that the new name is intertwined with the Welsh words 'twp' and 'pwp'.
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh the word "twp" means stupid, and the word "pwp" means departures.
One of Plaid Cimru's politicians found that his group was "unsatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
The Welsh Conservative Party member said that his party was "open" to change the name. However, he noted that the word "MWP" is very close to the word "muppet".
In this case, the waly letter "w" is similar to the letter "u" in the Yorkshire English dialect.
As part of the Committee's meeting, which is currently working on the draft Act amending the name, the following position was taken: "The final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will naturally belong to them".
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal.
In addition, the Commission supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the assembly to "Member of the Walloon Parliament", that is, WMP in English, although this short "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity in society.
The members of the assembly are proposing alternative solutions, and the difficulties in reaching consensus are a must for Elin Jones, the chairman of the assembly, who should present the bill in the next few weeks.
The Act introducing reforms will also take into account other changes in the way in which the assembly works, including the rules of withdrawal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the discussion of the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
In the coming week, the voters will decide whether their country will bear the name of the Republic of North Macedonia soon.
The general vote is intended to help bring about a lasting dispute with neighboring Greece, in which the region is called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour is a territorial claim and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Mr Ivanov, President of Macedonia, and the opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that he would consider the results of the vote.
However, the plebiscite voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the amendment is necessary to enable the State to join the European Union and NATO.
Call in the New York church of St. Martin's Milk in connection with the problems of the fallen church in Harlem
“The older people I talk to say that there was a bar and church in every corner in the past,” said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no sign of them at all."
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are currently sharing in a different way," he observed.
"The bars have ceased to be the place of regular meetings of members of the community."
In the case of churches, it is, however, dead that the means of sale of the property are not sufficient for the time being as determined by the decision-makers, and that “they will be in the exit point sooner or later”.
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartments inhabited by people who would not support other surrounding temples.
As he said: “The approaching majority of those who buy apartments in such buildings will be the white race. This will accelerate the total closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by the gathering of white believers, before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the church of St. Marcina joined the community decades later).
The first white Methodist meeting left the district in the 1930 ’ s.
At that time, an African-American meeting took over ownership of the building.
St. Martin's church was taken over by a meeting under the leadership of the great John Howard Johnson, who led a fight against the 125th street vendors (the main trade street in Harlemia), opposed to the employment or promotion of the African Americans.
The fire of 1939 damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson’s paraffins began to rebuild the temple and to repair the building of the bells.
Great David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson, and his successor at St. Martin's church, proudly called the new carylon "the poor".
The expert who called in July described them in a different way: "Cultural treasure" and "unreplaced historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noticed that it is the first carilion in the world served by black music. This artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the Church of Riverside Church, where he was waiting for a larger team.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Martin's church didn't replace him.
During the last months of St. Marcina’s church, a number of complicated events involving architects and performers took place. Part of them were brought to the site by the clergy, and part was the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the paraphilanthropist (the paraphilanthropist’s body composed of the leaders of the world) directed its concerns to the decection, claiming that “it wants to pass the costs on to the council”, although the council did not participate in the employment of the architects and the performers sent to the scene.
Part of the paraffin also complains of lack of transparency on the side of the decade.
Rekin injured 13-year-old diving in search of lobsters in California
The authorities found that last Saturday, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California. It happened on the first day of the season on the lobsters.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he would dive with his friends for about half an hour when he heard a call for help. Immediately with a group of friends flowed to the boy to help him get out of the water.
As Hammel said, it seemed to him at first that the boy was excited by the capture of the homer, but soon he realized that the child was shouting: “I’m stuck!
I've been bitten!".
After arriving at the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had a completely broken skin around the both sides.
"I started screaming to everyone to escape the water: "There is a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the Children's Hospital of the Children's Council in San Diego. His condition was defined as critical.
The species of shrimp responsible for the attack remains unknown.
At the press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that fish had been observed a few weeks earlier. However, it was recognized that it was not a species of endangered sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim experienced serious upper arm injuries.
In order to carry out the investigation and for the sake of safety, the authorities closed their entry to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca for 48 hours until after Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noticed that the environment is home to over 135 species of sharks, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's network plans to expand activities in the British cosmetic market
The Sainsbury's network throws handcuffs to shops such as Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, introducing cosmetics in their supermarkets that are styled in goods houses, as well as specially trained sellers.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetic market, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is constantly developing despite the declines in the fashion industry and household goods, there will be more rules on cosmetic products in 11 stores. If the initiative is successful next year, the action will be extended to other points.
The return to the cosmetic industry results from the search for ways of managing the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's network doubles the number of cosmetic products and will offer even 3,000 items. In the assortment for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw will appear.
Currently sold L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands also get more places and separate areas close to those famous even from Boots shops.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its product offer to make Boutique. From now on, most items will be friendly to vegan, which is increasingly needed by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, in the southern part of London, and the second creation in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, in a later period of the year.
The frequency of online and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local stores makes supermarkets have to encourage more visitors.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said that sales points would be more and more reminded of freight homes, because the network is trying to fight dystony, such as Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos network points in hundreds of shops and has introduced a number of Habitat network points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increasing sales of food items and increasing investment profitability.
The previous attempt to reorganize parts with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals ended with failure.
At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots. However, cooperation was concluded as a result of a conflict of revenue sharing from patents operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduces a new strategy following the sale of 281 patents by Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to Lloyds, it will contribute to the implementation of the plan by introducing an extended offer of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four network stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's commercials, said: "We have reviewed the appearance and nature of cosmetics in order to improve customer impressions.
We have invested in special training for collaborators to help consumers during purchases.
Our brands are able to satisfy all needs, and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to pay attention to customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the way in which purchases are made."
Peter Jones "excited" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a contract worth 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Dan's TV program, was "suffering" when he found out that Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from the value of 11 million pounds of lifestyle brand to focus on the new collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household items called Truly.
The activity was compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, 37-year-old presenter announced her departure through Instagram service.
The sudden decision to leave a well-professed lifestyle brand and focus on the newly associated collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV taken by Holly Willoughby inspired Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den.
According to sources, Peter Jones was "suffering" when a popular television showr announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds, there would be no time to dedicate their March offering the accessories and articles of the Truly household.
The company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand. She also had to double Holly Willoughby's property estimated at 11 million pounds.
After announcing the decision to leave Truly's brand by the 37-year-old Holly Willoughby at Instagram Peter Jones, he left the United Kingdom, returning to one of his summer homes.
Says the source: “Truly’s brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She tied her future with her and wanted to take care of her for decades to come.
The decision to withdraw completely surprised all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday.
In Marlow's warehouse, goods are ready for sale."
The experts believe that the resignation of this Morning and one of the biggest success stars in the UK can cost the company millions of pounds in view of significant investments in products – including items from candles to clothing and household goods – as well as further delays in market entry.
It can also mean the end of a long - term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin for ten years maintained close relations with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp set up a True brand in 2016 and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March at the presidency.
The couple were on leave together, and Jones had 40% of the participation in the television production of Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is to become an M&S ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the I'm A Celebrity program at the ITV station.
A source near Peter Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business".
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
The president joked at the criticism of the media, which some considered to be "disobedient to the husband", as well as a positive relationship with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump surrender so much?
Trump said in a loud voice, giving a TV presentation:
"I didn't give up anything."
The president pointed out that Kim Dzong Un was interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was called by Trump a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations are lagging behind.
After more than three months since the June summit in Singapore, the chief of North Korean diplomacy Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a "analogous response" from the United States to the early North Korea actions aimed at disarmament.
He noted that instead, the United States maintains sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We planned a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we're maintaining a great relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Dzong Un have had a positive effect: they have led to the completion of the missile tests, helped free hostages and return to the rest of the American soldiers at home.
He also defended his unusual approach in talking about the relationship with Kim Dzong Un.
"It's easy to behave according to the presidency. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium, we would have 200 people here," Trump said, showing the crowd's thumb gathered directly in front of us.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia accidentally destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Despite the loss of a roof over the head by more than 10% of the population of Lombok, the authorities did not announce a food disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"In many cases the authorities have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so the situation is difficult," said Selina Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, there is no doubt that international staff will be able to operate on site.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Agency for Natural Disasters, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Pala to see if aid from international organisations should be allowed.
In the face of constant shocks in Indonesia, the country remains totally unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although in the province of Aceh there were shelters for tsunamis, they are rare in the case of the rest of the shoreline.
A lack of oxygen warning against tsunamis in Paul – despite warning – is likely to have an impact on the number of deaths.
Even under the most favourable conditions, travelling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
The body parts are even more difficult to find.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on Lombok Island, travels with the help of victims of earthquakes to the city of Palu. However, to reach the goal it will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesia's infrastructure at the main point of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds on the roads and railway lines.
However, in the face of future elections, the President's administration is struggling with a lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo was placed under pressure in the country of tension on a religious basis. Members of the majority of the Muslim community accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people have died, and tens of thousands of people have lost their heads as a result of the struggle between Christian and Muslim gangs with the use of swords, bows, arrows, and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge gets a break in the Chelsea game
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from the Battle of Chelsea in the English Premier League, winning the gate in the 89th minute of the Saturday match played at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London.
Sturridge received treatment from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea gate at 1:0 for the disadvantage of his team.
Before shooting at a remote gate, he put the ball on his left foot.
The ball speeded high above the criminal field towards the top right corner of the net.
Then she stepped into the gate and flew over the throwing Kep Arrizabalag.
"I just tried to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri always try to take it forward as the most. I wanted to give myself the best shot," Sturridge said in an interview for LiverpoolFC.com service.
"I noticed the approaching Kante, I took the ball, and I gave the shot without any deeper thought."
Chelsea led 1:0 in half of the match after the Belgian star Eden Hazard shot in 25 minutes.
The Celestial Attacker dug the ball five to Mateo Kovačica and then ran towards Liverpool half.

The number of Tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832 people
As the Indonesian food disaster agency reported on Sunday morning, the number of victims of recent earthquakes and tsunamis in the country increased to 832.
During the conference, the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho informed that as a result of a Friday earthquake of 7.5 degrees in the Richter scale, many people were imprisoned under the roofs.
Located by more than 380 thousand people in the city of Palu, it is full of thick blocks of fenced buildings.

Cromwell's memory before the British Parliament's last victim in the dispute of "writing history again"
The removal of the memory would bring justice to the Taliban's warning of the destruction of many English cultural and religious remains by its radical, Puritan supporters.
However, Cromwell Society's association described Jeremy Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and a "try to write history again".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society Association, said: “In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments, the issue of the status of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
In the course of the English domestic wars, the imagery was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps his predecessor Thomas was determined to punish not Cromwell for his actions.
The way in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell in the memory is a testimony to the joy of this policy in the 19th century and that for many people it is a figure that is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: “By many people Cromwell was seen – perhaps more often in the 19th century than at present – as a defender of parliament against external pressure, of course, the monarchy.
The assessment of the appropriateness of this statement is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as a guardian Lord also deserve to be taught and remembered."
In China, there has been a fatal disturbance of the farmer through the pig
According to local media, the trade in south-west China has led to a fatal attack of pigs on the farmer.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and with a broken artery near the mall in the town of Liupanshi, in the province of Kujču.
The pig breeder is preparing for vaccination in Chlewni, 30 May 2005, Xining, in the province of Qinghai, China.
According to reports, the man came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the priest found the man’s body and noticed the door open to the nearby nail.
He said there was a big request for blood in the bowl.
The body section confirmed that it was about 250 kilograms of pigs that had been fatally disturbed by the farmer.
"The feet of my cousin were bleeding and reincarnated," said a man named Wu quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The materials from the surveillance camera show that Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The trade manager said in a report to the Guiyang Evening News service that at the time of the police's collection of evidence, the request was withdrawn to avoid another attack.
According to the report, the male family and the trade authorities negotiate compensation for death.
There have already been cases of attacks by pigs on humans, although they are rare.
In 2016 the pig attacked the woman and her husband at the farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, about 300-kilogram pigs enslaved the farmer to the tractor. The man's wife managed to pull the animal away.
After eating a farmer from Oregon through pigs in 2012 one of the farmers in Manitoba said CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can lead to brutal behavior.
“They just want to have fun.
They're so interested in nothing... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
Residues after Hurricane Rosa cause heavy rainfalls in the south-west part of the United States
According to the predictions of the Rosa hurricane, it loses its power, moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days it will cause intense rainfall in northern Mexico and south-west parts of the United States.
Hurragan Rosa knows at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 east time he was given category 1. He was then located 620 km south west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to the forecast on Sunday, Rosa will move north.
In the meantime, above the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form rather than heading east toward the western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula as a tropical storm, moving the masses of wet air north, to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, he will bring downs of up to 25 cm in parts of the territory of Mexico.
In the next few days, wet tropical air in contact with the approaching below causes rainfalls in the Southwest of the United States.
In some places, precipitations ranging from 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden flooding, pollution movement and possible removals in desert areas.
Wild tropical air causes falls anywhere from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour. This is particularly true in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in some regions of the South-West USA, especially above much of Arizona.
In view of the widespread nature of tropical precipitation, sudden floods and violent changes in conditions may be possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is decided to take a walk around the desert.
The bays can turn canyons into flowing rivers, and storms with piorunas cause local winds and dust shifts.
Coming as soon as he gets the local rainfalls on the southern coast of California.
It is possible that rains of a total height of more than 1,3 cm may cause small movements of pollutants and road hazards.
It would be the first drop of this rainy season in the region.
The rainy tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and Tuesday the fall will occur on a larger number of areas.
On Tuesday, rain will reach the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States and will take place in the middle.
In October, together with cooling in the Arctic region throughout the United States, temperature fluctuations may occur. However, in the inter-verse area there will be more heat.
It can lead to violent temperature changes in small distances.
A good example is the weekly temperature differences in the central part of the States.
Between Kansas City (stan Missouri) and Omaha (stan Nebraska) and between St. Louis (stan Missouri) and Des Moines (stan Iowa) these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, annual temperatures may increase again.
In much of the central and eastern parts of the United States, temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to the northern part of the East.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach 27 degrees Celsius, about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecasts indicate a high probability of rising temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Bretta Kavanaugh's hearings
More than 20 million people watched in six television stations triggering Thursday's hearing of the judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, the commentators had to interrupt regular programmes to inform of the sudden return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the senate court committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had locked her in a state of neutrality and tried to take off her clothes during a high-school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that there was no such situation.
It is possible that the Friday number of televisions was even greater than that given by Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company accounted for the average number of TV stations CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, no figures were available yet.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty in measuring the visibility of people at work.
The given number is close to the visibility of U.S. football games or the award of the American Film Academy.
According to Nielsen Station Fox News Channel, whose presentations firmly supported the Kavanaugh nomination, she had the highest visibility. She made an average of 5.69 million views during the day's hearing.
The second location is ABC station of 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million views, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake became a key character for Friday's events.
In the early hours, he was arrested by the CNN and CBS cameras after the office of this moderate republican declared that he had decided to support the nomination of Kavanaugh. He screamed at demonstrators who made it difficult for him to get in the way of hearing the judicial commission.
Flake with his head down for a few minutes listened to the unmistakable opinions. The whole event was transmitted by the CNN station.
“I stand here before you and I ask.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
You have the power in the face of so many women" – he heard from the demonstrative woman.
Before closing the door, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak at the hearing of the committee.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast events expected to vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh before the whole Senate.
Flake said that he would nominate only when he knew that the FBI was investigating the charges in the coming week, which the minority of the Democrats were charged with.
Flake's been convinced after a part of the conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election was important because the Republic would not have the votes necessary to approve Bretta Kavanaugh's nomination without a survey.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges brought under Bretta Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses criticism of using Brexit for its own benefit
In a weekly briefing, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the European Union of criticizing its abandonment plan to win the future of Britain and undermine the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May attends a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In addition to the statement presented by Theresa May on the title page, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs in her Government Boris Johnson attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union following Brexit, according to which the United Kingdom and the EU would be able to collect taxes on its behalf, calling it "totally undesirable".
Shooting Wayde's Sims: Police arrested Ditheon Simpson suspected of murdering LSU
Police arrested suspect due to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in the colours of the State of Louisiana (LSU).
According to the Baton Rouge police command, a 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested and put in custody on the charge of second-degree murder.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As reported by the CBS-related station WAFB police officers found these eyelids on the site and found traces of Simpson's DNA.
The police informed Simpson that he had confessed to shooting Wayde.

On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report that said death caused a head and neck injury.
The police command expressed appreciation for the search team of the state police in Louisiana, the crime lab of the state police, the South University police and the nearby residents for assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of LSU Sports, thanked local authorities for their "work and desire for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The man's measuring 198 cm grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played in the basket in LSU.
In his last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 collections per match.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach from LSU Will Wade said the team was "stirred" and "stirred" by Wade's death.
"It's one of the things we're always worried about," said Will Wade.
Ash emitted by the volcano of Mexico City
The ash coming out of the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Centre for the Prevention of Natural Disasters decided to bring Mexico's inhabitants closer to the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The Centre has recorded numerous riots and shocks.
Published in social media photos show the front lines of cars covered with a thin layer of ashes in the areas of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Since the earthquake of 7,1 degrees, which was visited by Mexico in September 2017, geophysics have recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano at 72 km south-east of the country's capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has remained active since 1994.
The old Catalan separatist police before the referendum on independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, six persons were arrested as a result of senior demonstrators supporting Catalonia's independence with the preventive police forces. On that day, thousands of people took part in the enemy demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the intense referendum on the Catalan section.
The group of masked separation propellers threw eggs and powder into the police. The dark clouds of dust poured down the streets usually filled with tourists.
It also reached an old age later in the day. To stop the force struggle, the police used a stick.
For a few hours, groups of supporters of independence scandalized "We don't forget, we don't forgive".
As the local press reports, fourteen people received medical help because of the minor injuries reported during the protests.
After a year of the referendum of 1 October, the tension was not weak. Although the authorities in Madrid considered it illegal, there is still reason for celebration for the desired Catalan sessions.
The majority voted in favour of independence, but the frequency was low in view of the large number of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people suffered injuries last year in brutal olds with police trying to prevent voting in polls.
On Friday evening, a group of supporters of the independence of the region decided to prevent demonstrations by supporting policemen.
The demonstration took place in spite of this, but a change in route was forced.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician involved in separatist protests, said that there is no longer any hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we survived one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents cried out with joy that they could vote, but now we're stuck in the point without going out," he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the local elections in December last year, the parties supporting the Catalonia section have difficulty in continuing their activities. Many of the most well-known leaders have decided to leave or expect to be arrested in the process due to the role played in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old telephony engineer supporting the police, said that politicians on both sides of the dispute are calling for conflict.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his wish to start the European Parliament's next year's elections.
"The election of the European Parliament is the best way to defuse the crisis of the democratic values of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after several hits by a car in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 7:30 p.m. in British Time (BST).
Commissioner Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point in the direction of the car, a shot from the chest could also be given.
The Mengi Gate provides Livingstone with a victory over the Rangers 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Mengi for Livingstone brought the winning team
Since this season, playing at the liveston club's extraclass, Rangers have been forced into exile, giving Steven Gerrard a second defeat in his 18 matches at the Ibrox Park club's training station.
The Dolly Mengi gate proved victorious, and Gary Holt's team moved to the second place in a table with Hibernate.
The team under Gerrard will remain in this season without winning the trip to the Premiership. On Sunday, the team will meet with the leader of Hearts, to which he loses eight points.
Earlier, because on Thursday, Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA European League.
Livingston is extending a series of victories in his division to six matches. Coach Holt hasn't experienced any failure since his replacement in the last month of Kenny Miller.
Livingston missed several occasions against undisposed opponents
Holta's team should have been involved in driving a lot earlier, as the team's game has contributed to many problems.
First Scott Robinson went through the defense and gave him a shot in the light of the gate, but he couldn't shoot himself naked. Then Alan Lithgow didn't hit the head of Craig Halkett.
The owners allowed Rangsom to play closer to the gate, knowing that they could threaten the rivals during the constant pieces of the game.
And that's the way it's turned out to be a decisive gate.
After the Rangers dropped off the Livingston Free Team, they found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created the situation of Mendze, who got naked in the middle of the criminal field.
At this stage, Rangers had more possessions, but they were unable to force the defences of the economy and did not cause more problems for Liam Kelly.
The schemat was repeated in the second half, and Alfredo Morelos gave one shot at Kelly's door.
Scott Pittman's sample was defended by the Rangers of Allan McGregora, and Lithgov was unable to get into the light of the gate from another permanent fragment destined for Livingstone.
The Rangers continued their attacks in the Livingstone field, but they could not take advantage of the situation. Two sentences were claimed after Halket's intervention against the Glenn Middleton switch and one hand-playing. However, in both cases, the claims of the winners were rejected.
"The Phenomenal" presentation of Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingstone.
In his view, they played a great game, again and again, going beyond expectations.
Their style and composition almost did not change from returning to extraclass. However, Holta should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
This game had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a well-organized defense. Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very careful throughout the match.
There is no way to fight.
Although they have great moments under Gerrard's leadership, they have failed to meet their standards.
There seemed to be something missing in their game: it only happened once through the defense of the host. This should be a serious warning to the Rangers who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
During Saturday's breakfast in Berlin (29 September) Turkish and German leaders accompanied smiles and beautiful weather.
It was the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany to improve relations with NATO.
There have been differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After meeting Erdogan, he went to the Colony, where he opened a new, huge match.
In this city, the largest number of Turks live outside their homeland.
According to the police, for security reasons, a 25-year-old crowd gathered in front of the temple was blocked. However, the president's supporters gathered around to see their leader.
The hundreds of opponents of Erdogan – including many Kurds – also decided to express their opinion by condoning the Turkish leader's policy and the German government's decision to adopt the country's policy.
On the contrary, the protests reflect the divisions which sparked the visit of the politician called by a part of the Turks living in Germany and recognized by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: the biker died as a result of a car crash
Rowerista died after a car crash in London.
The incident occurred near the busy intersection of the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, the south-east of the city, about 10:15 p.m. (BST).
After the accident, the driver stopped the vehicle and the rescuers arrived. Despite the intervention, the man died at the scene.
A few months ago, another fatal accident involving a bicycle took place on Childers Street (approximately half a mile from the site on Saturday).
Metro police have led officials to work on identifying a dead man and informing of the occurrence of family members.
The roads were closed and bus routes were organised and drivers were advised to avoid the area nearby.
Long Lartin's crime facility: six officers have suffered injuries as a result of embezzlement
According to the local authorities, six officials have reported injuries as a result of a crime in a prison facility for men with an elevated level of safety.
The HMP Long Lartin crime facility in Worcestershire began around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and continues.
A special unit called "Tornado" was called for during a riot involving eight prisoners in one of the premises.
Officials on the spot have reported minor facial injuries.
The director of the firm said: “In action at the HMP Long Lartin prison, specially trained personnel were involved.
Six officers have suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our institutions, and we are confident that those responsible will be transferred to the police and can spend more time in prison."
In the HMP Long Lartin prison facility, more than 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to the report in June, the director of the company had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, prevention units were called to the plant because of the dangerous environments in which workers were attacked by ballpoints in the balance.
Sudden floods caused by the Rosa hurricane threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial effects on dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression will reach Arizona. It will probably come at the beginning of next week. The rest after the hurricane of Rosa move through the desert areas of the South West, threatening with sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of the possibility of sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, south and east Nevada, southern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to a forecast Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon rainfalls will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported via Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the storm or tropical depression at 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurragan Katrina (in 1967) approached a distance of 65 km from Arizona state border."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict discounts from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach a height of up to 15 cm.
In the other desert areas of the South West, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Cotline, the rainfall is likely to rise from 2.5 to 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
In addition to areas threatened by sudden rainfall, people with Hurricane Rosa may be relieved, as the region has been struggling with droughts for some time.
Although the flood poses a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where the drought is taking place.
As the weather.com portal reports, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that almost 40% of Arizona's area competes with the affected droughts of the second highest category.
Hurragan Rosa comes first to the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with hurricane force, reaching speeds up to 137 km/h. Currently it is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north at 19 km/h.
Hurragan is pumping colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing its weakening.
According to the forecast, a tropical storm will strike in Mexico in the afternoon or in the evening.
Intensive rainfalls in some parts of Mexico may pose a major flood threat.
The weather.com portal stated that "in the area from the California Peninsula to the north-western part of Sonora state, falls from 7 to 15 cm are expected, although they can reach 25 cm".
Then the hurricane of Rosa will pass through Mexico north in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early hours of the morning, it reaches the Arizona state border as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening it will reach the southern part of Utah state.
“The most serious threat posed by the Rosa hurricane or its remains is the very low rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the north-west part of the state of Sonora and in the south-west desert areas of the United States,” states National Hurricane Center.
According to the forecast, the rains pose a threat to the life of sudden flooding and the movement of pollution in the desert and mud in the mountainous region.
An attack in Midsomer Norton: four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on the charge of attempted murder of a 16-year-old found in the county of Somerset.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton on Saturday, about 4:00 p.m. British time (BST).
The victim was transferred to the hospital, and her condition remains "stable".
As the Avon and Somerset police report, one seventeen-year-old, two-eight-year-old, and a 20-year-old, were arrested at night around Radstock.

Trump said Brett Kavanaugh "discovered the rage and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote given to Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the irrefutable and depressing proceedings of the Democratic Party," Trump said for a time in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "saw anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention, and he emotionally and emotionally opposed Christine Blasey Ford. A woman claims that several decades ago, when they were both teenagers, the man allowed herself sexual assault.
Ford also testified during the hearing on the charges brought by her.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day "Americans could be convinced of the brightness, class and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of the support of one of the most important lawyers of our time, a scholar of the law of great rights for the community," he said before the crowd of voters for centuries in West Virginia.
The President did not refer at all to the appointment of Bretta Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of the frequency of Republicans in half of the presidential elections.
"From the most important choices in our lives, we are divided into five weeks.
I do not start in these elections, but I remain very active," he said.
"I'm still fighting against our great candidates."
Trump argues that the Democrats are pursuing a policy of "strengthening resistance and hindering activity".
As the CNN station said one of the assistants of the important policy of the Republican Party, the first key Senate vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia. Number of victims increases
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people died – many of which were kidnapped by high waves breaking down on the beach – following a strong earthquake on the land and tsunamis that visited the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in Pala, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to participate in the festival town. On the way to the beach they hit waves of up to 6 meters high, swallowing many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunamis were the result of an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the threat came yesterday, people living on the beach did not run away immediately and fell victim to tsunamis," said at a conference in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Indonesian agency for the disaster of BNPD.
"Tsunami attacked everything on its way, driving cars, colds and homes," Nugroho added. He added that before reaching the shoreline, the food moved to the sea at 800 km/h.
As he said, some of them were saving their lives by climbing to the tree and they were able to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Pala.
Many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and damaged bridges and water-rounded swords are seen in the photographs published by the Agency for Natural Disasters.
On Saturday, the coastal city visited the east.
A number of earthquakes have occurred in the area of 2.4 million people.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT), energy released by the widespread fifth earthquake was about two times as much as the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration stated that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long, narrow bay, could be affected by the tsunami.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said that the strike had taken hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels.
He then added that the body part of the victim was found under broken buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 people were considered missing.
Nugroho said that the deaths and injuries could be greater along the coast line 300 km north of Pal, in the area called Dongala, which was close to the Earthquake Epicenter.
According to Nugro, the communication "has been totally paralysed", therefore there is no report from the province of Dongal.
“The town is over 300 thousand people” – you can read in the Red Cross statement. It has also been added that workers and volunteer organisations appear in affected areas.
"Now we can talk about tragedy, although the situation may lead to a significant deterioration," said the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with a general criticism of the lack of information on the impact of the tsunamis in Paul. However, the authorities indicated that the waves had come just after the warning was given.
On the amateur video released in social media, you can see a man screaming from the building, trying to warn of the coming tsunamis of people on the street.
Within a few minutes, the water wall broke down on the shore, destroying buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency was unable to confirm the authenticity of the recording immediately.
Earthquake and tsunamis have caused a significant lack of electricity supply, preventing communication within the framework of the Pale. This has, in turn, made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
According to the authorities, the military began to send transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic items of the first need.
The airport located in the city was opened only for transport with humanitarian aid. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo will visit the centres for people evacuated to Pal.
Over 800 victims of tsunamis in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
According to Doseb T. Sinay, the National Director of World Vision, the staff of this organization arrived safely from the province of Dongal to the city of Palu and found refuge in the homes of the homeless in the area of the office.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some of the groups slowly began to give up aid, the criticisms emerged that the travel to Paul of workers from foreign humanitarian organizations with a rich experience would not be possible.
According to Indonesian law, the acceptance of funding, resources and personnel from abroad can only begin after the disaster has been announced by the national disaster area.
It's not done for now.
"We are officially still dealing with a regional disaster," said the Indonesian spokesperson for the Red Cross.
"When the government believes that a national disaster has occurred, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but this has not yet happened."
After two days of the fifth earthquake of the earth and the tsunamis in Paul, friends and families of those who have been lost still hope that their loved ones will find themselves in the midst of destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman who spent two days under the thicks next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian paralytic representation, trained two missing paralytics participating in this month's Asian games in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandadi said, other people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As an experienced paralytic, I am struggling with my own emotional load," he said.
Gendon Subandano told us that within a few hours of the arrival of the community, the co-pilots of information about Roa Roa desperacko's collapse sent messages through the WhatsApp communicator to athletes participating in the beach festival.
His messages were marked only by one grey hook instead of a pair of blue hooks.
"It seems to me that this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole 26 750 USD while filling cash in the ATM in the center of Newport on the Levee
According to the Newport police command, on Friday morning, the thief stole 26,750 USD to the staff of Brink, who filled cash in the ATM at the Newport on the Levee shopping center.
"The car driver emptied the ATM into a fun complex and prepared to supplement the cash," said Detective Dennis McCarthy in a published communication.
Another man "run from the back to Brink's employee" and stole a wallet with money for the ATM.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not show how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information on identity of the thief are requested to contact the police in Newport under number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Raper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
Advertised his intention in Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself: "A person known earlier as Kanye West".
Forty-one-year-old music has been using the pseudonym Ye ever since. It's also the title of his eight album released in June.
The change took place before a visit to Saturday Night Live. It is expected that during the performance the artist will present his new album pt. Yandhi.
He will replace the songwriter Ariana Grande, who, according to the authors, has given up on "emotional reasons".
The West has already stated that the word "Ye" is not only short of his present artistic insight, but it has religious significance.
“I think that “yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Scriptures it means “You””” – said West in a previous period of the year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter about the pseudonyms of Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – reflecting all of our good, evil and evil traits.
The album shows who we are."
West found himself in the edge of other famous rappers who decided to change their names.
Sean Combs, known under the pseudonyms of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former co-worker West, also wrote his pseudonym in various ways, with the connector, without the connector and large letters.
President Elect of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador undertakes not to use military against civilians
On Wednesday, the 50th anniversary of the demonstration of student protests by the president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) has committed never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday at the square of the Three Cultures López Obrador promised "never to use troops to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire in the square towards a peaceful demonstration, killing even 300 people. It happened at a time when left-wing movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young people living in Mexico by providing monthly financial assistance for students, as well as by creating more free public schools.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities for young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence research
As Kai-Fu Lee says, an investor and artificial intelligence expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple groups, along with the increase in China’s activity in this area, should double research expenditure in the field of SI.
It is noted that there is no official SI strategy in the United States, despite the fact that the US does not have an artificial intelligence announcement published by the various US government agencies.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan, according to which by 2030 they wanted to become the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence.
"At first, we must double the budget for research on SI: all other countries are far away from the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area," Kai-Fu Lee said.
In his report this week, CNBC also said that double funding could double the chance of another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, president of Synovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most important companies in the art intelligence industry in China, known as Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University over the creation of the SI system, which won the best American player in the game Othello. He then took the lead in Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognized the success of previous American government's technological initiatives, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency in the Defence Area (DARPA) competition for the most interesting work projects. He also asked about the deadline for the next edition of the matches, as he thought it would help find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to make a lot of effort to receive government grants.
"It's not China that we get the best representatives of academic environments, but corporations," Lee said.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed excellent scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of SI.
"I think that people with artificial intelligence who have achieved a doctor's degree should automatically grant a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council published a plan to create artificial intelligence for the next generation.
According to Lee, the Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science (National Natural Science Foundation of China) provides funding to members of academic institutions close to the American National Foundation for Science and other governmental organizations that recognise American resources. However, the quality of academic activities in China is lower.
In the early part of this year, the United States Department of Defence called the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will engage in the work of partners from the world of industry and science. The White House announced the creation of a special commission of artificial intelligence (Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
This month, the DARPA agency also informed about the allocation of $2 billion for the initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than USD 100 billion per year in SI research.
At the same time, the American initiative aimed at creating the National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence from the month ahead did not take a step forward.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in the referendum on the change in the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow the movement to welcome a ten-year dispute with Greece, which blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in the area where the historic region of Macedonia is situated, maintains that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, thus calling for the country's accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the name of the country. However, nationalists claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of the Macedonian population.
President Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The campaign encouraging the boycott raised doubts as to whether the frequency would reach the minimum level of 50% required to recognise the referendum as binding.
The referendum asks: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU after the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
Candidates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth paying the price for the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I have voted for the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will provide us with greater security," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that it respects the results of the vote.
The change of name requires the support of two thirds of Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission has informed that no unusual events have been recorded by 13 p.m.
However, the frequency of this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections since 2016. At that time, 66% of the people were elected.
"I voted in favour of my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Tanewski, the Skopje electorate.
On 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of the country Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duszko voted in a referendum on the change of name of the country to open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union.
Prior to the building of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small stage and set the chairs against the rents distributed by the boycotting referendum.
"We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with the head-on, not the back door," Kawardarkow said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of European integration."
Prime Minister Zaew says that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, with unemployment rates of more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will change the name of the referendum, because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that voting on "yes" is "the confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Public Studies from 30 to 43% of voters declared their desire to participate in the referendum, which is less than the required frequency.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV Telma TV in Sunday's referendum, 57% of respondents are planning to vote.
70% of respondents found that they had changed their name.
In order for the vote to be successful, the frequency must be 50% + 1 vote.
The failure in the referendum would be the first serious step in the policy of the Western government since the government was held in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City conquers the entire defense of Brighton and wins the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton's defense to the house at the weekend meeting ended with 2:0 for Manchester City. The match was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The gate acquired by Aguera in 65 minutes seemed to be childishly easy.
The action began from being given in the middle of the battle to the Argentine attacker.
The footballer raced three Briggton's defenders.
Then Aguero was among the four Briggton champions.
First he beat one of them and then raced the others and found himself in the back of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he played the ball to the left where he was waiting for Sterling.
The English assailant gave the ball back to Aguery in the criminal field, who beat Brighton Mathew Ryan's butcher, shot at the right side of the gate.
"Aguero fights with the foot watch," the Manchester City Pep Guardian told reporters.
"We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky he got the gate at the time."
However, Sterling provided a blue first run single at the Premier League.
The gate she's talking about fell in 29 minutes.
In the action of this Aguero, he got a ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a great gift along the left side of the box to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move to a distant column.
The Manchester City attacker was sending the ball to the net just before she got off the car.
Manchester City meets with Hoffenheim at the UEFA Masters League on Tuesday at 12:55. The meeting will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to describe the chances of winning Rockies
After losing the chance to participate in the play-off phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer he didn't have to take the first stage.
However, the fans of the Scherzer rivalry hope to meet in Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if only Rockies keep the chance for a play-off show. Currently the team has one win more than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
Rockies can at least count on a wild card if they win a Friday meeting against the Nationals result 5:2. However, they still want to get their first title of the division master.
"Although we play "or nothing", at least we will go out to the battle, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the appearance of opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why would I not want to take part in this meeting."
Nationals have not yet announced the start-up speaker for Sunday's meeting. However, the team agrees with Scherzer's presentation in the first composition.
It would be the thirty-fourth show of Scherzer in the first class. The racer took part in the Thursday shooting training and hopes to take place on Sunday.
The team's true miner from Washington recorded the results 18-7 and ERA 2.53. 300 times eliminated the balls and counted 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
More Trump in West Virginia
Trump did not refer to his appointment as Judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of the Republicans' frequency in half of the presidential elections.
"In November we are putting all the achievements to the fore.
From one of the most important choices in our lives, we've been divided for five weeks.
Although I don't start, I remain very active.
He went on to say: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions in our own eyes.
They're determined to take power by all possible means, they're dirty and they're mean.
They do not care for those who are injured and have to harm them in order to gain power and control; and the extent of power and control is to their own detriment; and We will not give them this up.
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission of "putting up resistance and hindering activity".
"It has been very good to see this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bad, evil, unpleasant and unreal".
The president referred to the Senate Judicial Commission, calling on the name and name of the American Senator of the Democratic Party of Diana Feinstein, which met with a loud applause from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leaking of the document?
"Uh, do I hear?
It was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant to those expressing its own opinion
When Momentum's operatives in my party voted for my badge, I wasn't surprised.
Finally, I am a member of the Group of Ambassadors of the Labour Party, which was recently told that they are not welcome, and all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with similar treatment because she was opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the application for a bribe was based on the differences between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. As ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
In a Friday announcement on the meeting of the Labour Party parliamentarians from Nottingham East, it was possible to read: "We want the meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years, the post office of the Labour Party for me was exactly what most of the afternoon Friday meetings of the General Committee looked like.
Unfortunately, many meetings are currently taking place differently, and the promises of a "more hearty and gentler" policy have long been forgotten as long as they have been remembered.
It is increasingly evident that the Party of Labour does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is assessed in terms of compliance with the party's management.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn took the chair's position. The colleagues, where I thought we had similar views, began expecting me to change my direction and take up the positions I would not have agreed with before, were concerned with issues such as national security or the single EU market.
After every public event, no matter what the content, I meet in the social media with attacks calling for the reception of nominations, the contamination of the centre or the abandonment of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the comments under my address are more political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to the daily agenda with the insults of others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should support the culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer grouping people with different views. With every request for "infidelity" and every change in the rules of the party's choice of views, the party is bound to shut down.
Over the last two years, I have been repeatedly suggested that I not go wrong and beg for some questions.
But that's not why I took the policy.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student in the failure of the Margaret Thatcher government, which led to my school break-up, I try to ensure a better quality of public services for those in need – both local councillors and ministers.
I've never kept my convictions, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone around Nottingham East knew my position and knew about differences in opinion with the party authorities.
To those who supported the Friday proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the President of the Laborists approaching Brexit, which would harm the domestic economy, businesses and public services.
However, the most important transmission I am sending not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electors (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud that I can serve you. I promise that no threat of cancellation of the nomination or clear political goals will discourage me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17 – unrestrained Ayr again up
Two late applications could have somehow exhausted the final result, but there is no doubt that Air team won this extremely interesting match of shock extraligi.
The team was in the first place in the table and remains the only unresolved team.
Finally, this distinctive defence and better use of the opportunity led the host team to win. Coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied with his subjects.
"The swords of the past have been a challenge for us, but we are still imperfect, so I am pleased," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team said: "It is necessary to respect Air fighters. They have better used the opportunities that appear."
Ayr went to drive in 14 minutes after Grant Anderson's application and raised Frazier Clim. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes's shoe, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to balance the result when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an unused chance to raise.
Climo increased Air's driving after the execution of the penalty cast just before the end of the first half. At first he got an application, and then took advantage of the chance to increase, getting the result 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose had a good start in the second half. Patrick Anderson's application, raised by Baggot, reduced the loss to five points.
The game was then further stopped because of the serious contusion of Ruaridh Knott. The racer was removed from the battle on his nose. After resumption, Ayr increased the driving after the application of Stafford McDowall and the rise of Clima.
In the next round, the captain of the Air Blair Macpherson team received a yellow card. Melrose again used its number: applying with an unused attempt to increase Bruce Colvin reduced driving.
The owners took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for the release of the Clim without a ball. MacPherson got an application on the back of the approaching defense.
Climo took the chance to increase, and then again he managed to increase the result just after he resumed the game, when Kyle Rowe caught a shot from the prison shoot and enabled Gregor Henry to win the fifth application for the host.
Still Game series star starts a career in the gastronomic industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems to be starting business in the gastronomic industry. Recently it was discovered that he was the director of the company leading the restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is playing Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC station site. Hemphil is a concert together with his multi-year comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
Duet announced that the coming nine season will be the last in the series history. Everything points out that Ford Kiernan is planning the future after the abandonment of Craiglang.
According to the official data, he became Director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the subject, although the Scottish Sun informant suggested that Kiernan is trying to engage in the "growing gastronomic industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": the lost access to the Bolivian sea is a living hope that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the base of the military in La Paz.
From public buildings, blue flags are said.
“ The sea is ours under the law, ” says the U.S. Navy port of the Lake Titicaca after the Amazon.
His recovery is our duty."
In the lack of access to the Bolivian sea, the mention of the shoreline lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still alive.
These hopes may be greater than a few decades. Bolivia expects the judgement of the International Court of Justice. It will be issued on 1 October after a five-year trial.
"Bolivia's actions are taking the lead. The residents are unanimous, optimistically set up and count on a positive verdict," said Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will jointly attend the International Court of Justice. They hope that the organization with the headquarters in The Hague recognizes Bolivia's claim and, after decades of free talks, Chile will have to join the negotiations on granting independent State access to the sea.
Evo Morales, charismatic president of Bolivia, who will stand up next year for an emerging debate on the fight against reelection, also gives hope in the Monday's decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific” – he reached the end of August.
Some analysts say, however, that the chances for Bolivia’s benefit are small and that even a favorable decision would not change much.
The United Nations Office at The Hague has no authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. He also observed that it would not affect the establishment of any talks.
As Paz Zárate said, the Chilean expert on international law, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the submission of the final arguments.
Unfortunately, Bolivia has been able to distance the country from its destination for the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea was addressed by the current Bolivian administration," said Paz Zárate.
The unparalleled rhetoric of Morales has freed the Chileans from any remaining good will, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume their talks at some point, but it will be very difficult in the face of the present situation.
In the case of both countries, there has been no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, did not agree with the view that the court's decision-making process was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "end of a 139-year period of disputes with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the subject of access to the sea as an element of political play.
"Bolivia never gives up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is a great opportunity to make sure that we have to cope with the past."
North Korean owners claim that nuclear disarmament will not occur until they can trust the United States.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho says his people will never get rid of nuclear weapons until they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore Summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared at a time when the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be on the verge of re-establishing a nuclear-related diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Unem.
Ri claims that the "mrzenka" is as if there was no abolition of the sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war had ever thrown North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign a declaration without prior approval by Pjongang of specific disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is a widespread skepticism that Pjongangang seriously approaches the elimination of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only security-guarantee.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Parisian fashion shows announce the appearance of the latest big lines to cover heads in clothing shops.
If you want to expand your collection of chapels or hide in front of the sun, we have good information for you.
The fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the run a series of crazy, extra-dimensional heads that were part of their summer 2019 collection, which enchanted style during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
These designers decided to present their stunning creations on the run at Instagram this year.
The distinctive work of Valentino was a giant bee chapel decorated with a wide, pier round that poured the head of the models.
Other additional accessories included beads, magic hats, and even pineapple — however, they were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of special masks — at the same time on Halloween.
Many color masks had long mouths and reminded of more Hannibal Lecter style than haute couture.
One creation reminded the diving equipment with the pipe and the glasses, and the other looked like a dissolved ice.
And if you don't want to break up with a big fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers provide that huge chapels can reach clothing shops.
The unmatched chapels follow the "La Bomba", a broken chapel with a width of 61 cm, which has already been worn by all – from Rihanny to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand behind this unusually unpracticing chapel, which was crossed by social media, presented another great creation — a broken beach bag almost as large as the model wearing it was worn in the bathroom.
The burnt orange bag of the rafia, finished with rafia fried and twisted with a white leather handle, was distinguished in the collection of Jacquemus La Riviera for the summer 2019 season during the fashion week Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a star designer, said FEMAIL: “I hope that large chapels and beach bags will appear in shops next year — because the designer has succeeded in making such a big impact, it would be difficult not to use the demand for extra-vital accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills necessary for the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly pleased with their scientific achievements — in 2018 they were able to welcome further significant results of exams, individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other social activities.
Representatives of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) of more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland are seeking to provide the best level of services provided to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, chosen by them in their careers and to show them their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the possibility of developing and implementing a school-adjusted learning programme, we see that innovative languages are still popular and desirable subjects for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another man in the language he understands, then he will get it to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, he'll get to his heart."
It is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages take the lead in league rankings, with the highest levels of remoteness in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign - language students received a higher grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS students showed that 72 per cent of students received higher grades A in Mandarin and 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received grades A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as necessary skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language learning is conducted in the same area as STEM (introduction, technology, engineering and mathematics) in education programmes in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) showed that the lack of language skills was responsible for the difficulty of occupying job vacancies by employers in 17 percent.
As a result, more and more language skills become necessary to prepare young people for the start of their career.
These skills are needed in a globalised world with an increasing number of jobs requiring language skills,
Lifelong learning skills, such as learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future, regardless of the path of professional development.
The possibility of a direct agreement with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of multilingual people in relation to competition.
According to a 2013 YouTube survey involving more than 4,000 adult British people, 75% of them were unable to speak in a foreign language so well to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language whose percentage was double-digit, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investing in foreign language learning is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of the developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding suitable employment.
Every school in Scotland will differ in terms of the languages taught in it.
Many schools focus on more classical innovative languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom in the perspective of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, there will always be many languages in independent schools to choose which will be taught by specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are involved in creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to bring success — regardless of what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that the international business environment still has a key role to play in the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
New languages should be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a great choice, diversity and level.
That's just right.
John Edward, president of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut at the Lakers team Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who wanted to see LeBron James' debut in Los Angeles Lakers finally waited.
Luke Walton, coach of Lakers, announced that LeBron James played a Sunday pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
We don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, but less than 48," Walton said on the official website of the Lakers team.
The reporter of the Lakers team, Mike Trudell, on Twitter announced that James is most likely playing a incomplete number of minutes.
After the training that took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers matches.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to take part in pre-season games to prepare," he said.
The Western Virginia trumpet, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump launches a series of electoral events in West Virginia tonight at Wheeling.
It's the first of five of the polling stations planned by Trump, which will take place next week, along with positions in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Along with the vote confirming that his election to hold a free position in the Supreme Trump Court is seeking to build support in the forthcoming elections in the mid-term, as the Republicans may be in danger of losing control of the Congress when the votes will be cast in November.
What time is it going to take tonight to pick the Trump in West Virginia and where will it be possible to see him online?
So the Trump in Wheeling in West Virginia will take place today at 19.00, i.e. Saturday, 29 September 2018.
So you can choose Trump in West Virginia to be monitored live on the Internet on YouTube.
The Trump will probably refer to this week's hearings of the candidates nominated to the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh, who took place in a tense atmosphere due to proposals for improper sexual behaviour, as well as the proposed vote in the Senate on the suspension of the election for a maximum period of one week, during the investigation by the FBI.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral campaigns is to support Republicans facing difficult November elections.
So President Trump's five-week campaign is aimed at "mobilizing volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives" — Reuters.
"Congress control is such an important point in the President's timetable that, as the hottest season of the campaign approaches, he will visit as the largest number of states," said Trump's spokesman, who did not grant his name – Reuters.
Today's election in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the attention of the Pittsburgh media – West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump visits West Virginia — a state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia candidate to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey, who loses in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician from West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows the spirit of the struggle, keeping hope of victory in Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the forum format that took place on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The growing volume of divorce is a completely invented concept of sports, but the way in which the racers really believe, and now the most in such professions as these.
So what do they look like at the moment?
"They've run six points, and now they're only running four, so I think we've got a little gap," Jordan Speeth said.
Europe, of course, leads four points, while there are twelve more to be achieved.
The Americans, as Spieth says, however, feel the wind in the frogs and have good patterns to imitate, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them could praise himself by obtaining three points out of four.
Speeth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
The screams on the entire throat, the sign of excitement, became increasingly louder during the course of his round, waving the key pit and winning the match when he and Thomas got two holes in two hits.
His plot on the ground, which gave them a victory of the 15th, met with a similar cry — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in play.
"It's enough to focus and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of each of these contestants.
18 bucks to win.
The only players who in the last two days have gained a greater number of points than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable story of Ryder Cup.
Strange, but a lovely couple from the European team won four of them and didn't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't count the godsey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the godsy on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on Friday morning.
The way of the game and how their energy seems to flow both to, and from the hilarious crowd, proves that it is necessary to beat these players on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could mark the potential victory of the European team on Le Golf National.
It would be best if they were playing on different dolls at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the early hero of fourball, when he and Alex Noren were involved.
Boley and the doubles on the front of them dug Spain and Sweden into a hole from which they would never get away.
There's no one on Sunday to help get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between the funds, the advice they make, the advice they do not make, and how the strategy can be changed at one point.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has taken a significant advantage of the last day, but the forum session has also shown that the United States team has an impact on the fight in which some, especially in the States, have doubted.
Europe with a result of 10-6 includes driving on the final day of Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning the 10-6 Saturday fourball matches and foursomes with the United States.
Inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — has given way to two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods, increasing its current Le Golf National score to four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorna, trying to maintain the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an insignificant American team in the early form of fourball, winning a 3-1 series.
The United States has made greater resistance in the form of foursomes, winning two matches, but they cannot undo the loss.
To maintain the trophy, Jim Furyk team has to get eight points out of 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter who won four points in a row, while with Molinarim (the club was called "Mollwood" after a sensational weekend) are just the second couple in Ryder Cup history, which won four points in four opening matches.
After the downfall of Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball format, they defeated the pumped Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau, achieving an even more empathic result of 5&4.
Woods, who got tired of two Saturdays, occasionally showed genius shine, but lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourball and foursome formats, and that's seven out of a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the early fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in foursome format to win 2+1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka — taking positions 1 and 3 respectively in the world ranking.
The European teams, however, did not all come to mind in this pleasant, cold day in the field driven south west of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference point for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Hispanic Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup did the team make a four-point loss, starting with a single, although the Furyka team would only have a resis to keep the throphyum.
However, taking second place two days ago, Sunday contract seems to be rather unlikely.
North Korea says "standby no" to unilateral disarmament without confidence.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday during the UN's talk that the lack of sanctions only deepens the lack of confidence in North Korea in the United States and there is no way that the country will unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the Annual General Meeting that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" last year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and the obligation to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we do not see any specific response from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no mention of unilateral disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's failure to "step" the approach to denuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual action, its statement seemed to be significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation, as in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first in history at the summit between the official president of the United States and the leader of North Korea, who took place on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un committed himself to working for the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", and Trump promised the security guarantees of North Korea.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war (from 1950 to 1953), but the United States representative announced that Pjongang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington also relied on calls to alleviate the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is responsible for "declaration in the first order" and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced way, even contrary to the signature of "war-end declaration," Ri said.
"The fact that sanctions can put us on our knees is a bunch of people who behave ignorantly towards us.
The problem, however, is that the lack of abolition of sanctions deepens our confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, mentioned at the beginning of the week by the United States leader at the UN Forum.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, after which he added: "If the party on the issue of denuclearization was South Korea, not the United States, then there was no such impact on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was completely different compared to the last year, when the UN General Assembly said that the elimination of North Korea missiles in the United States was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim Jong Una a rocket man on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN Trump Forum, which threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea, Kim Jong Una praised for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but also said that there was still a need to put a lot of work on the ground, and also said that until North Korea is released, sanctions will not be abolished.
In the midst of Trump, he said he did not define the time zone, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday at the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be continued and constant until we find full, final and verified denuclearisation".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea, trying to slow down the financing of the nuclear programme and the Pjongang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly Forum and later said he would visit Pjongang again next month as part of preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called success.
He left Pjongang in July, saying that progress was made, after which, within a few hours, North Korea blamed him for "setting up gangster demands".
North Korea committed itself this month to meeting with Moon Jae-in, that it will dismantle the missile testing site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate measures.
He stated that Kim Jong Un told him that "appropriate measures", which he was concerned about, are security guarantees to which Trump had committed himself in Singapore, and to take steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend the course for adequate long rest
The new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided all students with more dreams, aimed at combating the growing culture of macho, which is taught by “all night students driven by caffeine”.
Students from the best university in the world often have no idea of the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of this kind in the United States.
To create a course, he was inspired by his speech about the influence of sleep depression on science.
"After the talk, one girl came to me and said, "Why am I just saying this right now when I'm in my last year of study?"
She said that no one ever told her about the meaning of my dream that surprised me," The Telegraph said.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, students learn how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sports, and improve the overall feeling of students.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Health, said that this course was intended to be introduced after it was found that students suffered severe sleeplessness during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of the peace in the academy where students click on the cupboards to coffee, screens, exercises and books to get information about the influence of caffeine and light and how the lack of sleep affects sports performances, and how it is important to keep sleep regular.
In another section, participants will learn how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this does not lead to an immediate change in student behaviour.
But we believe they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know the health consequences of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride from "all-night science" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students means a growing problem of sleeplessness.
Ensuring a sufficient amount of good quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" of students fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even avoiding weight loss, because lack of sleep causes the brain to pass through the mode of hunger, through which the student is constantly hungry — he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to develop a course after taking part in one of his activities last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press the course for the whole campus.
The next step is to invite all students of postgraduate studies to complete a similar study programme before going to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up a warning alarm when to go to sleep and when to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effect of the "blue light" emitted by electronic devices screens and LED lighting that can break down the daily rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga helps Gerrard team
The Rangers again suffered during the struggle to get out in Livingstone, when Dolly Menga shot his shot to defeat the disassembled Steven Gerrard team, achieving the result of 1-0.
The team from the Ibrox Stadium wanted to record their first victory from the February 4-1 victory over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard in 18 matches, causing for his team a difference of eight points with respect to leader Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga shot naked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' composition showing a lack of involvement didn't seem to improve.
While Rangers scored a sixth drop, Livingstone succeeded in a third — just for Hibernian with a single goal.
The Rangers team may have further problems as a result of the need to take care of Judge Caluma Spence's headline wound after he has been hit by the object thrown out of a guest's court.
Gerrard introduced eight changes in the team, allowing him to advance Air and go to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, went through the same eleven of Livingstone, who took the point of the Hearts team last week, and was fascinated by the way his well-trained team tortured each step of its opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball when they got it.
They should have gained a goal in just two minutes, when the first release of the ball through Menga allowed Scott Pittman to go with the gate of Allan McGregor, but the assistant did not use his chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs addressed a deep-seated shot to Captain Craig Halket, but his colleague Alan Lithgov playing in the defensive position could only remain in the back position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quadrant, but it seemed as if they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he had to be released for fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless fell on himself, but Judge Steven Thomson had developed the Colombian claim.
The Rangers were able to deliver only two customs shots in the first half, but there was a porter Ibrox, Liam Kelly, who was barely worried about Lassany Coulibaly's head and I was weak to shoot Ovie's Ejaria.
While Livingstone's 34-minute goal of opening the match could be counter to the current game, no one can deny that they earned it for the effort they put into it.
The Rangers again failed to deal with the deep, permanent fragment of the game by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw a ball into Scott Robinson, who kept quiet, taking Mengi to a simple end of the action.
Gerrard didn't leave the room and exchange Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, but this change almost immediately had an effect on the wing that threw a ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it, getting it from his position.
The Livingston team continued to bring guests into the game exactly as they liked when Lithgow and Halkett had long given each other.
The Holt team could have increased driving in the last few minutes, but McGregor stood well before Jacobs, after which Lithgov took the game off the trigger.
The Rangers Reserve, Glenn Middleton, had another hope for the execution of the crime when he broke up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes back.
German: Founder of Geiger
And now the page of our Sunday Morning German edition: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day that was born in Germany came the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geiger's counter.
Since then, Geiger has become both a science element and a pop culture, for example in a 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", where you have had little chance of cowboy-scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What is wrong with this?"
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s numerator that is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these hearing aids, you'll hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: "Now hear something!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survived to this day.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the cells' enemies.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify the cells in the course of treatment.
This method is used to separate the immune cells from the patient and change them into the laboratory.
They can then "see" the protein in common for many new ones. They are then injected into the body again.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of tumours.
In one woman treated with a vaccine, an immune system that taught to recognise the enemy cells was observed for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate the immune cells from the patient, to change them into the laboratory so that they can "see" the common protein for many new ones called HER2 and then reinject the patient to these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that this vaccine is very well treated".
HER2 "is trying to grow a few types of tumors", including breast, ovaries, lungs, and fatty glands, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the collection of resistant cells from patients and the “learning” of their localization of tumour cells has been to treat some type of protein.
Kanye West puts on a pro-trump diet in Saturday Night Live — with a MAGA headcap.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was "exploded" at the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after President Donald Trump approved and said he would apply for the board in 2020.
After this night's execution of his third song by Ghost Town, during which he had a titled "Make America Great" hat, he took out against the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
"When I talk to white people, I hear, "How can you like Trump? He's racist!"
If I cared about racism, I'd have been out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL programme started with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star praised Bretta Kavanaugh's testimony to the senate judicial commission on sexual assault charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although he was not broadcast, the video from the West was sent to social media by the comicalist Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock wanted to lick West, putting in a post.
Also, West complained to the public that behind the scenes he had problems with his hat.
"They took me behind the scenes.
They said I wouldn't go out with that hat on my head.
They're all over me!
And then they say I don't have a way out," said Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you say I don't have a way out?" adding, "I'm going to put on a superman's pen, so you won't be able to tell me what to do.
Let's accept it."
His words twice caused a "screaming" of the public, and the members of the SNL team appeared to be troubled — he brings Variety. The person in the study during these events: "In the study there was a grave silence".
The West was invited to the program in place of the songwriter Ariana Grande, who was the boy, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
The West questioned many of the works I Love it in the treatment of water bottles Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: "To one of the most important: JOIN TO MAFIL'S VIEW".
The leader of Karen Hunter's show on Twitter said that the West was just "being himself and it's absolutely great".
"But I'm NOT going to reward people (by buying their music or clothes or by supporting their "arts") who, I think, also accepts the ideologies that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
That's how we're free," she added.
Before the rapper program, he announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that "now formally called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — he follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed the name to a symbol, and then an artist known as Prince.
Crime of attempted murder in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
This happened in Ballyhackamore as the police bring it.
The defendant is to be brought to the courthouse in Belfast on Monday.
The defendants will be investigated by the prosecutor.
Star Games of the throne Kit Harington triggers toxic male issues
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the mid-century HBO series "Game of throne".
The 31-year-old actor hit the hero macho stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen causes young boys to often think they have to play hard to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit found that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the toxic problem of manhood in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married her partner from the throne game plan, 31-year-old actor Rose Leslie, admitted that she felt "a bit confident", moving the issue.
“ Personally, I feel pretty sure at this point — where we made a mistake on the subject of manhood?” he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, looking at the perspective of the problem we are currently dealing with?"
Kit believes that for the development of toxic male, television can be partly responsible because of the presentation of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are born, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets, what makes young boys start to think they have to stand on a particular page to be a man?
I think it is one of the most important issues of our time — what can you do to change it?
It's obvious that everything isn't all right with young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he did not play in any prequel or sequel games of the throne after the series ended next year, saying that he “ended with the fields of battles and horses”.
From November Kit will play in the art "True West" Sam Shepard, which is a story about a film producer and his brother – a thief.
The actor recently found that he considered knowing his wife Rose to be the best thing that happened to him in the Grieve of the throne.
"I met my wife on the plan, which gave me my future family and a new life," he said.
In this award - winning series of Rose’s fantasy series, Emmy played Ygritte — an object of interest in the character of Kita, Jon Snow.
Para took place in June 2018 on the territory of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Chinese account for a 14-percent increase in new cases
The Chinese reported a 14-percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this problem, as health workers in that country bring.
Only around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, which means a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 per year.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT people is widespread.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually get married to women.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient safety while having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has provided universal access to HIV drugs in an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters objected to the fact that one of her team members revealed data to the senators of the Republican Party — "hazardous lies" and "theory of censuses".
A member of the United States Chamber of Representatives, Maxine Waters, dropped charges on Saturday, as if a member of her team had posted personal data from three Republican senators on Wikipedia's side of the legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party has ensured that these allegations have been removed by experts and websites related to the "ultra-corrective wings".
"Truths, lies, and even more uncanny lies," Waters reported on Twitter.
Public information also included home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and it was posted by an unknown person on the Capitol during a panel hearing in the Senate on sexual harassment charges against the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place some time after the Qavanaugh candidacy was challenged by three senators.
Conservatives, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the mail was associated with the Waters office and published information about a member of the Waters team — as Hill says.
"This baseless deposit is totally false and is a hundred percent lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security were violated as a result of these misleading and false accusations — was not in any way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This baseless deposit is totally false and it's a hundred percent lie."
The Waters statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including by Ari Fleischer, a former press spokesman for the White House.
"This kind of rejection is evil," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that she does not have the right temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he can't be angry.
He can't provocate.
He may not question the motives of the accused person.
He has to keep peace for this."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being overly angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"A rough case, if it's true," he wrote on Tweeter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed “the competent authorities and the prosecution authorities of these misleading charges”.
"The rapporteurs will be demised and drawn to legal responsibility for all their actions that pose a threat to any member of my team," she said.
Review by Johnny English: Nokaut — Spice parody with a weakened Red Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in every new film with a British thread has become a norm. It seems to apply in the case of a new part of a series of films from the action and comedy "Johnny English", which started in 2003 from the film "Johnny English" and which returned to the film screens in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will the self-concealing satire about how hopeless we are become a new export commodity in the country?
In any event, forever amazed, with a rubber face, the incompetent Johnny English again received a license to share — his name and name more than anything else signals that he is a built-up, comical design for non-English views.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent, who, despite his strange tastes of smoothie glamour, has a little detail from Inspector Clouseau, Jasia Fasoli's shot and a drop from this guy adding one necessity to the tune of the lead character Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world mystery man — Atkinson once played in the already forgotten Barclaycard television commercials in which he remained in chaos.
In the latest film in the Johnny English series, there is one or two moments worth of attention.
I liked the scene in which Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in the middle of the gun, while his helmet was hit rhythmically by the spindles of the helicopter.
On the screen you can clearly see the gift of Atkinson to play comedy physically, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low and unnecessary, especially that currently also "severe" film brands, such as 007 and Mission Nexus, offer comedy elements as part of the film composition.
The humorous elements seem to be addressed rather to children rather than adults — I think Johnny's crazy adventures are not as creative and consistent as the gagas in his films Atkinson about Jasi Fasoli.
From the current point of view it is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
Cyberhaker moves to the British superintendent network of spies, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field — to the fear of the agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
It's the last drop in a burning premiere, which is a pampered, depressed figure already and suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in her power, aiming at the character of Theresa May, but the script does not give her the opportunity to develop wings.
Her advisors from the intelligence agency inform her that because of the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And this means that Johnny English is unhappy in his own person, currently employed as a teacher in an elegant school, giving an unofficial lesson on how to become a secret agent — a few bad gags during the teaching of spying by English.
English is invited to Whitehall for removal, re-connecting with his former helper Bough, bordered again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a man associated with the commander of the submarine — a cheerful but somewhat tired figure played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin share in the secret service of Her Royal City are returning to action, meeting the beautiful woman of fatal Ophelia Bulletin, the character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of being ruled by a charismatic technological billionaire who claims that he can solve the computer problems of the United Kingdom — he is the periphery of Jason Volt, bordered by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their crucifixion from the absurd situation: dressed as waiters burn the French restaurant; introduce chaos, moving on to the luxury island of Volta; and English falls down when using the set to virtual reality to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's home.
In this last sequence, all restrictions are disappearing, but despite the nice and humorous performance, the whole film is a great reminder of television for children.
A typical medium.
Like other films in the Johnny English series, I couldn't resist thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really correspond to his talent?
The Working Party rejects as if it were drawing up a plan for the British for a four-day work week for which they will receive a five-day salary.
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party will consider introducing a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, receiving a five-day salary.
The party also wants the company's bosses to pass on to the rescue workers the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) giving them an additional day off.
This would allow the employees to enjoy the weekend, obtaining the same amount of remuneration.
The sources suggest that this idea is "entered" into the economic programme of the parties and plans to leave the country against the workers.
The four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
The senior member of the Labour Party in the discussion with The Sunday Times said: "It is expected that a policy change will be announced before the end of this year."
"This will not happen from day to day, but the four-day work week is something that is reflected in the party's approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of the employee, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party committed to introducing a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, these plans are currently not supported by all the members of the Working Party.
The Party's spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not a party's policy and its introduction is not considered by it".
John McDonnell, the Chancellor of the Shadow Office, used the last week's conference of the Labour Party to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless directors" and "speculators" in public utility companies.
The Chancellor's plans from the shadow office also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not regain their full participation, as the government of the Labour Party could make 'debts' on the basis of alleged abuses.
He also confirmed plans for the placement of employees in company boards and the creation of own funds in order to transfer 10 per cent of own funds to private employees who receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond in the program "60 minutes" to the question whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their attitude.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court at least a week and has raised questions as to whether the establishment of the office of inquiry could allow the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, Scott Pelley, conducting a 60-minute program, asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could discover something that could lead to a change in their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened when the drop appeared, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was stable, determined and consistent."
However, Graham's opinion seems to be cut out in stone.
"I made a decision about Bretta Kavanaugh and to change it is a strong commitment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett firmly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people who gave it could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything's gonna change."
What is the event of the Global Citizen Festival, and to what extent has it contributed to the reduction of poverty?
The next Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event of music that can be honored by a very impressive composition of the stars and an equally impressive mission — the elimination of poverty in the world.
The seven Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the realization of the most important objective of this event, which is the liquidation of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group working to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to this event (unless they decided to buy a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world leader, making a phone call or other significant activities to help raise awareness of the purpose of eradicating poverty.
But what success can the Global Citizen enjoy in the 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert a good way to convince them to take action or another case of so-called "clitivism" when people feel that they are doing something important by signing a petition online or by posting on Twitter?
The Global Citizens' Organisation claims that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" in support of the action, seeking to achieve many different objectives.
It also claims that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce their commitments and rules of value over $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group committed 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, in which at least $10 billion was already paid or financed.
The group believes that the security measures have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and realists engaged in "helping children to achieve their full potential", which promised to transfer $35 million to Rwanda for assistance in the eradication of malnutrition in that country, after Global Citizens sent over 4700 tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens, such as you, we can make that social injustice, which is a lack of experience, go back to history" — Tracey Ullman, Ambassador Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the United Kingdom to improve the quality of life of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which reaches up to 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
For one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which was "Why are you sure that extreme poverty will be eradicated?",
The Global Citizen responded: “This will be a long and difficult path — sometimes we will stumble and lose.
But just as in the case of more recent major movements to civil rights and the fight against apartheid, we will be successful because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the stars present during this year's event in New York, whose economies will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a warship to block Russian energy exports — Secretary of Home Affairs
Washington may "if necessary" flee to his military shipyard to prevent Russian energy from flowing into the markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed by the Secretary of Home Affairs of the United States, Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner.
Zinke maintained that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of the government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is the desire to channel energy in trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States has the opportunity to ensure that the maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy is not reached on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that itself defines itself as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is less dependent on the use and substitution of fuels," he said, comparing Russia to a "one-stop shop" with a coal-fired economy.
These statements appeared at a time when Trump's administration continued its mission to increase exports of low-carbon natural gas to Europe, which is much cheaper for European consumers than for Russian gas.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "non-use" Nord Stream 2 gas project, which according to Trump made Berlin a "slave" Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, which is intended to double the existing capacity to 110 billion metres, is a project of an economic nature alone.
Kremlin argues that Washington's jealous opposition to the implementation of this project is solely economical and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said the Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after meeting with the US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States triggered a violent reaction by Germany, which confirmed their commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation Germany, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think this is a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting of Chancellor Angeli Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said he would consider candidates for the president in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that, after the mid-term elections, he would consider running for the president.
At a meeting in Hollywood in Massachusetts Warren, she confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair the corrupt government. It is also the highest position women," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will consider my candidacy as President."
At Warren's meeting, she mentioned President Donald Trumpi, saying he "runs the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren without a garden voiced her criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh.
On Friday on Twitter, Warren wrote: "Of course we need an FBI poll before we vote."
However, published on Thursday, the poll showed that most of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters choosing the option "probably" said that the senator should not run as a result of a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy — 38 percent of the people supported his potential candidacy, and 48 percent of the people opposed it.
Other well-known names from the democratic camp taken into account for the potential candidate in 2020 were Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about the Purasive Stress Team (PTSD) Track Palin during the Donald Trump election age
Track Palin (26 years) spent a year in Iraq after moving to the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, through which he has to go back, I understand other families that feel the effects of PTSD and the wound our soldiers are returning with," said public at the election age Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest "the subject of taboo", after which she said about her son and other war veterans: "They return a little changed, return the trained, return, wonder if respect will be shown for what their fellow soldiers, airlines and all other members of the army have given away to their country."
He was arrested on Monday at Vasilli in Alaska and accused of domestic violence against women, of calling for false testimony in the report on domestic violence and of possession of weapons in a state of improbability, as Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Vasilli Police Department.
18 states and the District of Colombia support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge for the new United States policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and districts in Washington filed a letter of friendship curie on Friday to support the asylum-seeker in that policy — as NBC News reports.
The full name of the reason given by Grace v. Sessions, which American Civil Liberties Union organised in August against federal politics, has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his brutal sons from the gang" were complaining about her, but the American officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
She's been arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors of the states supporting Grace described Salwador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there is a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries struggling with widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy annulled the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Colombia, said in a Friday statement that the new policy "is ignoring the state, federal and international law that has been in force for decades".
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle," as stated in the list of friends of the Curie.
The prosecutors continued to argue in the letter that the policy of refusing entry to immigrants harms the US economy, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and "make the necessary workforce".
In June, the Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Assil is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or belonging to a particular social group or having such other political convictions," the Sessions said in their statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
Asylum never intended to solve all the problems — even those serious — that people from all over the world struggle with every day.
Desperate rescue trials in the Pala, when the number of victims has doubled in a race aimed at finding survivors
For the survivors, it became increasingly tragic.
"It is a very intense feeling," said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, comforting her burned-out son at the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance imports the body.
There's no clean water."
Residents were seen returning to ruined homes, searching for watered things, and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospital, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees, was quickly filled.
Some of the wounded, including Two Haris, who experienced fractures in the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Pal, where patients were treated outside due to severe secondary shocks.
The walls filled his eyes, as he spoke of a violent earthquake on the ground, which shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I think I was pushed into the Romanian wall" — Harris said Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for marriage.
"I heard my wife cry for help after which her voice was silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
Ambassador of the United States accuses China of "suffering" advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-sided ad in the American newspaper praising the mutual benefits of US-Chinese trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China’s Daily Supplement to Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of trying to interfere with the United States Congress, which will take place on November 6th — China rejects this charge.
Zarzut Trump about Pekin's trying to get to the U.S. election, confirmed what US officials told the Reuters agency that this is a new step in escalating a campaign by Washington aimed at producing pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently escalating a trade war that has led to a rise in tariffs for mutual imports.
Chinese tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to touch exporters in such states as Iowa, who supported the Republic of Trump — Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China, and former Yugoslav governor of state — the main exporter of agricultural products to China — said that Beijing had caused injury to US workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in a Sunday article in the Des Moines Register that China "now with double force begins to frown, placing propaganda advertising in our own free press".
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American marked tradition of freedom of speech and free press, placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
For this, there will be no opposition votes on the street in Beijing and no true reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese may have on China's unfavourable economic direction, given that the media is under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most well-known Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans express themselves against the mid-term elections of women with the right to vote by the Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and weapons appointed to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, the analyst warns that your members are meeting in the coming mid-term elections with a violent reaction, especially on the part of women.
The emotions associated with this event are extremely great, and most Republicans are already officially willing to vote.
"This cannot be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts as to whether Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona's) efforts to conduct a recent investigation by the FBI were sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it this morning and they will not forget it until November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the MoveOn group – as a newspaper published in Washington.
On Friday morning, the protesting scandals came to light, demonstrating in the House of the Senate because of the decision of the Republicans controlling the Judicial Commission not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as Mic said.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation goes beyond the scale," said one of the information pages of Stu Rothenberg, a wireless political analyst.
“People say that he was already high — and that’s true.
But it may be higher, especially among undecided women of preschool age and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before the Ford public hearing, in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual assault addressed to the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republic decided to approve the candidacy, this could be a violent reaction.
"The Republican Party has to deal with a small mess," said at the beginning of last week, Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, as NBC News reports.
"It is not only the vote of the Commission or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, but also the way in which the Republic has dealt with the situation and how Ford was dealt with," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, on one of the information channels, a group that assists in the election of the Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided into those who believe in the face of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more support.
The new YouTube survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said that they believed in Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents found that Kavanaugh was likely or probably lying at the time of the testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's press release, the FBI began an investigation into the charges filed by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, who is Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian reports.
Ford confessed last week to the Senate of the Judicial Commission that Kavanaugh under the influence of alcohol attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez argues that he was appointed to the Supreme Court to show her his genitalia during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web company plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Team Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web network, launches startups to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform — Solid — owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who have access to specific information.
In an exclusive statement for Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of creating Inrupt is "dominance over the world".
"We have to do it now," he said, referring to the start.
"The historical moment has come."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own "internet with personal data" or other POD.
It can include contact lists, mailing lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the internet store with personal data is that users absolutely depend on who has access to what information.
The company calls it "a personal capacity through data".
According to the company's president, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Currently, Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed for project work and a volunteer community.
Since this week, technology makers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, which from day to day causes a turn to the top of all their business models.
"Don't ask them for permission."
On Saturday, at the Media platform, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has had a great deal to do in the debate on network neutrality.
Invoking the Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely excited, thinking about the next era in the development of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Marking the Spiritual Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only spiritual Church of England, which in World War I was marked as a combatant by the Victorian Cross, was taught 100 years later in his home town.
Major Bernard Vann was nominated on September 29, 1918 for the race at Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he was marked by the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandsons discovered a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that the sending of the stone exactly in the hundredth anniversary of Grandfather's designation had a "extremely symbolic character".
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the Vann Plück led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under a strong shield from the field and machine guns".
He then rushed to the fire line and with “the greatest courage” led her to move forward, after which he singled out an attack on the position of the fields, destroying three of them.
The Vann people were killed by the German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72 years) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never be able to resist, but also something humble.”
With his brother, Dr. James Vanne, he placed the winner after the end of the parade by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to participate in the paradise" and added that "the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people".
Fans MMA didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, instead get the Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to watch the packed emotions of Bellator 206 and can't finally see the main fight.
The program could include 13 races in San Jose, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Moussai and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the battle, the visions in Britain were amazed at the change of the program to the Pepka.
Some were disappointed when they did not sleep until the early hours of the morning especially after seeing this struggle.
One of the fans on Twitter described the replacement for children as "some sick joke".
"In accordance with the Government's regulation, the content of this type is inadequate to allow it to be released at 6 a.m., which made it necessary to change the programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator's marketing and communication organization, when asked for transmission.
"Peppa pig, yes."
The president of Bellator's organization, Scott Coker, said they're working on a timetable to take into account future visions from the United Kingdom.
"When I think about the recurrence of the situation, I think we can fix it," Coker said.
"But it's Sunday 6th morning, so we won't be able to cope with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, we had a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical austere.
But it wasn't just a legal issue.
I can promise that this situation will not happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six — to a standard amount. We wanted to please fans too much and unfortunately we preferred.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jump in the water, says he grew up feeling worse than anyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to bring success.
24-year-old said he didn't realize that not all were like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs radio 4 station, Lauren Laverne said he was talking about gay rights to give another "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent would make him less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The usual leader of this program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months free of the disease.
As he appeared in the program for the first time led by Laverne, Daley said that as he grew up, he felt "less valuable" than others, because "the same thing about boys and girls was not socially acceptable".
He said: “To this day, this feeling of inferior value and being different is something that gives me the strength to be successful. ”
He said he wanted to prove that he was "something worth", not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double-brown Olympic medalist became the vocalist of the LGBT community and used his speech in this year's Community of Nations Games in Australia to appeal to a larger number of countries for the decriminalization of homosexuality.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy, that he could live open, without any involvement, and that he wanted to give another "hope".
Three times the world’s champion said that a man’s love — the American filmmaker Dustinie Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “was amazed. ”
Daley married the winner of Oscar (who is 20 years older than him) last year, marking that this age difference was never a problem for him.
"When you go through so much at such a young age," he meant his first 14-year-old Olympics and father's death three years later because of cancer, and he said it was hard for him to find someone of the same age who experienced similar crashes and falls.
The couple stayed in June with the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his perception of certain things had completely changed.
"Last year it was most important for me to win the gold medal," he said.
"And you know what? It's more important than the gold Olympic medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 — he wanted to take the lead.
"I couldn't tell him, "you won't be with us to be in the first place, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing. Just when he stopped breathing and died, I understood that he was not uninhabited," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a brothel.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life – jumping into the water before the crowd in the Olympic Games – it was the best feeling of the possible," he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — The Book of Heather Small — which accompanied him during preparations for the Olympic Games and which still makes him a dense skin.
Desert Island Discs program is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Lack of Mikkelson on the bench during the Saturday part of Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson sets a record Sunday when it plays his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but he will have to work on his form so that he doesn't print his fifth.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in every two years of the event, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as often happened in his case in the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend a day at the team climbing and working on improving his game in hopes of correcting the cause of his being sent to the bench.
A 48-year-old who has never given the simplest hits, even at the top of his career, is not well tested on the tight Le Golf National field, on which the wrong hits are unfathomably punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not encouraging enough for Mickelson, on Sunday's ninth match, he has to face the precise British Open winner — Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with debuter Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If America (with four points lost at the beginning of 12 singles) starts the game with a worm, the Mickelson game may prove extremely key.
Fury expressed confidence in his champion — he could not do anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, stuck me behind his back, hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
“He is very sure of himself.
He is in the gallery of fame and has led many of his teams to the game both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was playing two games.
I thought there would be more of them, but that's how it happened, and we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will kill Nick Faldo's record of the Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of his career at Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual achievement.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 wins and seven remissions on his account. Fury said his presence has led a lot to the team.
"It's funny, sarcastic, silly, funny and it's good to have it in the team's room," he explained.
"I think young players were having a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He's bringing his person a lot more than just a game."
Captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that a great deal of points can be shortened soon.
Thomas Bjorn, the head of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point of view before starting a single on the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult play.
The Danish won the 1997 Valderram field game, where, along with his accompanying Vice-Captain Seven Ballesteros, he had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the line of the year passed as short as possible, winning 141 1⁄2-131⁄2.
"Don't forget that we had a great advantage in the field of Valderram; we also had a great advantage in the field of Brooklyn where we lost, and in the case of the field of Valderram we won only with hair," said Bjorn, on the picture, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which gave us 10-6 in the field of Le Golf National.
Time will show me and all the members of the team that it's not over yet.
You're giving everything up tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything you can.
The end will only come when the points appear on the table.
We have a goal that is to win the trophy, and we need to focus on it.
From the beginning I said that I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who are on the opposite side — the best players in the world."
Bjorn, fascinated by the way his champions handled the difficult field, added: “I wouldn’t have done better.
But tomorrow it's something else.
They start a single tomorrow, and that's another question.
It's good to play with a partner when everything comes up, but when you play alone, your edge skills in golf are tested to the limit of possibilities.
It's a message that you need to pass on to the players, and it's all you have to do tomorrow.
The partner also has to give everything to himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will expect his competitors to achieve better results in a single match than in the game with his partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Sam Furyk experienced a great return to action the last day, being a member of the winning team in the Brooklyn field, after which he failed after the European team performed a "mud on the Medina field".
"I remember every word," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, was warming up to fight his champions on the last day.
"Tomorrow we will play 12 important games – you would like to start the game at a fast pace, as was the case in the fields of Brooklyn and Medina.
If this soil goes to one side, it's going to get a lot of pressure on the middle of the game.
We set our composition accordingly, and we set the boys in a way that would allow us to enchant tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to conduct a contract, putting Rory McIlroy in the main match, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmo, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other European team champions in the lead half of the program.
"I've decided on this group of guys in this order, because I think he'll be able to handle all the games," Bjorn said about his single election.
New German warship again late
The latest German military fleet should be used in 2014 to replace the old warships since the Cold War, but this will not happen until at least next year due to poor systems and rising costs at an alarming rate — as local media have.
The use of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was moved to the first half of 2019, as reported by the newspaper Die Zeit, referring to the words of the military spokesman.
The ship should be included in the warship in 2014, but it was necessary to introduce changes in this ambitious project as a result of the problems that emerged after delivery.
Four units of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the military mariner in 2007 will replace the older Bremen Frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped in a powerful work, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as technological solutions to prevent detection, including reducing radar, sub-red and acoustic footprints.
Other important features include longer periods between conservations — the exploitation of new frigates should be possible even for two years from the maternal port.
However, further delays mean that these modern warships, which will enable Germany to respond to the situation abroad, will be obsolete at the start of the service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the first pages of the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to give up the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the ship after delivery.
There was little information about the reasons behind the return, but the German media reported on a number of key software and equipment errors that made the ship useless in the war mission.
Especially important were software errors, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, about half the size of the Bremen class.
It has also proved that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its achievement and restricts the possibility of the warship of future modernisations.
It is believed that the 7000 tonnes of the Rhineland-Pfalz ship is twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to poor equipment, the problem also becomes the cost of the whole project — including crew training.
It is said to have reached a level of EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion), while the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the use of new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings of the fact that the power of the German fleet is flying.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, admitted that sailors "end up ships capable of being used".
He also said that this problem increased over time as a result of the withdrawal from operation of the old units without the provision of replacement ships.
He also expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg fleets could be included in the Navy fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of a Netoper
The new research carried out in the Highlands area is aimed at showing how the bats use the landscape when obtaining food.
Research results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these exceptional flying mammals and to help direct future actions to protect them.
The research conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will be carried out in the case of semi-trailers and small, brown bats with long ears and bats from the Red Neck family in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special registries will be deployed in key locations around the site to monitor the activity of netopers during the whole season.
NHS workers and volunteers will also conduct field tests using portable detectors.
The purpose of the expert sound analysis is to determine the frequency of signals sent by netopers and how to maintain individual species.
The map and report will then be developed to create a specific image of their landscape-wide behaviour.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Protection Adviser, hopes that the results will be made public, which are the most important sites for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of work related to the management of habitats, e.g. the creation of ponds, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for netopers and other related species.
The population of netopers in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which have an impact on the fences and the loss of settlements.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may also pose a threat, as well as beauties on flies and some chemical products used in building materials and even domestic cats.
The bats aren't really that blind.
However, because of nightly fishing habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in the catch.
They use the complex echolocation technique to search for crafts and obstacles on their way.
The NTS organisation, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 residential buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about the baton.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, grid checks, and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organisation has even set up the first and only dedicated netoper reserve in Scotland in the area of Thrave's residence in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of netoper.
David Thompson, the owner of the estate, says she's for the unopposed ideal territory.
"Threave has an excellent area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and great settlements.
However, there are still many unknowns in the matter of bats. The work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of monitoring the presence of netopers before entering conservation work in holdings, as the accidental destruction of one nest may kill 400 females and young people, which may lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
The netopers are protected — their killing, stabbing, or stumbling them, as well as their destruction is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a shock officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged public opinion to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and in many species we don’t even know how their populations are doing. ”
Ronaldo rejects charges of violence, while his lawyers intend to invite German magazines
Cristiano Ronaldo identified charges of violence against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are going to invite the German intelligence magazine Der Spiegel, who published these allegations.
The Portuguese attacker Juventus was accused of rape by an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel's Friday report, a dancer was to pay a woman $375 000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years), a few hours after the announcement of the charges, in an instagram transmission to his 142 million followers, identified these reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news," said a five-time winner of the gold ball.
“They want to be promoted using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's fine," the dancer added with a smile on his lips.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to invite Der Spiegel's magazine for proposals that have been called "an unacceptable declaration of suspicion in the area of privacy" – as Reuters says.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer would seek compensation for “moral damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years”.
We said we were going to take place in June 2009 in the hotel room Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
When Ronaldo and Mayorg met at the nightclub, they similarly went to the football room where he reportedly raped the woman anal — as is the case with documents filed in the district court of Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the alleged approach and told her that "99 percent is a good guy", which was visited by that "one percent".
According to the evidence, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was a mutual agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she was "feared" and "public harassment".
34-year-old says he wants to cancel the deal now, because he can still not forget the alleged departure.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this year he moved to Juventus after paying 100 million euros for him.
Brexit: Great Britain "would regret all the time" car manufacturers leave
The Great Britain "would regret it all the time", if after leaving the European Union she lost the world leader in car production, Minister of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "angrily concerned" when Toyota UK representative told the BBC in a report that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, production at the factory in Burnston near Derby will be temporarily stopped.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of border delays in the absence of agreement on Brexit could lead to job reductions.
The factory in Burnston, which produces Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without agreement, then production will be stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other British car manufacturers fear leaving the EU without agreement on how to operate cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern, as car manufacturers claim, the risks associated with the supply chain when the European Union leaves the UK without agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on the basis of "just-in-time", in which parts reach 37 minutes from suppliers both in Britain and in the EU in the case of cars produced on the order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without agreement, it may become more difficult on the border, which, according to the industry's representative, may lead to delays and partial disadvantages.
As the company representative said, Toyota would not be able to last more than one day without delivery to his factory in Derbyshire, which would stop production.
Clark said the Chequers Theresy May plan on future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to achieve the best of possible agreements that will allow us not only to enjoy our current success, but will also allow us to use this situation properly," said the BBC Radio 4 programme today.
"Not only Toyota's statements, but other producers also testify that we have to be able to continue what was on the very efficient supply chain set."
The Toyota delegation was unable to determine how long production will be stopped, but warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the company, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaton plant for 24 years and is a member of the U.S. trust council, said that the relationship is increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if the work is to be done, they will never be restored.
The Prime Minister said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan of our future relations with the European Union".
Meeting Trump with Rosenstein can be delayed again as White House is given
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "lated for another week" due to the ongoing fight against the highest court candidate Bretta Kavanaugh, as he filed for the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the possibility of interference of Russia in elections, the links between close collaborators Trump and Russia, and the potential difficulty of the President's action in measuring justice.
Whether Trump will release the Deputy Attorney General, threatening the same independence of Mueller, has been a hot topic for the month in Washington.
At the beginning of this month's New York Times, Rosenstein spoke on the subject of a hearing to record talks with Trump, as well as on the possibility of removing the president from his position on the basis of Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
On Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports as if he were going to smoke.
The deadline for meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, was Thursday.
Trump said he would like not to let Rosenstein go. There was a change in the meeting to avoid colliding with the Senate Judicial Commission hearing, during which the testimony was filed by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday Trump conducted a weekly FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's vote.
The Trump press nurse, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, and it may be moved for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'm sure I'll inform the press."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders had not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The program leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences were not caused by a lack of "centenary" television reporters, and she added: "I will not hide that they are "centenary".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The President-in-Office conducts more "questions and answers" sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We have met with numbers".
The press conferences will continue to take place, said Sanders, but “if journalists are able to directly ask the President of the United States questions, that is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we have done it very often. Press conferences will be held at such sessions, during which we can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
The solo press conferences are rare.
This week, the president in New York may have demonstrated why he did so, acting too freely and sometimes strangely in front of the assembled journalists.
Minister of Health writes to workers from the European Union employed in NHS Scotland in the face of Brexit-related concerns
The Minister of Health sent a letter to workers from the European Union who were employed in the shock health service to express their gratitude to the country and to ask them not to leave for Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter for less than six months until the UK leaves the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the costs of examining applications for "setled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer negotiations on Britain’s departure from the European Union continued, and decisions will be taken in the fall of this year.
The British government also intensified preparation for a possible outcome scenario without agreement.
I know it's a very distressing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU and beyond offer valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery as a result of a head injury
The shooting team Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, went through the operation to obtain a head injury on Saturday with Vanderbilt Commodores, who ended up defeating the Tennessee team with the result of 31-27, told Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, the top coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the racer was injured shortly before the end of the first half.
"He came to the side line, after which he landed on the ground," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombiem oxygen on the side line, then placed it on their noses and carried it out to carry out further tests.
The representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the nature/size of the injury yet", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a second-year student who has been released from the university's representation for a year to train her skills) is playing her first season in Tennessee State team after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday before the match ended, he had five strokes, which gave him 18 strokes throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
In line with the new plans of tourists buying from abroad, there will be higher treasure fees for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom. The funds thus obtained will be used to help homeless people.
This move is intended to enhance the success of Jeremy Corbyn's actions to attract a young electorate.
The levy will cover persons who do not deduct taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury Ministry thus provides that it will earn up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May informs today that a higher treasure fee will be charged to foreigners buying property in the United Kingdom and that additional funds will be provided to help homeless people.
This move is taken as an attempt to highlight Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract the young electorate with the promises of cheaper apartments and increase the burden of more profitable people.
Higher taxes will be imposed by individuals and companies not taxing in the United Kingdom. Additional measures will help the government to combat unemployment.
An additional fee — which is charged in addition to the current tax, including two years ago higher rates for other houses and rental apartments — may amount to up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects that this move will make it possible to earn even 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and hampering the purchase of the first house or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy property, and most of the time is spent outside the country, many wealthy regions — especially the capital — have become “a city of spirits. ”
The new rules come only a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call for a reduced treasure fee to help young people buy the first house.
He accused major developers of maintaining high real estate prices by occupying the area, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to remove the thresholds of cheap housing in order to eliminate the "dwelling scandal" in the United Kingdom.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including the regulation of rents and the end of the "no reason" show.
It also wants to grant local authorities greater powers in the construction of new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as prime minister, I was engaged in rebuilding the British dream of a better life for every next generation than before.
It also means the repair of our cherished housing market.
The Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy real estate here as hard as British residents.
For too many people the dream of their own home has become very remote, for this humiliation of the need to sleep on the street remains real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to become a Scottish picker"
Sunderland's coach, Jack Ross, says that his "most ambition" is to become a Scottish selector at some point.
This 40-year-old Scotland is working on the North-East club's health, which is currently taking third place in League One with a three-point loss in relation to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this year after he introduced the last season of the St Mirren club back to the Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to represent my country as a champion,
But I managed only to get to staff B," Ross told the BBC Scotland's Sports Sound in an interview.
“As a child I often watched with the father of the Scottish game in Hampden and it always drew me.
However, such a possibility will only come if I bring success as a club coach."
Among the former Ross in the position of Coach Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach Alloa Athletic says he doesn't feel upset, taking the role of so-called personalities in such a big club, rejecting earlier proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“I will be able to see if I can bring this club back to Prime Minister League.
Taking into account his structure and the amenities he has, there is no doubt where he is," he adds.
"It will not be easy to do this, but I'm sure I've been successful here, only if I succeed."
Ross's coach career lasted only three years. Previously he was an assistant coach in Dumbarton and for 15 months belonged to the Hearts training team.
Next, Allo helped reinvigorate after downgrading the third league, and in the next season, he led the St. Mirren team from the downhill to the championship.
Jack Ross says he now feels much more comfortable than when he played Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a real point of reference," says coach Alloa.
“I really believed that driving a team would be much better for me than playing.
It's going to be weird because as a champion, I've done well and I've achieved a few huge successes.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
You have to get through different situations every week.
They still meet me when it comes to stress and pressure related to coach work, but I feel good about this role.
I've always wanted to train others and now I'm doing it.
The entire interview at Sportsound can be heard on Sunday, September 30 in Scotland radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST time
Studies show that the best beer time is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday.
The summer flood caused a violent flow of customers to British pubs, but it took a look at the restaurant's network.
Studies have shown that in July sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s consulting company, who developed the data, says: “The continuous decline and longer than expected participation in the World Championships led to the results of July as a result of the conversions in pubs increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the profits of the restaurants dropped even more.
As recorded in June, 1.8 percent of the sales drop in restaurants in July has increased even more.
Drinking pubs and bars were the best they could do — their sales growth exceeded the drop recorded in restaurants.
The eating pubs also suffered during the floods, although not so much as the restaurant owners.
Looks like the people were just being pushed.
The sale of drinks in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent this month, and food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from RSM, who is conducting an analysis of the entertainment and tourism industry, says: “These results are reflected in the trend that we have observed since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the size of the 'outside home' consumption remain weather and major sporting or accompanying events.
The fact that restaurant networks are experiencing difficult moments, no wonder, although the sales drop of 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year will have a particularly significant impact if the constant cost reduction is taken into account.
The long and burning summer has come at the least favourable moment for the owners of the dining room and the time will show whether a little more moderate temperatures that we had in August will bring such a need for withdrawal."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting slowdown in the development of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which is responsible for monitoring sales in pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds.
One per five children has a secret account in social media that hides from their parents
Studies have shown that one per five children, some in their age of just 11 years, have a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and teachers
The survey carried out among 20,000 pupils of secondary schools showed an increase in the number of fake Insta pages
These reports raised concerns that the content of the articles is of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students have found that they have a "main" account showing their parents
One for five children — some in their 11 ’ s or so — has an account on social networks that do not reveal themselves to adults.
The survey carried out among 20,000 elementary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" — the name refers to the Instagram service where you can share photos.
These reports raised concerns that these accounts are intended to publish material of a sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of students have admitted that they have a certified "main" account, which shows their parents and also has a private account.
One of the mothers who, by chance, came to the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, met a teenager who told others to "violate her".
The study carried out in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters Association" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: “It is worrying that so many teenagers create their own places on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them”.
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics government
During the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics Elid Doyle, he was elected to the Management Board as a non-executive director.
Elid Doyle is the most resourced shock light bulb. President Ian Beattie has defined this move as a perfect opportunity for people who manage sports to benefit from her rich international experience that she has gained in the last decade.
“Eilid enjoys great respect for the Scottish, British and world light athletes and we are confident that its introduction to the board will bring great benefits to the Scottish light airballs,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very happy that I will be able to convey the votes of athletes to the Council, and I hope that I will be able to really help manage sports in Scotland.”
The American, who among his four gold medals in the Olympics, has won 200 and 400 metres in the Olympics in 1996 and is now regularly present in the BBC as an expert, cannot be the result of a transient blood attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I was hit.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would show me if I were to regain my ability and to what extent.
It was a secular job, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again and returned to training!
Thank you for all the words of support!"
An advertisement of lactators that compares mothers to cows stimulates extreme emotions on the Internet
The company producing lactators caused a noise on the Internet by publishing a commercial that compares breast feeding mothers to breast-feeding cows.
In order to announce the introduction into the market "first in the world of a quiet lactator to wear clothes", its producer, Elvie, published a teledic broadcast that emphasizes the freedom it provides to mothers.
She presents four real mothers dancing in the shade filled with the song, in which she hears the words: "Yes, I do, but I don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice, it's not just my tits."
Refren goes this way: “Spring them, pump them, feed them children, pump them, pump them, touch my lord.”
The advertisement, which was published on the company's facebook page, caused major online controversy.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them claim that it is inappropriate to joke about the "horror" that takes place in the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to the body, because their children are taken away after a few days from birth," one of the users wrote.
Elvie lactator can be treated with bistonosis (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
Of course, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can stop their children."
Someone else added: "This advertisement is completely overwhelmed by reality."
Another weapon of the clip — one of the women found the song to be “a fun one. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I kept breast feeding, I'd buy myself that way.
I felt like a cow when I took off my food.
The ad is a little crazy, but I'm not looking into it the second day.
It's a brilliant invention" - someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s fun advertising directed to mothers who pull food (often at work or toilet) and feel like ‘blood’.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced with lactators discreetly attached to their chest.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many feeding women felt like cows.
However, the Lactator Elvie is completely quiet, there is no cable or pipe and it can be worn unattended under the bistonous to feeding, which gives women the freedom to move, to keep children on their hands, and even to leave the house during the withdrawal of the meal.
Ana Balarin, a partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Laktor Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a brave and provocative premiere.
As we put together nourishing women and milk cows, we wanted to show all the challenges associated with the withdrawal of food, presenting at the same time in a fun and consistent way the incredible feeling of freedom that he provides.
It's not the first time that lactator Elvie hit the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week during the exhibition Marty Jakubowski appeared the mother of two children with this product attached.
Hundreds of immigrant children were secretly transferred to a rental camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained in immigration is increasing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border each month does not change properly. This is partly due to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and the principles introduced by President Trump's administration made it difficult to place children in sponsors.
Most sponsors are also usually undocumented immigrants who fear exposure to deportation if they report after a child.
Such a risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that from potential sponsors and other adult residents in the common economy, fingerprints would be collected, which would then be transmitted to immigration offices.
Last week, the senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who reported to be sponsors for children left without care.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had not been previously recorded.
“There are not 80 per cent of the people who are sponsors or who live with them in one domestic economy who are illegally resident in the country, and most of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That's why we keep chasing them," said Albence.
Secretaries say that in efforts to speed up the regulation of the situation of children, officials introduced new rules that require a part of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, as was the case with previous standards.
Much will be done through the videoconferencing, not personally, to ask the immigration judge to legalise their status.
Those who do not qualify for exemption will be deported immediately.
According to the shelter workers and reports published in recent months, the longer children are in detention, the easier may become uneasy or depressed, which may eventually lead to the explosions of aggression or the attempt to flee.
The defenders have found that these problems are even more serious in larger centres, such as Tornillo, where it is easier to ignore the signals that something bad is happening with the child.
They also added that moving children to a rented camp without providing them with adequate time for emotional preparation or a welcome of friends can exacerbate the trauma many of them are already struggling with.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
During his address to the UN General Assembly, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Valid al-Moual, also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in that country has lasted for eight years.
Mouala, who also plays the role of the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally staying in Syria under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he announced to the Assembly.
Moual says that "war on terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360 thousand people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to "run its holy battle until the territory of Syria" both from terrorist groups and from "all foreigners residing in it illegally".
Currently, there are approximately 2,000 American soldiers in Syria who are mainly trained by the Kurdish and Syrian forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad and advise them.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the country of war destroyed.
With regard to refugees, Mouale found that conditions were good enough for them to return, and he accused "some countries in the west" of "arousing unreasonable fear", which would discourage them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations for help in these returns," he said.
"They're policing things that should have a purely human dimension."
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad opposes the political agreement to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a buffer zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created the possibility of continuing political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has helped prevent a major Syrian attack supported by Russia in the province in which three million people live.
Mouale stressed, however, that the agreement has "a clear time frame", and expressed hope that military action will be measured in jihadists, including fighters associated with the Al-Qaeda People's Defence Front, who will be "destroyed".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to call soon for the first meeting of a new commission made up of members of the governing party and the opposition in order to draw up a sketch of the armed constitution of Syria and prepare for the elections.
Mouale outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the commission, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "to verify the records of the current constitution" and warned against ingestion.
Why Trump wins the election again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected to a second term in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers hope, his presidency will soon end by removing it from office and scandal.
It would certainly be "the most dramatic finish of the presidency so far".
As for now, there's no sign of fatigue in the eyes.
Since 2014, the results of the CNN channel's surveillance have doubled and reached more than 1.05 million views, and the MSNBC channel has nearly tripled to 1.6 million views.
According to Nielsen Fox News, on average, 2.4 million views are attracted in the hours of the highest visibility, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC channel "The Rachel Maddow Show" has achieved the highest results among cable television, attracting up to 3.5 million views of evening information programs.
"People fly like we go to the fire -- that's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, the lead producer of the ABC series "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy artist and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys", has another theory.
It mentions how she was driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The director said he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he mocks me," he replied.
Chaos has fun value.
Of course, reports from Washington could, as nothing else on television, judge the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of the association of immigrants' families or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged visions can afford.
In addition, this is not just about being a well-informed citizen, when you look at the panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of secret informants when writing the book "Fair", about Paul Manafort's shirt from the string for $15,000 (the "loaded dog clothes", as The Washington Post said) or about the implications of the shocking descriptions of President Trump's anatomy details revealed by Storm Daniels.
I'll never look at Super Mario like I used to.
“What he does is partly to remind the reality of the show in that every evening he delivers new content” said Brent Montgomery, Director General Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of the "Pawn Stars" about the changing volume and daily returns of the show Trump (as an attack on NFL league champions or Kim Dzong Una).
You can't allow yourself to miss out on the cut because you're going to have a problem.
When I met Mike Flesm this week, the weather on the northern coast of the Kauai island, where he had his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle looking at MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not avoid this, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Court Commission and was considering the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

Cash flow from outside to election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that after the electoral districts have been reorganized, as a result of which, in the race for one position, the two congressmen are now in office, up to the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania, the cash flow.
This newly created district of Pittsburgh is represented by a representative of the Democrats, Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district in Pennsylvania, which is largely covered with the 17th district.
The district maps were adjusted after the January judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled that the old districts were not fair, which gave the Republican priority and was incompatible with the Constitution.
The race in the new district 17 began with the fight to finance the campaign between the party’s main funding bodies — the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba was popular in Pennsylvania after winning hair in wide-ranging elections to the 18th round of elections that took place in March.
This position has been in the Republican for more than a decade, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this district.
Political experts gave the Democrats a minor advantage.
The United States considered Salwador's punishment for supporting China, but withdrew from this idea
The diplomats noticed that Dominicans and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite the slight opposition of Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a warm meeting with President Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until he was expelled by the partners of the Trump Organization management team, he had a hotel in Panama.
The officials of the State Department decided to revoke the heads of the American diplomatic missions from Salwador, Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the recent decisions to end Taiwan's recognition", said Heather Nauert in his statement this month.
However, the sanctions under consideration were to be imposed only on Salwador, who, according to estimates in 2017, received $140 million from the United States, inter alia, aid to combat drugs and support for development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were intended to limit financial aid and to grant visas to certain persons, would be very relevant to this Central American country, which is struggling with large unemployment and a high murder rate.
In the light of the progress made in international meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being in order to address the requests made by a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from being submitted to the United States.
In mid-September, the top-level administrations made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus doing all the consideration of sanctions against Salwador.
The diplomats say that at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, the Vice-President Mike Pence is to appear, which is to be a sign of the invitation to the meeting of the representatives of the administration.
Three American envoys returned quietly to Salwador, Panama, and Dominicans, which did not include any new harsh communications or punishments from Washington.
John Bolton, from the White House, refused to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal interpretations subject to the provision of anonymity.
Their relations were confirmed by an external analyst from the administration environment, who also said anonymously.
Learn History
Another element may be the report of the Special Prosecutor, Robert Mueller, on the possible impediment to the justice actions of President Trump, which is currently available to the public.
According to reports, Robert Mueller's investigation also examined whether Donald Trump's campaign had something to do with Russia's attack on the American elections.
If it changes the composition of Congress, President Trump will be held accountable during preparations for a re-election, and perhaps even before the jury.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump — or people on his equivalent positions in Europe — is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which decides how long it can last.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to take action against Hitler if only the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
It didn't work out, and we lost the chance to avoid the harvest years that followed.
History circles turn around such points of reference, speeding up or slowing down the inevitable course of democracy.
There are now several such points in front of the Americans.
What will we do if Donald Trump releases General Rod Rosenstein, a man who depends on the future of Robert Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since we found out in our paper that last year he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated that he wasn't looking for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inaccurate.
‘How do we react if the newly ordered FBI investigation into Bretta Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair or if it is appointed to judge the Supreme Court despite the credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we in half of our presidential term choose the person who will bring Donald Trump to the convention?
If we don't pass these tests, there will be difficult times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed — because of the lessons I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light up the sabab lights on that table marked with a swastika.
Having such an inheritance, how can I not look at the future optimisticly?"

Winner of the Rangers Club, Graham Dorrans, with optimism waiting for the match with the Rapid Vienna team
The Rangers take up Rapid Vienna on Thursday, realizing that the victory with Austria after the impressive Villareal surrender achieved this month in Spain will significantly increase their chances of qualifying for the G League of Europe Group.
Until 2:2 of Villareal's collision the knee prevented the assistant Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that this result works on the Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
"It did us good because Villarreal is in good shape," said 31-year-old.
“We went to this game with the faith that we will achieve something — and we won the point.
Maybe at the end we could still push them, but in general the resis is probably a fair result.
Spain was probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, this is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we will get three points, but this game will be difficult, because our opponent has won a good outcome in his last match. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the kibiks, we will pass and that and we will win a positive outcome.
Last year it was really hard because of all my contusions and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good in our places.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we'll be able to move on, leave the last season behind and bring success."
Fear of retirement savings sleeps women out of the world
Although the pollers knew exactly how they wanted to take care of them, they had little discussion with the family.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants found that she was talking to her partner about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take care of this topic," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
From what?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not speak your mind beforehand.
Talk to your counselor and family where and how you want to take care of yourself, because this choice will be an important factor in determining the costs.
Ask the financial advisor for help: He can help find a way to pay for these expenditures.
Long-term care funds may come from traditional police to such care, a hybrid police that allows you to pay cash to cover such expenses, or from your own property, as much as you have.
Prepare legal documents: You will avoid these court battles.
The designation of a trusted health care agent who will monitor it and ensure that the relevant persons act in accordance with your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider, too, the employment of a full-time employee who will handle the finances.
Choose a trusted person because she will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all accounts are paid if you are unable to do so on your own.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your parents in their old age suddenly need medical help and they’re just going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Print all the information to get them ready.
"This is not just about finances, but about who the doctors are," Martin asks.
“What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It's worth having such a plan under your hand."
Man repeatedly shot from a windmill in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times by the wind when he returned home from the evening party.
Four hundred kilocults were located in the area of Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, in Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The police identified the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST time as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see a rapist.
The injuries committed do not endanger the life of a man, and the police are asking to report to the witness of the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunamis that visited the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
No information from the Dongal cabupatene, which is located north of Pala, was obtained due to the failure of the rescuers to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and the cabin of Dongala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island. According to estimates in 2017, there were 379 800 people.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city’s 40th anniversary’s trade lasted.
This is done by kabupatene (administrative unit at a level below the province) extending along the north-west coast of the island over 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299,200 people.
The main branches of the Central Celebration economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed especially on the coast of the Danube Cape.
Another source of provincial income is mined nickel, but they are mainly located in Morowala, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to information from the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of Disaster Impacts, over the last 100 years earthquakes and tsunamis have visited Palu and Dhakal several times.
In 1938, the tsunamis that hit Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunamis in west Dongalli.
Indonesia is on the active Pacific ring of fire, which causes earthquakes to occur on a regular basis.
The biggest earthquakes in recent years:
2004: The great earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, making it more than half in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, the western coast of Sumatra visited a series of strong earthquakes.
On the island of Nias, hundreds of people were killed by the Sumatran coast.
2006: In southern Java, Indonesia’s most isolated island, there was an earthquake of 6,8 degrees, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: Near the town of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra, there was a earthquake of 7.6 degrees.
As a result, more than 1,100 people died.

The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested under the charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidates for Vice-President, Sir Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from Vasilla in Alaska, 29 years of age, he was arrested with domestic violence, difficulties in reporting and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when the suspect's friends tried to call the police to report a crime, he took her phone.
The KTUU station reports that Palin is in custody following Mat-Su and has a defined bail amount of $500.
According to her information last Saturday, she stood before the court where in her defense speech she said she was “innocent for sure”.
There are three Class A violations in the Fire, which means he can be punished even in the year of imprisonment and $250,000 in fines.
He was also accused of exceeding Class B, for which he threatened the punishment of the day of imprisonment and fines amounting to $2000.
This isn't the first time that Palina's been charged with crime.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is now pending before the Austrian court of veterinary claims.
In January 2016, it was accused of domestic violence, of hindering the submission of the report and of the possession of weapons in a state of uncertainty as a result of this incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016 a group of veterans criticised Sarah Palin, who linked aggressive behavior of her son to a purasian stress team that she had acquired during her service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died as a result of the earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of the Friday earthquake on the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and connectivity are not functioning and the number of victims is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake took place near the central part of the island of Celebes, located on the north east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
In social media, movies show a moment of disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were on the beach in Pala, where the festival was held.
Federal prosecutors demand death sentences for the suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors from New York demand that Sayfull Saipov be executed for a suspected terrorist attack in New York, which resulted in the death of eight people. This is a rare punishment — it has not been committed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out an attack, which took place in October on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, the 30-year-old Saipov was said to have used the hired Home Depot truck, which scattered pedestrians and bikers on his way.
In line with the New York South District's notification of the intention to require a death penalty to justify its need, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "whole" killed eight victims and "whole" caused serious bodily injuries.
According to the court's paper, both of these charges threatens the death penalty.
Several weeks after the federal court's attack, Saipov filed a 22-position indictment, including eight counts of murder in illegal activities, which is the procedure usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and the rejection of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the organisation of the attack required "solid planning and thinking". The way Saipov conducted it was defined as "rebellious, cruel and immoral".
“Sayfully Habibullaevic Saipov has caused the harm, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca” – states a notice of intention.
Five of the victims were citizens of Argentina who stayed in New York touristically.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the South New York District ten years ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but finally in September 2009 he heard the verdict.
The death penalty as a result of the federal case was last committed in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenbergach. Marriage was lost after two years before they were convicted of conspiracy and espousal towards the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were lost on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's court documents, which come from Uzbekistan, he did not show any conscience within a month of the attack.
The police say he told the investigator he's feeling good about what he's done.
According to Saipov's indictment, he told the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS films he watched on the phone before the attack.
According to the police, the ISIS flag was also required to be suspended in his hospital room.
The defendant's action against 22 counts as innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders from Saipova's office, said they were "depressed for obvious reasons" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and the rejection of life without the possibility of early release from the guilt will only prolong the suffering that these events caused to all interested parties," he said.
Saipov's defence team asked the prosecutors not to demand death sentences.
Mr Torys said that NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
During today's protest, which took place during the tourist conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people".
They were the leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians must "feel hot" from Eurosceptics when one of the parliamentarians suggested that they should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
A Conservative MP, Peter Bone, told demonstrators in Birmingham that if Farage was the secretary of Brexit, "the United Kingdom would already be outside the Union".
However, the addition of the remaining to the Community's individual protest against Brexit, which took place in the city, further stressed the weight of the commitment of its deep-separate series, which stands before Theresa May.
Your Prime Minister is trying hard to implement his compromise plan with the Chequers among the Brexit supporters, its opponents, and the European Union itself.
Her allies claim that despite the contradictions, she will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and the Eurosceptics forces and the Laborists to make a choice between her proposal and "chaos".
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to "send a plan with the Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should become a full-time agent, which should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were to do so, now we would be outside the Union," he said.
A member of Wellingborough added, "I support Brexit, but we have to throw out a plan from the Chequers."
Presenting our opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in world wars for the sake of being subject to anyone now.
We want to establish our rights in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that the citizens had changed their opinion since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain in the Union is completely false".
At the demonstration, Brexit Andrea Jenkyns, from the tourist party, was also supported, who told reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, please listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not happy with the general support, the opposition will not vote on it, our party or our activists who drive the streets and who chose us, and they don't support it.
Please drop out of the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a statement addressed to Prime Minister May, she added: "The premiers keep their positions when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said that politicians taking part in the demonstration must "be hot" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between us — people — and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you do it'."
Turning to a disillusioned crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians on the edge of Brexit’s betrayal feel hot.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country, which has given us victory in the referendum on Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
At that time, Brexit’s opponents massed through the city to the center where a two-hour demonstration took place.
The activist's garst was wearing "Torysi v. Brexit" banners after the group was set up this weekend.
Laborist activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, ridiculed conservatives for problems with the security of the party app at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who claim that they can organise computer systems and all technology to support the Canada Plus Plan, a liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
‘This is a complete farce.
There's nothing like good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "seriously consider" candidate for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after November's elections "he will seriously consider candidacy for the president".
According to The Boston Globe, a Democratic representative from Massachusetts spoke of his future when he met with the elections that took place on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trump, will apply for reelection in November. Her opponent will be Republican representative, Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 elections.
It is now said that in the 2020 elections, Warren can defeat Trump.
The Saturday event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters in the city hall formula, since Donald Trump took over the board.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for the president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to repair our own government — and she also means a woman on the top.”
Arresting the death squad of the LSU player, Wayde Sims
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana reported on Saturday on the arrest of a suspect on Friday shooting, where a basketball player from the LSU, Wade Sims, died.
The Baton Rouge police department informed of the arrest of 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson at a conference that took place at 11:00 Eastern Time.
On Friday, a shot with a request for help in identifying the male was published.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims died as a result of a shooting near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot with firearms in his head, as a result of which he died," said via police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to service 247sports.
Wade stood up for his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, had a gun with him and shot Wayde.
After the arrest, during which he did not resist, he was taken to a police station in East Baton Rouge County.
A 1.98 m junior Wayde Sims was raised in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches, at which last season he started 10 times, during which he spent on the park on average 17.4 minutes, won 5.6 points and counted 2.9 collections for the match.
Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's command enabled him to win with Sebastian Vettel
Since the time that Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mercedes team's command will have a major impact on the outcome of the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, began very well and almost beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two circuits and forcing Vettel to attack his colleague from the team.
Vettel went to the service point as the first one and allowed Hamilton to go under a peleton, which should determine the race's bad.
The racer Mercedes went into the boxing room in the next round and appeared behind Vettel, but after the action around the circle, which resulted in Ferrari's reluctantly leaving the inner part of the road, risking the push for a double-movement rival to defend the position on the third round, Hamilton moved to drive.
Max Verstappen started off at the end of the stake and at the end of his 21st birthday, at the end of the first round, he was in the seventh place.
Then, through much of the race, he led because he did not change the tire in order to complete the fast finish and take over Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he went to the service point at around 44, but in the remaining eight circles he was unable to speed up. The fourth place took Raikkonen.
“It was a difficult day because all weekend Valtteri did a great job and turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The whole team gave everything to take the first two," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad speech body.
During the meeting that took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump met with Senator Diana Feinstein, who maintained that she did not disclose the contents of the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which she accused the Judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the statements made by Christina Ford before the Justice Senate Commission, and he said that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "slow, evil and lying".
"What could happen is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have witnessed for a few days when we see the anger when we see people who are angry, angry, angry, and lying," he said.
"We see what was published and revealed, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we didn't reveal," he added, depriving the senator.
Diana Feinstein received a letter from Christine Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and her contents ran out at the beginning of September.
"I didn't hide Dr Ford's insinuation, I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein confessed to the commission, as the newspaper The Hill reports.
“She asked me for discretion, and I did not disclose these contents, according to her request.”
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented on them this way at a Saturday meeting: “I’m telling you, it was really an evil speech.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst language I've ever seen in my life."
By continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, whose three women have been accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats use insinuations for their own purposes.
‘They are determined to take over all measures.
You see, wickedness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take over authority and control," said the president, according to Mediaite's report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In the match with Dundee Patrick Dwyer got two goals for the Giants team
The Dundee Stars Club has rescinded its Friday game in the Elite League with the Belfast Giants team, winning the revenge match on Saturday at 5:3.
The giants quickly won a two-pronged victory over Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownne leveled the result, after which Dwyer reruned the Giants.
Francois Bouchard reassessed the result by winning a goal for the Dundee team, after which two gates shot by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen marked her victory.
It was the third lost in the Elite League season for the subcontractors Adam Keefe, who won the Dundee team at Belfast 2:1 in the early Friday evening.
Both teams met in this season four times — the first three matches won by the Giants.

The giants who lost their last five matches, the next match will be at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies, helping hundreds of people on the plane to escape from the earthquake
The air traffic controller from Indonesia was called a hero after he died, helping to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people aboard.
More than 800 people died, and many were considered dead after the great earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, causing tsunamis.
In the region there are still intense secondary shocks, and many people were imprisoned in the city of Paul.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position in the scattered flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pal.
He was there to make sure that the Batik Air flight ( flight number 6321), which was just on the start line, was safely launched.
Then he jumped out of the tower when it seemed to him that they were about to crash.
He died in the hospital.
According to the Australian ABC News spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the control decision probably saved hundreds of people's lives.
We organized a helicopter from Balikpapan to Borneo to take him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, Anthony left this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"This message broke our heart," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths can reach thousands. The national disaster management agency informs that the possibility of access to the city of Dongal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that the harvest of death is growing, because many bodies are still under the bushes and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency.
Six - foot - long [6 m] waves destroyed Paul, where the mass funeral of the victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News station: “Ambulans will constantly import bodies.
There's no drinking water.
Small shops are loaded."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is coming to the rescue, but we don’t know what we will stand for.
It's already a tragedy, and it might be even worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, approached the army, saying: “All of you, please, work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
This year Indonesia has already seen the earthquake that killed over 550 people on the island of Lombok.
The plane crash in Micronesia — Air Niugini lines indicate that one person is missing after the plane crashed on the lagoon
The airlines operating flights that crashed on the lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific reported that one person was missing. Earlier they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the flying plane.
Air Niugini reported that according to data on Saturday afternoon they could not count one man who traveled by feral plane.
They made sure that they and the local authorities, hospitals, and investigators were trying to find him.
However, they did not respond immediately to requests for additional details concerning the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water during the pilots landing on Chuuk Island, local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew members.
The officials informed on Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airlines said there were six passengers left on Saturday in the hospital, all in stable condition.
It is not clear what was the cause of the disaster, and we are also unaware of its exact course.
Airline and U.S. Navy warplanes claim that the plane landed on the lagoon not far from the starter.
According to some witnesses, he fell out of the dog.
American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was coming very low.
"That helped us a lot," he said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to get through the running water to get out of an emergency tow plane.
According to him, crew members panicked and yelled, and he himself suffered a dangerous head injury.
The U.S. Navy military reported that in the rescue, the mariners who were working nearby on the modernization of the coast also helped to transport the people to the shore by means of a steaming boat before the plane sank to the depths of about 30 metres.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database, 111 people have been killed in the last two decades in the disasters of aircraft belonging to the airlines registered in Papua New Guinea. However, Air Niguini does not exist.
The analyst reconstructed the night events when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor concluded the submission of evidence in the retrial of the male accused of burning alive women in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Justice Department, Paul Rowlett, has been testifying for hours as a court in the field of information analysis.
He described to the judges how with cell phone records he replayed the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
As reported by the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he had obtained location data from various cell phones that showed that Feral Night Tellis was from Chambers.
When they confirmed that at the time when Quinton was supposed to be with his friends, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interview Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford said he wasn't in town that day.
To the prosecutors' question about whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he replied that "he lied because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another insecurity is Tellis that he's known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis he removed her contact details from the phone, as well as text messages and connections.
"He got her out of his life," Hale said.
The final defense will begin on Sunday.
The judge said that the case would probably be handed over to the jury on the same day.

Another black?
Nania from New York invites a couple to be released after "racist" SMS
Nania from New York invites a couple for her release from work on a racist basis after receiving a misdirected text, in which the mother of the child complains that she is a "other black person".
The couple objected, as if they were racists, comparing the poem to the "santage".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly constricted when it turned out that the new guardian, Giselle Maurice, who had just arrived at the first day of work in 2016, was a blacksmith.
“NOEEE, THE SINGLE black person,” she wrote to her husband in her text.
Instead of sending him to him, however, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post newspaper, when Plasco-Flaxman realized that he was a full-fledged gaff, she released Giselle Maurice, claiming that the hearty ninja, which is African-American, was wrong to perform her duties, and she was also expecting ninani from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice received a day's pay and was then sent to Uber's house.
Now, the compensation is claimed from a pair of compensations of $350 per day for six months, which was initially employed with the residence, although she did not sign the contract.
"I want to show them that such things are not done," said the Post newspaper on Friday and added "I know it's discrimination".
The couple supported the charges of racism, claiming that the end of their cooperation with Maurice was justified because they feared that they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t intend to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco to the Postman.
"Would you trust your children the person you have offended, even if it happened because of a mistake?
Your new-born child?
Let's go."
Comparing the poem to "santage", Plasco said that his wife was born only two months earlier and was in "very difficult situation".
"Do you intend to blow up something like that?
It's not too nice," he added the investment banker.
Although the case has not yet been brought before the court, the public opinion quickly issued a few rulings in the social media, criticizing it for its behaviour and way of thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of the books about Paddington were afraid that readers would not feel connected to the talking mission.
The author’s daughter, Michael Bonda, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s warm reception, says: “It’s hard to find the person who read it for the first time before the book was released.
It's very funny now that we already know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She claims that her father, who, before a small plush mouse inspired him to write a book for children, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was certain that his work would be rejected. He also adds that after his death last year 60, the book was published as a "sweet and sweet".
Paddington, described as a “very important member of our family”, says her father was in secret proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, he didn't fight," he adds.
“But because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost like you had a child who achieved something — you feel proud of him, though it is not your merit.
I think Paddington's success has been seen in less than that way.
Although he himself invented it and created it, he always gave his own merits to Paddington."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter was landed, she was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life for free.
"Nad called regularly and said it's really bad that he probably won't get out of it," says Tanya Ednan-Laperous.
"Then he called to say that Natasha will die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be home soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart working slowly stopped working and were removed from the body.
She died a while ago, and that was the end of it all.
I could just sit down and wait for it to develop.
I couldn't go out or cry or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to hold on."
At the end of Tanya Ednan-Laperous, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, came aboard with other passengers, unaware of the anguish she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
I had my head down, and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt all-encompassing compassion for Nada.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Posts from women in mourning to help prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women, whose loved ones committed suicide, try to take others away from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting on the Welsh Bridge post office with inspiring messages and phone numbers, under which people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he became depressed, and at the age of 18, he took his life.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," he says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a well-predicted chef with a remarkable smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
They always said they could explain every room to him."
But before he died, he quit his job because he was “in a really black place. ”
In 2014, Brother Tyler was 11 years old and he found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always afraid of the effect of domination."
Sharon Davis created the cards “to tell people that there are people to whom you can turn and who you can talk to, even if you only know them.
Don't sit still, talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother died, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years.
"Nothing said that he felt upset, sad or something," he says.
“A few days before the birth of God, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was already in the world, and when the kids opened presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It broke the hole in the family.
It's distracting us.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh depends on Italy because the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought that if we were really able to get what we asked for - a temporary and limited investigation - perhaps we could achieve some uniformity," Jeff Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the Commission would "depart" into anti-impasse camps.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican voters want an FBI investigation?
All their desire comes from time to time.
The elections to the Congress are just a few weeks away — November 6, when, according to estimates, the Republic loses its chances of choosing a particular person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has already raised a phone to call the senators and to appeal to the support of Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of the president.
What happens when the FBI prepares a report?
A vote will take place at the meeting of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not certain whether Brett Kavanaugh will obtain at least 50 senators' votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under the governments of Kima, the number of refugees from North Korea is small
According to South Korean legislator Kim Dzong Un, since seven years ago, the number of people fleeing North Korea to South has fallen.
In quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of the United Nations, Park Byeong-seug said that 1127 flights were recorded last year, and in 2011 – 2706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more detailed border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates taken by human smugglers.
Pjongang did not issue a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally proposed for South Korea citizenship.
According to the Seoul authorities, since the end of the Korean war in 1953, the border has been illegally crossing over 30,000 Koreans from the North.
Most of them run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than a strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the Koreans.
The Chinese consider refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back to the country.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is theoretically still in war, has clearly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pjongang, where talks were held on the negotiations on denuclearisation, which had previously been in the deadlock.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Dzong Un, which took place in June in Singapore.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of failing to make progress on this issue.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no doubt about our national security and, in these circumstances, there is no possibility that we could unilaterally defend ourselves as the first," Ri said in a speech that he spoke before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavanaugh "the hysterical" and claims that he is not allowed to work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Bretta Kavanaugh "history" and said that he was not naturally able to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi delivered those words during the interview she gave on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman acted in this way, she would be regarded as a 'history'," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony that Kavanaugh presented on Thursday before the Justice Senate Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied charges of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At times during his opening speech, Kavanaugh experienced strong emotions — almost screaming and losing his speech when discussing family matters and the age of high school.
He also clearly won the Democrats from the Commission, setting out the charges against him, "a greek and coordinated call for reputation" organised by the Liberals, who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that according to her testimony, Kavanaugha showed that he was not allowed to work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think that he himself has been disqualified by issuing these statements, as well as by the way he attacked Clintons and Democrats," she said.
She was asked if she would try to withdraw Kavanaugh from the office if he was nominated and if the Democrats had won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi abstained.
"I say so: if he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also be in the court where he is currently working," he said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelos added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaucha on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial because it is considered a conservative judge.
During the corroborating case, Kavanaugh ignored questions as to whether he would violate some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to introduce a historical court, a former person who will expect us to say 'although it is wonderful'," Pelosi added.
And women have to control her.
It's a true diet, months, and years of raging fury, and she can't throw it out of her face without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
"It's quite common, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was the head of a company helped me a lot. She said that she also cried when she was angry, but she thought that when she was upset and started crying, she would talk to the person she was talking to, ‘You probably think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm mad.
He's still doing his own thing.
I thought it was great."
The lice are permissible as the entry of anger on the part because they are in fact misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories of one of the first crews in a man - dominated office is how one time I started crying out of unresolved anger.
"Never let them see how you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a member of the Congress of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat called Monkey Business and he got out of the race, frustrated at the Patricia border, she realized that she could actually consider the idea of a self-sponsored candidate for the president.
"It wasn't a thoughtless decision," she said, laughing, 30 years later.
“The election was already held by seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone has defined this situation as 'King Snow and Seven Magnificents'."
As the campaign has been going on for a long time, Schroeder has been addicted to fund-raising and promised he won't join the race if he doesn't get $2 million.
It was a battle to lose.
She then discovered that some of her supporters, who gave the man $1,000, had only 250 for her.
"Do they think I have any discounts?" she wondered.
During the talk, in which she announced that she would not be conducting a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotion — gratitude for those who supported her, frustration over a system that made it so difficult to collect money and to turn to the voters, not the delegates, and angered about sexism — that her voice got stuck in her throat.
"You might think I've gone through a nervous breakdown," he recalls the press reactions.
"You might think that Kleenex is sponsoring me.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my grave.
"She cried?"
What benefits can the economic war between the United States and China bring to Beijing?
The economic wars between the United States and China have been horrifying and, although the battle is still ongoing, in the longer term, the conflict between these countries can be beneficial to Beijing — experts say.
The first warning was shot this year by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposing duties on China's key export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week following the introduction of new tariff rates for goods worth $200 billion (150 billion) which resulted in the taxation of half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Every time, Beijing was separated by nature, lastly raising taxes on American goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
The Chinese are determined to be responsible for any US hit, and it does not seem that the second economy in the world will soon end.
The push for Washington to withdraw is to accept the demands, but the public contempt for the United States would be too overwhelming for President Chin, Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing was well playing its cards, the pressure resulting from the US trade war could in the long run strengthen China by reducing the dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic chaos in any country is in fact much more dangerous than the observers have previously granted," said Abigail Grace, an Asian researcher at the Center for New American Security tank.
According to the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, "prepared" to return refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for a voluntary return of refugees, and asks for assistance in rebuilding a country destroyed by more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Valid al-Moual, said conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation in our area is now more stable and safe by means of progress in combating terrorism," he said.
In an effort to restore normality, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been fulfilled so that refugees who have to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic movements measured in their daily lives and maintenance measures can voluntarily return to it.
According to the UN estimates, Syria has left more than 5.5 million citizens since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mouale said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept aid under the conditions covered or offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe threatens to win the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018, winning the US team from 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
In the European soil, the United States has already lost six of its ranks and since 1993 has not won Ryder Cup Cup in Europe.
Europe recovered the trophy when, under the leadership of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it won 14.5 points that were needed to conquer the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who was not well for most of the tournaments, hit a ball from the base directly to the water at the 16th PAR3, giving the same match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined through all rounds and became one of the four players who since 1979, when this tournament took place for the first time in the current format, managed to achieve the result 5-0-0.
American Jordan Speeth was eliminated by 5&4 by the lowest ranking player from Europe, Thorbjorna Olesena from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the highest position in the world ranking, lost two dolls before the last doll with Englishman Ian Poulter, for which it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
Hispan Sergio Garcia, who has already taken part in eight of these tournaments and has won 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t stop today.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm so happy to get back to the pub.
It is the success of the whole team and I am glad that I could help," said the excited Garcia after winning the team from Europe.
He gives a stick to his cousin, John Rahmo, who won the single American golf legend, Tiger Woods, with a result of 2&1.
"I feel the incredible pride of Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all the matches in France and now has results 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
It's unspoilt statistics, like one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 of the most important titles and only stopped Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had a whole weekend problem with finding a race, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
“ I am proud of the boys, ” said his American captain, Jim Furyk, after a disillusioned performance.
At some point in the morning, we pressed some Europeans.
We're out of here.
Heads up before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way forward.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of excitement for the opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
