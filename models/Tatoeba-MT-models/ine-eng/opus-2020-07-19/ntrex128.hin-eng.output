The AM of Welsh (members of the constitution) is concerned with 'repeat images'
Some members of the parliament objected to the suggestion that their term should be replaced by MWP.
The reason for this is that the name of the parliament has been changed and the plan has been made to establish Welsh.
All AMs connected with politics are concerned that it can make them laugh.
A lab AM said "Do not add this to Twp and Pwp" was concerned about this.
For readers out of Wales: in Welsh, towp means stupid and pwp means dirty.
One Play AM said the whole group was "not happy" and suggested other options.
A Welsh political party said that his group was "free-thinking", but he took note of the fact that verbally minor changes could be made to the MWP.
In this context, the w expression in Welsh is made exactly as the letter u in the Yorkshire English expression.
The legislative parliamentary committee that is currently preparing the draft resolution said: "What members of the committee are called upon to say, any descriptor's final decision will certainly be a matter for the members themselves."
According to Wells government Act 2017, the Welsh parliament has the right to change its name.
In June, the Foundation was informed of the results of the public advice in which much more support was given to reforming the parliament.
In the case of the title of the AM position, the support supported the members of Welsh, or WMP, but the most supported in the public advice was the MWP option.
Obviously, AM is suggesting a number of other options, but lateral officials are having a lot of difficulty in obtaining common agreement for Elaine Jones, they hope that they will submit legal proposals for change within a few weeks.
Other changes will also be included in the working methods of the House in the drafting of the law for changes, including the format of the rules and the comitology system for AM's incompatibility.
AM will receive the final vote on the question of what they should be asked to say when discussing the law.
Macedonians are going to gather to rename the country
They'll think on Sunday that they have to change their country to "Republic of North Macedonia" or not."
A speech was given to the Mashur municipality to resolve the old dispute with Greece, which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has been very insistent on the fact that his northern neighbor's name tells of his country and has repeatedly been affected by the words of his membership in Jehu and NATO.
The Macedonian president says they will ignore the protests on the name change.
Although Prime Minister Zoran Zew and his supporters have argued that the change in name is only due to the inclusion of Jehu and NATO.
The churches that are falling in Harlem have reduced the singing of St. Martin’s hours.
Mr. Adams said, "The elderly I spoke to about history are saying that there were times and churches on every occasion."
"Today, it's all going to end."
He knows that he's getting less of a time.
They said, "The people of the Pharaoh are a different people."
"There are now no living rooms in the neighborhood where people go every day."
For churches, they are concerned that the money that they sell will not go on for a long time, according to the expectations of the leaders, "and these money will soon end or later the leaders will come to the right place from which they started."
He added that the churches might have been transformed into real estate buildings, where people living in a variety of places would not help to protect the remaining places around them.
They said, "There will be a growing trend in these buildings for those who are buying houses as real estate, and in this way it will come at a time when these churches will be completely closed, because it is not possible that most of those who have acquired the property will become members of these churches.
A decade after Saint Martin in 1870, the Black Metropolis - Metropolitan Community of Harlem had been built by both churchgoers before they became Communists.
The fundamental cavemen of the Methodist religious community passed away in the 1930s.
These were the houses of the sodomites, which were round about to worship.
At St. Martin, the priest John Howard Johnson was captured by an Arab religious community who led the removal of the Hiera sales on 125th Street, the place was the main place for shopping in Harlem, here opposed to keeping or promoting the people of the desert.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but it was started here after it was redesigned by the followers of Father Johnson.
Father Johnson’s son and Saint Martin’s successor, David Johnson, proudly called the work “Opening doors for the poor.”
An hourly specialist in July described it as "a cultural heritage" and "a precious historical instrument".
The University of Michigan expert Tiffany Nji also noted that this was the first hour of the world played by the Arabic musician Dionysio A. Lind, they played a very large hour in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merrieveder told us that they were not placed in St. Martin's place.
Whatever happened in Saint Martin in the past few months, it became a complex story of sculptors and carpenters, some of which were appointed by the church's general leaders and the rest by the places of religion.
The Westry (which is the property of worship) was authorized by the general leaders of Paris (the priests of the district) - worried about whether the land would "request to meet the guests" for the Westry, whether or not it was included in the appointment of the founders and architects appointed in the Westry.
Some local priests complained about a lack of clarity on the part of the country.
A 13 - year - old teenager has been injured by an attack by an attack by a gangster
The authorities say that on Saturday, a 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark and injured him, while he was taking a bullet in California on the opening day of Lobster Cien.
The attack took place between the banks of Ensinitas before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel from San Diego's KSWB TV said that on Saturday morning he was talking to his friends for about half an hour, at the time he heard a boy crying for help, and then he came with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel told her that earlier he thought the boy was crying out to catch the cry, but then he felt as if he was crying, 'I'm cutting something!
I'm cutting something!'
Hammeel said that when he saw the boy, he found that the boy's bones were broken.
Hammeel said, "I have called everyone out of the water. There is a shark in the water."
In San Diego's Red Children Hospital, a teenager was diagnosed with a serious condition.
The population of the attacking shark has not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gills reported in a news report that a few weeks ago a shark was found in the area, but it was found that it was not the dangerous population of sharks.
Gills added that the upper part of the plague is seriously damaged.
For the purpose of testing and security, the authorities have blocked access between Casblad's pontoons for 48 hours and between Synitas's Sammis.
Gills reported that there are more than 135 shark populations in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Plans to go to Sainsbury's in the UK Boot Market
Sainsbury's Boutty products are being added to the Department Store Style Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams.
In spite of the continuing decline in fashion and household equipment sales, it is going to be included in the UK's 2.8 billion pounds-based boutique market, these volumes will be tested in 11 stores in the country, and if this plan succeeds, the next year will be increased to more stores.
Introduced into the supermarket, the purpose of which is to find its place in the market after bringing TV, microwave and household goods.
Sainsbury's explained that this would be the first time that it would bring up 3,000 products to be doubled by the brand, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing products of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more opportunities with branded products found in Boots' shop.
Supermarket is also starting its botanical makeup products again, so that most products are vignette-friendly - it will quickly increase its demand in small-sized shops.
In addition, the Perfume Riteller Fragrance Shop will also examine the two stores of Sainsbury's, the first of which was opened in South London last week, and the second of which will be open at the end of this year in Bermingham.
More and more efforts are being made to increase people's guests in the online shopping and local supply store, or the retail market, in order to reduce the demand for food every day.
Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, Mike Kup, said that people like the department store on the outlet would come faster because the supermarket is trying to get rid of Aldi and Lidl, more services and non-food suppliers.
Sainsbury's hundreds of stores are putting Argos's outlaws in the store and two years ago, since it brought both peace, it has also opened up a number of stores, indicating that renting has been promoted and more profitable.
Supermarket had failed in the last attempt to re-market the butt and pharmaceutical products.
Sainsbury's had worked with Boots in the early 2000s, but in its supermarket, the distribution process had to end this joint business because of the distribution of medicines in its supermarket.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold the company's 281 stock at 125 million pounds to Selesio, owner of Lloyds Farms Chen, after which a new strategy appeared.
It stated that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, together with La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in addition to many of the best laser scanner brands.
Business director Paul Mills-Hex of Sainsbury said: "We have changed the shape of our boot products so that we can improve relationships for our customers.
In particular, we have also joined trained staff who will help us to give advice.
We have built our brand circle from the needs and attractive environments of every person, and the convenient places, which means that we have reached the attractive destination of bet products that challenge the old ways of buying."
Peter Jones declared 'disgrace' on the separation of Willubi from the 11 million pound.
To focus on its new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, when the TV spokesperson Holly Bilubi decided to separate himself from 11 million pounds for the lifestyle brand business of Dragons Den, Peter Jones.
Billy doesn't have time for his homeowner and accessory brand True.
The trade of these two was compared to the Goop brand of Guinea's Paltro.
This 37-year-old Morninger announced separation on Instagram.
Holly Bilubi finally separated himself from the company of the lifestyle brand with Dragons Den's Star Peter Jones, so that he could focus on his new best contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources have found that when TV's Golden Girl released Tuesday, Marlo, at the headquarters of Jones, in Binghamshire, admitted that she was separated from her new salary -- worth 1.5 million pounds -- she was upset about it, which means that now there is not enough time for her homemaker and accessory brand True to give it.
The comparison of the company was being compared to the Brand Goop of Guinea's Paltro and was considered to double the estimated 11 million pounds given by Willubi.
37-year-old Willubi announced on Instagram that she was separated from True, then Jones left Britain to go to his holyde home.
One source said: "Truly was once the highest in the priorities of the movement.
It was believed to be his long-term future, which led to the brand going a long way over the next few decades.
His commandment, and that which he did, troubled every man that were bound with him that day.
What happened on Tuesday, no one could believe this, was very near to begin.
Merlo's headquarters is filled with goods for sale."
Experts believe that the UK's most wealthy star could damage the company to a number of millions because it has invested too much in products such as clothing and furniture, and the possibility of this is being improved.
Also, it can end a long friendship.
The three sons of Bilubi and their husband, Dan Baldwin, have been getting close enough to capture Jones and his wife for the past ten years.
Willubi had started with Cap in 2016 and was associated with it as 52-year-old Jones Cherman in March.
Baldwin's TV production company has 40 percent of the holiday couples and Jones' share.
Billy has now become the brand ambassador of M&S and will be placed in the place of Aunt McPartlin to host I'm A Celebrity's I'm A Celebrity.

Serious news 'and then we agreed'
He was laughing at them and said news media would be commenting on them, some would consider it a "national position" and would be more positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump made so much sacrifices?
Trump told his audience in the "News Anchor" Voys.
"I didn't give up anyone."
He said that after his first meeting in Singapore in June, Kim was in the second meeting, a major step was taken by Trump in the first meeting to free North Korea.
But the atoms have stopped the free conversation.
After more than three months of the June summit held in Singapore, North Korea's top political Rie Yongho told U.N. General Assembly leaders on Saturday that North Korea is not waiting for the "consistent response" to the nuclear measures launched by the U.S.
He said the U.S. has continued to pressure to maintain restrictions instead.
Their hopeful attitude was seen in the Rally talk of Trump.
They said: "We are seeking a good relationship with North Korea."
"We were going to fight North Korea.
Which would kill millions of people.
Now our relationship has become very good."
He said that their efforts to improve relationships with Kim have led to positive results - including the completion of the rocket tests, the release of prisoners, and the return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
Also, in talking about relationships with Kim, they defended their unusual attitude.
Alarming clearly to the present crowd, he said, "It's very easy to remain in position, but 10,000 people outside the country are trying to join this area, we'll have about 200 people to stop them."
In Indonesia, the tsunami and the earthquake devastated an island, hundreds of people died.
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they did not need it for the event.
Despite the loss of more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population, no national disaster was declared, as well as a condition for international aid.
Mr. Sombu said, "In some situations, unfortunately, it seemed clear to them that they were not asking for international help, so it became a little more difficult."
However, Sev The Children traveled to Palu together with a team, but it has not yet been established that workers from other countries can come here to help.
M.S.O., National Agency's spokesman, Sutopo, said that Indonesian officials were taking over the position of Palu, and they were seeing whether or not they would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts from international agencies.
Seeing such situations coming to Indonesia in Bar-Barbar, it seemed that the country is not being prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although, for the people suffering from tsunamis in Acha, they are not like the other seabed shelters.
The warning of tsunami in Palu has been reduced in the siren, no matter how harmful the warning may be, it is likely to increase the risk of life.
Although it is not the best time to travel, it is difficult to go between many islands of Indonesia.
It is always difficult to deal with the natural disasters of the labour market and the rule of property.
Earthquake sufferers are being brought to Lombok in a hospital far away from Palu and at least three days from the new disaster site.
President Joko Vidodo created a very bad basic framework for his election campaign in Indonesia and spent a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, Mr. Joe's administration has become disillusioned because the next year is going to be a choice again.
Mr. Joe is also under pressure from the media in Indonesia, where Muslim Majority members have made the religious idea more rebuff.
Over a thousand died, and ten thousand were left desolate, because they fought one with another in the streets, with bows, with bows, and with spears, and with stringed instruments.

Cromwell's statue recently became the most famous monument, again described in 'history'
It will be a model justice for the destruction of many of England’s extremist Puritan followers, who have fled.
However, the Cromwell Society reported on Mr. Creek's suggestion as "stupid" and "try to rewriting history".
The Cheerman John Goldsmith of the Crimean Society said: "In the current debate on the removal of the idols, there was absolute doubt that the image of Oliver Kramwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be marked by the image of Oliver Kramwell.
No command was given for the symbol of the English Civil War, nor did Cromwell make it.
It may be wrong that in the past century, Cromwell had abandoned his father Thomas for his works.
According to Sir William Hemo Thorochraftt, the best representation of Cromwell is a witness to the 19th century's ideas and a part of the history of an image that many people still consider to be worthy of praise.
The Sande Telegraph told Mr. Goldsmith: "Many people honor Cromwell, which may be why most people still know them as the guardian of foreign pressure in the affairs of the late 19th century.
However, they are considered to be absolutely correct, historically the subject of debate.
It is evident that since the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, our nation has developed, and the image of Kramwell has become a personal identity in which there is a clear view of the division.
Their access as Lord Protector is commendable and memorable."

According to the local press report, fourteen injured people were treated because of the display.
According to Madrid, the October 1th Social Assembly has been increasing tension in free-thinking areas for a year, but different-thinking people in Catalonia have been putting it on fire.
Votors chose a very good way for independence, although there were few people who opposed the separation.
The officials of Catalonia reported that as the police were trying to stop people from moving forward to the residential centers of the area, about 1,000 people were injured last year.
Freedom-supported groups stopped there on Friday to help the National Police to stop the demonstration.
The display was promoted, but he had to make a different decision.
The Electrical Narcyssus Termins had joined his wife in protesting, he said they did not see any chance of being free from Catalonia.
"We had our best year last year.
I had seen my mother-in-law happy, but it seems that we are now under arrest," he said.
Even after a small victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Free Alliances of Catalonia fought to maintain influence with several of its famous leaders this year, whether it is in the wake of a wake-up call or the struggle for an ongoing declaration of organization and independence.
The 42-year-old Mechanical Joan Puig, who recorded opposition to his phone to help the police, reported that the conflict between the politicians of the two sides had been halted.
He said, “This is a very difficult one.”
On Saturday, Orol Junquers, one of the nine leaders in the pre-Trail prison in Catalonia, announced that they would fight in European elections next year.
He said, "To fight European elections as hopeful is the best way to return to the people's technological values and to condemn the return that we have seen in the Spanish government.

Manga won Livingstone against Rangers from 1-0.
The first ball in Dolly's Omega assured Livingstone's victory
Livingston, according to the manager of the Brox Club, gave Rangers the chance to take responsibility for his second defeat only on March 18th.
The Dolly Menga strike made the distance that the Hüberian side of Gary Holt had made to the other part of the match.
The side of Gerard was a step away from winning the first cisan, and the next Sunday will face the leaders' hearts behind eight points.
Earlier, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna at the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the main Koch Holt is constantly winning the six-game division of Livingstone by bringing in Kenny Miler's place last month.
Liveston failed to show the wizard its game
A long time ago, the team of the Holt had to move forward, as well as, because of their great game, Rangers had a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but left behind the bullet attempt, then Alan Lithog could only stay on track after his best efforts to complete the bullet in Craig's head.
Hosts had an opportunity to play against Rangers, they knew they could put the visor on set pus in trouble.
And because of this, he got a big round.
Rangers found a free-circuit, and Livingstone opened, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked to set up Manga, who scored a touch and scored from the boxing center.
On that stage, Rangers had strengthened their position, but the home defense was wrong and the bullet was taken back to a considerable extent,
This pattern continued in the harbor for seconds, although Alfredo Morelos insisted on being safe.
Scott Pittman's shot at the Rangers' Balliper Alan McGregor stopped his feet and Lithog took the game completely off the other Livingstone.
In the Livingstone Box, the cross was constantly coming and going round, while two panels were claimed after the necklace, one of which included a Glen Middleton and the other handball.
Analyse of the 'ordinary round' of Livingstone
BBC Scotland's alsdeier Lumont was included in Tony Macaroni Erina
Livingston's extraordinary perforations and results.
For any person, they were better, they have continued to increase expectations on this growing tractor.
The way and personality of their games have been wonderfully replaced by the top-float since their return, but the most famous Holt way in which they have redesigned the team since their arrival.
There were many great players.
Captain Halket was a great player, and they did a great job, while Merga left Conner Goldson and the World behind.
Although, there was little to learn in Rangers.
The kind of fine display they've done under Gerard many times, they were less than their standard.
Their final ball was low - only once they could cut their home side open - and it was like a few weekend calls for Rangers, who kept themselves in the mid-table.

Because of the storm, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (dry areas can be useful)
The threat has become a threat in the hot spots since the storm Rosa's cut off, but it's a long way from the possibility that it's the one that can affect the remaining potential of the storm in the coming week, which has made it more difficult to catch up.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service announced that the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with South-West Arizona and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, were threatened with rapid flooding.
It is expected that the sun will rise on the Monday afternoon, and the sun will go out straight from its full moon.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted, "Since 1950, within 200 miles of Phoenix, ten hot-rolled cycles have maintained the situation of a hot-rolled storm or indisputable!
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the storm Azed border."
In recent years, the National Ukrainian Center model has estimated that there may be 2 to 4 inches of rain in Arizona’s Mongol Rim, as well as 6 inches of rain.
With Central Rockies and Great Basin, there is a chance of rain from 1 to 2 inches in other parts of the Southwest along with Saat Desert, as well as a chance of 4 inches in.
Outside of the briers and thorns of the desert, there is a very little rain; for it is dry in this place.
Although the storm has become a very serious concern, the drought has now become a state of drought in the south-west, which makes rain much more profitable.
According to the U.S. Draft Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona's area is too dry, the second highest level is dry," said the weather.com report.
First of all, the storm will run from the California island of Rosa Mexico.
On Sunday morning, the maximum wind speed of the storm Rosa was 85 miles per hour, it was 385 miles south of Eugenia, Mexico and is now moving from 12 miles per hour to the north.
This storm is now in the cool water of the peaceful region, which is diminishing its power.
Thus, it is hoped that by the power of a hot storm, the situation in Mexico may arise on Monday afternoon or in the evening.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rain may increase the risk of flooding.
According to the report of "weather.com", "This is expected to rain from the coast of California in the north-west Sonora from 3 to 6 inches, as well as 10 inches of rain."
Then Rosa will be a hot storm on Tuesday morning, before reaching the northern border of Arizona, in all Mexico, and then on Tuesday, to the south of Arizona and South Utah.
The National Hurricane Center said, "Rosa or its remaining parts are at the greatest risk of California, the North-West Sonora, and the US.
It is estimated that these rains are the result of the rapid floods and floods in the deserts, and that the population is threatened by floods in the mountainous regions.

The earthquakes in Indonesia, hundreds of people dying from tsunamis, are increasing the number of deaths
On Saturday, the authorities reported that when a huge earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulavis, high tides started to rise and at least 384 people died.
On Friday, a holiday was held on the beach of Palu, where hundreds gathered, after a night of six feet (18 ft) high waves rose, and it destroyed many people and destroyed everything around them.
Sunami 7.5 came after the earthquake.
In a briefing in Jakarta, Indonesia's environmental impact was reported by Professor Sutopo Privo Nagoroho of the News Agency, who said, "When the tsunami hit, the people in the middle of the day were in their activities and were not in a state of emergency and were arrested in it."
Núgroho said, "Sunami didn't just become the cause of people's death, but it also dragged cars, logos and houses to the ground, and before attacking the seabed, Sunami traveled 800 km per hour (497 miles per hour) from the open sea.
He said that some people would climb up the trees to save themselves.
16,700 people were expelled from the 24 centers of Palu.
The pictures from the airship posted by the Djaster Agency showed that many buildings and shops have been damaged, the bridges have turned and collapsed, and a museum is surrounded by water.
And it came to pass on the sabbath, that there went out a stone to be set against the wall of the city of refuge.
2.4 million people in the area have experienced the ongoing earthquake.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPTT) said in his report that the energy capacity of the heavy earthquake that hit Hiroshima in the Second World War was about 200 times higher than that of the nuclear bomb.
It said that the area of the city of Busa on the edge of a long, narrow valley could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nagroho explained in detail that it was "very terrible" and that it caused thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels to collapse.
He said that some people's corpses had been captured in the constructions of shelters, and 540 people were injured in it, while 29 people have not been found.
Negroho explained that the area near the center of the earthquake is likely to be too large to be damaged, 300 kilometres (90 miles) to the north of Palu, near the center of the earthquake.
Negroho reported that in the mountains the communication system was "disgustingly damaged".
In a statement, Red Cross reported that more than 300,000 people were living here and that its workers and volunteers were traveling to affected areas.
It says, "It is a painful event before, but it may be even more terrible."
On Saturday, the Agency pointed out that if there was to be a tsunami in Palu, why the information was not given before, although the authorities indicated that the warning was to be issued but the waves had already arrived.
A person made some videos and posted them on social media, showing that the situation on the top floor of the building was being heard by people on the street below, and a warning can be given.
Within a few minutes, a lot of water came out of the middle and the buildings and cars were drawn with them.
Reuters was not able to authenticate quickly.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a problem of electricity in Palu, and the lines of communication were cut, making it difficult to combine rescue efforts for the authorities.
With the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities have begun sending Cargo flights, the authorities have indicated that people still need to be removed and that they need to meet other needs with food.
Airport of the city is only reopened for relief efforts and will be closed in October.
The president of the exit centres in Palu was going to do Yoko Vidodo on Sunday.
In Indonesia, the number of people who died because of the tsunami has increased by more than 800.
It's very horrible.
Mr. Dossebah said that the World Vigen workers in Dongagala were trying to secure Palu City, the workers were building and staying in their office halls, and they saw the damage in their eyes.
They said: "Now has he seen (this) how many (his) houses lie desolate."
It's very horrible.
Aid groups began to bring relief supplies seriously, some people complained that special specialist foreign aid workers are being banned from entering the palace.
According to Indonesia's rules, wealth, equipment and workers can only be accepted when the declaration of the disaster area is made as a national disaster area.
But it's not done yet.
In Indonesia, Red Cross's spokesman, Orlia Aryani, said, "This disaster is still on the ground level."
"After the government says it's right, it's a national disaster, so we can include international relief workers in the rescue work, but it hasn't happened yet."
On Friday, after the earthquake and the second night of the tsunami, the people whose friends and family members had not met in Palu hoped that their favorite miracles would be found as if natural disasters were coming.
It was found on Saturday that a little boy was trapped in Cever.
The rescuer took a woman out of the cave on Sunday, and her child was caught in the cave two days.
Koch Gandon Subando of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team trained two Asian game paragliders to identify the missing people, dedicated to it from the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
The M.D. was also among the people who were trapped in Roa Roa Hotel with their students.
He said, "I'm also emotionally depressed as a top in the paragliding field."
Mr. Gander said that just after the news of Roa Roa Hotel crash, the paragliding community began its work, they sent messages to Palu competitors participating in the festival through WhatsApp.
However, their message does not show a blue sign on it, but only a grey sign on it.
They said, "I think the messengers have not come to the people."

AMELO, in Mexico, swore not to use the army against civilians
After 50 years of the country's death penalty against students, Mexican President Andres Manual Lopez Obredor will never use this sworn food force for non-military citizens.
In Teltelko Plaza on Saturday, Lopez Obredor promised that "military force will never be used to pressure Mexicans."

The U.S. flag to double the flag given for I.I.
Google, Microsoft, and Apple have reduced the number of interns and AI's employees, Kai-fu Lee, because China is more active in artificial intelligence, so the U.S. should double the cost of research in this area.
After several actions by the U.S. government, the AI has commented, they also said that there is a lack of a comprehensive OAB strategy in the U.S.
Meanwhile, last year China launched a plan: its goal is to reach the AI 1 in 2030.
Lee said, "It's a good start to double the AI search budget, look at all other countries, so the US is behind this, and we're trying to achieve the next AI."
This week, in a witness to CNBC, Lee said, "simplification of the fund may double the likelihood that the next major availability of the AI will be in the U.S.."
Lee, whose book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Huton Mifflin Harcourt, Cio of Cinoloss, one of China's best AIA companies, is an intruder of Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mailen University had worked on an A.I. system that left U.S.-most-ranking Othelo player far behind, and later they were appointed president of Microsoft Research at Executive and in the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee explained the technical capabilities of the last U.S. government, which included the challenges associated with the robots of the Defense Edward Research Projects Agency, and said who will be the next government that will recognize the next telescope.
Lee explained that U.S. researchers often face many difficulties in getting government help.
Lee said, "It's not Chinese that removes academic leaders, it's a corporate."
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technical companies have appointed Duggages from University to work on AI.
Lee explained that by changing the immigration policy, the U.S. can help in its efforts.
He said, "My account should have permission to hack into the A.I. on my own."
In July 2017, the State Council of China launched its NEXT generation artificial intelligence development plan.
Lee said, "The National Nuclear Science Foundation of China provides financial contributions to researchers from the United States, but the quality of teaching in China is not very good.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Defense Department opened a Joint Architectural Intelligence Center, whose goal is to include industry and students' participants, and White House announced the creation of a Selection Committee for Architectural Intelligence.
In addition, this month DRAP launched a first in the name of AI Next, which referred to 2 billion dollars' contribution.
For NSF, it is now more than $100 million a year in the AI survey.
Meanwhile, U.S. law has been made that the requirement to make a National Security Commission for Artificative Intelligence will be ignored for months.
Macedonians voted that the country’s name will be changed
On Sunday, people in Macedonia voted to replace the country with "Republic of North Macedonia", or "Republic of North Macedonia", which is a work that will resolve the old conflict with Greece for decades, which has led to the banning of its membership in the European Union and NATO.
There is also a region in Greece called Macedonia, which is said to have its northern neighbor's name on its territory, with two names for the same claim and already included in NATO and the European Union.
Both governments have divided on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents opposed it and said that changing the name of Macedonia would weaken the ethnic identity of the many people living in Slavic.
President George Ivanov said that they would not vote in the community and expel the campaign, they have doubted that at least 50 percent of the votes required for this vote will be valid.
The question on the Voting Ballet will be written: "Do you accept the agreement with Greece for the membership of NATO and Eu."
Prime Minister Zoran Zew told supporters associated with the change in the name of Saat that it is necessary to join such institutions as Eu and Nato for Macedonia, which is one of the countries that have emerged from Yugoslavia.
79-year-old Olivera Georgizwska, who lives in Skopje, said, "Today I have come to vote for the country's future, this future is for young people in Macedonia, which will allow them to live freely in the shadow of Jehu because it means we all have a secure life."
Although it is not legally emphasized, most members of the parliament say they will work according to the voting results to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is needed to change the name in the constitution.
According to the State Election Commission, no information on irregularities was received by 1 a.m.
Although, when the last secular election was held in 2016, the vote was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent, with 66 percent registered thinkers voting.
A 62-year-old thinker in the capital, Skopje, told Gojo Tanevski, "I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe."
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zev gave his wife, Zorika, and his son Dosko, a vote to change the name of the country in Macedonia to include the country's name in NATO and the European Union on 30 September, 2018.
54-year-old Vladimir Coverdarkov, who lived in front of the council, was preparing a small-scale stage and was putting courses in front of those who opposed this vote.
Kwaderkov said, "We need to join NATO and Jehu, but we want to be included in this, not by reason of any misunderstanding."
"Our country must be poor, but we also have our own dignity.
If they don't want us to sign up for Macedonia, there's nothing we can do, we can join other countries like China and Russia as part of Euro-Asia."
Prime Minister Zev said that getting membership in NATO would make Macedonia a very important contribution, which is more than 20 per cent of the unemployment rate.
After putting his vote, Zev said, "I think there will be a lot more positive voting because we agree to connect more than 80 percent of our citizens to Eu and Nato."
He said that the result of "yes" would be "the confirmation of our future."
Last Monday, the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia announced that 30 to 43 percent of the votes in the poll will be cast.
On Sunday, the other news from the Macedonian telema TV revealed that 57 percent of the people are planning to vote.
Among them, 70 percent agree to do so.
More than 50 percent of voting is necessary to succeed.
If voting fails, the policies of the Western Government, which will take place in May last year, will be the first serious challenge.

The game against Rockys is a game that the emperor wants to win.

Thrump Rays in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of the Republican Moment in the Middle Term Election, the president briefed Brett Kwanwaga on the situation surrounding his Supreme Court.
"All the work we have done will be done in November.
Only five weeks have left for the most important choice of our lives.
He said, "This is a big choice - I'm not in it, but I'm in it, because I'm fighting for all the great hopers."
Trup added, "You can look at this very awful group of democrats, you can see all the things that's happening right now.
In addition, they're trying to use other necessary tools, which you know is useless and useless.
They don't care who's sick, who's capable of it, they just want power and control, but we won't let it happen."
He said the Democratic campaign is to "put an end to opposition and ban".
They said, "In addition to that, you can see what happened in the last four days, you've seen the wrath of the Democrat, and you've seen it. They're both mean and bad."
They refer to the Senate Judicial Committee as Democratic Sen. Diane named Feynstein, whose performances were marked by praise.
"Remember his answer?
Have you cleared the document?
What.
No, no, I'm waiting for the thing -- the body language was really bad -- the bad body language I saw for the first time."
Work is no longer a Broad Church.
It is not fitting for those who say what is in their hearts.
When my people were voting to elect me, it was very surprising to me.
Finally, I'm the newest among the workers who have lost a lot of importance -- we can't say all of our thoughts.
My colleague, John Ryan, was also here because he too had a voice for immortality.
In my case, Sensor Mossan denounced me for inconsistency with Jeremy Corbin.
At the importance of the Econnomic Policy, national security, there were similar problems in Europe, such as V Yong or Mac, which was not consistent with Jeremy's senior leaders.
For the Notingham East Lab meeting, it was said on Friday, "We want everything to be included in the meeting and it's profitable."
During my eight years as a local lab, I saw most of the same Freddie Knight GC meeting.
Unfortunately, today there is no agreement in many meetings, and it is promised that the politics of "the merciful and the poor" is actually forgotten here, too.
It is clear that if the views in the lab party are different, they are not dependent and it is decided for every thought that this party is eligible for leadership.
Immediately after Jeremy's leadership began here, for whom I had previously thought they had political opinions, they began to expect me to return to my words and work on the positions I could never agree with, whether it was national security or the single market of Eu.
Whenever I raise my voice to the public -- and it really doesn't matter what I said -- I get to see bad words on social media, it's over-recorded, the politics of the center is being challenged, and I'm told I'm not eligible for a lab party.
Besides, he's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more critical than some of my colleagues because my comments are linked to politics.
I know how to do business, and I'm dedicated to partners who always face sexual or ethnic abuse, but don't hesitate to raise their voices.
In today's political age, there are several discouraging aspects, one of which is how to make abuse levels normal.
Last week Jeremy Corbin claimed that the lab party needs to promote the culture of intolerance.
In fact, we're not staying in the Broad Church now and the changes that are going to take place in the section role of "untrust" have been very small.
In the past two years, a number of people advised me and asked me to remain silent, not to talk more, and then I said, "I will obey."
But, I didn't come into politics for it.
32 years ago, when I was connected to a school as a student, I was encouraged to oppose the Thacher government, I was told to leave my school wide room completely, I asked people who needed the best public services -- whether it was as a local parliament or as a government minister.
I never hid any of my politics, along with the politics of the last election.
There is no one in the Notingham East who is in doubt about my position of policy and who is inconspicuous about my current leadership.
I would like to say to all those who have invited the proposal on Friday that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that would damage our public services, I do not understand my time and energy to demonstrate my honesty for the lab party.
But, in fact, I have a message that's not for the Notiningham Momentum, it's for my supporters, whether they're a lab member or not: I'm proud of the fact that I'm serving you and I promise I can't create any kind of austerity or political effort in my work, I'm only interested in things that you're in.

IR 38 - 17 Melrose: Reach the Irrigated Iron Top
Two recent efforts can have an impact on the final outcome, but there is no doubt that the Air Tenant Prime Minister was entitled to win this best entertainment match.
Now they're only top on the table of ten unrestricted sides.
Finally, their defense was better, they found as many good opportunities as they could, which led home team to move forward and gave Coch Peter Mordecai the chance to be happy.
They said, "We have tested our game completely, and we are still in the wrong, so it makes me happy."
Robin Kristie of Melrose said: "His credit goes to Iron, who lost their opportunity as much as possible."
The effort made by Grant Anderson on the 14th minute led Frasier Klimo to face the ice, but the player Rory Hughes of Scotland was given a yellow card for the game, which enabled Melrose to score and Jason Baggen to make a very difficult effort.
With the help of the first panel from Haf-Time, Klimo increased the ice, swung around and then tried to join the 17-5 match for the break.
But Melrose was better off in the harbor, and Patrick Anderson's effort turned Baggot into a ball, which reduced the five points of Levi's.
After that, Ruridha Nott suffered a serious injury, causing the game to be stopped, they were drawn, and after the game began, the iron advanced and tried by Stafford McDowal, who changed the game into a ball.
At the time, Captain Blair McFarson of the Iron Team had found the ice card, and then Melrose gave him an extra man Bruce Calvin, who failed to kill him because of a lot of pressure at the end of the game.
Although the host team was behind, and when Struen Hishinson got his credit card for facing Billa Ball's piano line-out climo, McFarson pushed the iron forward.
After sending Flander Henry away from David Armstrong's boxing kite and the fifth attempt on home side, Klimo changed it into a round, as they could when the game began again.
The stars of the game are still looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Star Ford Kern of the game is still looking for a way to go to the Hospitality Industry, some time before they learned that they had been selected to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old Jack is connected to George's famous B.C. show, where they work writing, and have long been accompanying the comic party Greg Hemfil.
Both have reported that the coming nine Sires will have their final Sires in the world, and it seems that they are planning on what to do with Kernan after Craigland.
Based on the official record list, they're the director of the Edriftmore Limited.
Akter refused to comment on the story, but the source of a Scotch-san showed that they wanted to connect to a "big restaurant trade" located in Kirnon Glasgow.
'Our authority on the sea': Land-based Bolivia hopes to reopen the way for the court peace
Army-Navik La Paz is playing on a large scale in the Nival Head Quartz.
The Osian-Blue flag is being flagged on government buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, there's a nascent of the Nausena Bas: "We have authority over the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
In the 19th century, Bolivia is still eager to find its land in a terrible struggle for land - they want to reclaim their address in the Pacific.
Now they hope that decades ago they will be able to re-establish their Bolivian land, because it is awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice after five years of reflection.
The diplomat Roberto Kalazila of Bolivia said, "Bolivia now has a lot of zeal, there is a sense of unity and peace, and there will be a positive result of the hope of the people here."
Many people in Bolivia will see the great decision of ICJ on a large screen throughout the country, hoping that the decision of Heg will be on the side of the Bolivian court - which has been talking for decades - that Chile has been forced to return to the country of Bolivia to the sea by means of conversation.
The best president of Bolivia, Ivo Morelas, who is going to face a controversial challenge in the next year's election, has also been able to do this on Monday.
They said, "We are near at sea, in peace."
However, some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in favour of Bolivia -- and if the decision does, there will be plenty of conditions.
The United Nations Office in the Netherlands does not have the right to recognise Chile's territory, and it has determined that the likely results of the news will not be determined.
In the International Court of Justice, Chile's expert Pas Zret said that the ICJ's decision would come six months after the last conversation, which indicated that the case was "not complicated".
In addition, it seems different from the conditions of Bolivia, over the past four years, that it can return to the old state.
Jarret said, "The point of access to the sea is blocked by the current government of Bolivia."
He suggested that Moralese's arguments have ended Chile's remaining wishful thinking.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk on some conditions, but this time it will be very difficult to talk.
Since 1962, the ambassadors of both countries have not lived in each other's countries.
President Edward Rodríguez Welltze, former representative of Bolivia in Heg, has denied that the court's decision was a little faster.
He said that Monday would be "a better opportunity for Bolivia to open the way for new relations with Chile" and that it would be "an opportunity to end 139-year-old disagreements on mutual merits".
Kalizila has accused Morales - still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America - of politics on the sea problem.
They said, “Bolivia will never be able to return to her power to achieve peace.”
"The decision is a chance to know what we had to do in the past."
North Korea has said nuclear surveillance will not be stopped until it trusts America
Foreign Minister Rei Yong of North Korea said that their nation would not destroy its bomber until it had trusted in Washington.
On Saturday, Rei gave a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
They said to the United States, "Let him fulfill the vows made to the leaders of other countries at the summit in Singapore."
He noted that the U.S. Secretary Mike Pompio of the State seems to be relaunching the nuclear power plant in Kim Jong, North Korea, more than three months after the promises made in Singapore.
Rei said it's the "pipe drama" that would be considered North Losing the bans and US violence to declare the Korean war to be over.
The Washington Pyongyang is warned of the agreement of the major disarmament campaign already taking place without the announcement of the Washington Pyongyang.
Kim and US president Donald Trump want another summit.
However, it is completely questionable that Pyongyang nuclear bomb monitoring is serious because they do not want to put the country's security in danger.
The next month, Kim-Tramp is planning to go to Pompeo Pyongyang to prepare for the second summit.
In the Paris fashion show, showcases for a number of new design heads for your nearby high street
If you need to increase your hat collection or completely protect your head from sunlight, you don't need to wait much longer.
Valentino and Thom Brown both designers have built a series of better headviews for their SS19 collection at Runve, showing in the famous Paris Fashion Viking style.
Best useful hats are designed to protect from the heat of this year and these designers have sent their beautiful creation to show.
The best hats made by Valentino were very large, he was decorated with wings like the wide brim which had been wrapped around the head of the model.
The watermelon hats, the viscerd hats and the pinapple design hats that were made in the second side accessible were included - but they are not designed to protect your head from cold.
Thom Brown also showed special design cubes - and their use can only be made in time for Halloween.
Many colourless faces were surprised to see people with more hunky readings than the High Coucher.
In one creation, every type of equipment for the Scoba Diving included snowballs and showers, while in the other creation, icecream was seen as a cone of design.
Besides, if you've seen a bigger fashion -- you're a counselor.
Those who see style are expected to be able to quickly access the best collection in the best shops around you.
Very large sized hats will meet the 'La Bomba' design hall, with two-foot wide Brym Stra Hats from Rihana to Emily Ratazkovski.
The cold label behind the best effective hat was very beautiful, with a second creation posted on social media - a model showing the swimming suit on the bag in the middle of the street.
Bernt Orange Rafia Bag Rafia Fringing was tried and placed in white leather handle, it was the best attraction of the SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week in La Rivera Jaquims.
Fascist Celibacy Luke Armitage said to E.F.E., 'I hope that a big hot for the coming heat will soon be in the middle of the bag stores -- because designers have been so impressed by this that it will be difficult to ignore the great-size accessory.'
John Edward: Language skills are needed for people from foreign countries
Scotland's private school has been looking at the track record of better education, and since 2018 it has continued to provide better testing results that strengthen personal and collective success in games, art, music and other community efforts.
More than 30,000 students in the whole of Scotland are associated with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCAs), who are trying to provide their students and participants with the best service in their leadership.
The goal of private schools is to prepare students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places are benefiting foreign citizens.
As an implementation sector that can create and apply school texts, we see that modern languages in schools continue to be chosen as a popular and desirable subject option.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone who understands the language, you become better for him.
If you speak with him in his tongue, his speech will please you.
When we want to make a relationship and trust people from other countries, we think we can trust English more.
In the recent results of this year's trial, we can see that languages with the highest rates in private schools are the highest in the league table.
68% of them are students who have received the highest grade A in foreign languages.
72 percent of students received the highest grade A in the Mediterranean language, while 72 percent of students received the highest grade A in the German language, 69 percent in the French language, and 63 percent in the Spanish language.
This shows that Scotland’s private school is working in foreign languages that will provide important skills for children and young people who will need them in the future.
Languages are now included in the text of private schools as an alternative subject and in other things, as is the subject of STSMs (scientific, industrial, engineering and mathematics).
The U.K. Commission for Implementation and Skills in 2014 found that the New Yorkers fought hard enough to appoint unemployed workers, with 17 per cent expected to have fewer language skills.
Therefore, young people need more language skills to prepare for their future career.
Due to the most possible opportunities available in the language, these skills are needed to work anywhere in the world.
No choice for careers, if people have learned another language, such skills will benefit them in the future.
If you're able to talk to foreign people directly, you'll get ahead of yourself in the competition because you're a multilingual person.
In 2013, more than 4,000 British adults fled to YouTube, according to which 75 percent did not speak enough in any foreign language, and only French was the only language that would be spoken by 15 percent and that would be the only language to reach a double figure.
That is why today children need to be involved in learning the language.
Knowing a number of languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children the best opportunity to search for the right journalists.
Languages taught in every school in Scotland will be different.
There are many schools that will focus on more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages whose view is towards 2020 and which are considered the most important for the Yukon, for example, Madrid or Japan.
Even if your child is interested in learning any language, they will always be able to choose the language in private schools and they will also find staff who are experts in this area.
Scotland's private school is dedicated to providing education that will prepare children for the future and provide them with the necessary skills for their future success.
The global business environment cannot yet be exploited by the fact that language learning in the country is essential for the future, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be accepted as "international communication skills".
The choice of this option, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland will continue to be given by private schools.
It needs to be done well.
John Edward, director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
On Sunday in San Diego, Lebron began to be part of the lakes
Now there's going to be an end to the waiting hours for the fans of LeBron James because they're going to play their first match for Los Angeles Lacquer very soon.
Luke Walton of Lechers has announced that James has been selected as Pressen Opper to play against the Denver Negates on Sunday in San Diego.
But, how many minutes will they play it is still to be determined.
"They'll play at least one minute and more, 48 minutes."
The lecturer Mike Trudelle tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After the start of this week's study, six games from James Leckers were asked about their plans for the Precisean Schedule.
He said, "I don't need to be prepared for the Pressen game at this stage of my career."
Thrump train in West Virginia, YouTube channel
In West Virginia, Willing, President Donald Trump played a lot of games for the campaign tonight.
The following week, Trump has set up five and a series of rails, including Tennessee and Egypt, and several other suitable locations.
With the suspension of the vote specified in your election to the position of the Supreme Court, the trumpet target needs to help for the upcoming mid-term election because it is expected to leave Congress control when the vote is counted in November.
In West Virginia, when will the night trumpet be held today, and how will you view it online?
On Saturday, 29 September, 2018, the time for the trip to West Virginia has been set for 7 evenings ET.
You can see the rolling on-line of the drums in West Virginia by live stream on YouTube.
The Supreme Court's hopeful Brett Kwanwagh can give a trump speech this week, because of the charges against young Kwanwagh, the confirmation of the seat vote expected for one week has been blocked during the FIT's investigation.
However, the main objective of this tense environment of the rails is to help the Republic cope with the elections in November.
According to Reuters, President Trump said during the campaign, "The goal of these five railways next week is to ensure that they are able to protect and increase their dignity as volunteers and supporters in the centuries to come."
According to Reuters, the speaker who was removed from the trumpet campaign said, "Congratulation control has become so necessary for their agenda that the president will only travel to the states where our campaign will be very busy.
According to West Virginia Metro News, "Viling's Vasbanko in Erina can be brought to the attention of the supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania by tonight's radio."
It will be the second time of Saturday last month when Trump has travelled to West Virginia, they received more than 40 per cent in 2016.
The hopeful supporters of the West Virginia Republican Senate are coming forward to try to help Patrick Morris.
According to Reuters, political scientist Simon Hender from West Virginia University said, "If the attempt to increase Morris in the election is to make the president, it is not a good sign for them."
Reader Cup 2018: Team USA showed a willingness to resist so that hopes of living in India Singles can be maintained
After three consecutive sessions, Saturday afternoon at the fourth session will be the result of what is going to happen in this rider's cup.
Timed out is a completely new puzzle for players, but when player moves forward and is trusted, it cannot be estimated in such contests.
What, then, will they now say about this moment?
"They had six points of increase that have now been four, so I think we'll have to increase our speed a little."
Certainly, Europe benefited, and the game took 12 points and moved forward from four points.
According to Speith, the Americans think they have a few opportunities and have a lot to encourage, not only from the spat form but also from the form of Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both got three out of their game.
The game's the best in the game.
As their game progressed, the people excitedly played strong strings, and when they and Thomas went two and a half points down, four al-Squares were important to complete.
Because of their postage, their team came to the 15th position with the same screen, the sort that tells you you don't think American team out of it.
He said, "You've got a great game to play and you've got to pay attention to that victory."
That's what all the players who are out of the game say.
18 holes to make a mark.
In the last two days, there are only two players who have scored more than Speithe and Thomas, whose names are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitewood, who are making a new history in the Reader Cup.
Europe's different styles, but the best team has got four points in four and the next.
Saturday afternoon there was a single couple who didn't shoot a tree, but they stayed away from the tree from Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning at nine o'clock in the morning.
On Sunday, he found the way to get the run and the run in this strong crowd and this strong crowd like the bet players, and there was no player who could change the possible victory of the European team so that it would be the first sunset of the Golf Nation compared to Flitewood or Molinary.
Well, let's both be different in different ways.
Although, Europe's dignity is being said a long time ago.
Baba Passen and Web Simpson made it a little easier for Hiro Sergio Garsia in the morning, while their partner was made with Alex Norren.
A tree in front of No.D. and spaniard and Swed, they had never reached here before.
Although, on Sunday, there was no one to help you get to your house.
Forball and Forsam were very good because the interaction between the peering was much better, they advised that they don't need advice and are well-known for changing the strategy.
As a team, Europe has played a great deal and has grown significantly in the last day, but this forum session also showed that the team has the ability to cope with the U.S. that is questionable, especially in the stateside.
Europe increased 10-6 on the last day of the Reader Cup
On Saturday, the 10-6 forball and forsom match on the United States will benefit Europe in a good way after the end of the Reader Cup.
The best couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have increased the Tiger Woods fighting with two winnings so that they can move ahead with their match from four points of the Golf National.
Two years ago, Thomas Bejorn, in Heseltine, was caught in the European South Morning Forebol because of the mesiphering of the American side, which led to an increase of 3-1 in the series.
U.S. showed more resistance in Forsam winning in two matches, but they couldn't avoid losing.
Jim Furick's side needs eight points in the 12 single match on Sunday to maintain the victory of Trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European stopover to win four points, while he and Molinery started with "Molywood" after the sensational weekend, they are the second pair that wins their first four points in the history of the Rider Cup.
After losing Woods and Patrick Read in Forball, they lost the best players Woods and the Americas to lose the Braison Deshambu before showing up at 5 and 4 points.
On Saturday, the Woods that are going ahead with two matches showed their best performance, but now they have faced 19 defeats in their 29th match and seventh match in Forball and Forsam.
In the rest of the morning, Justin Roosevelt came back to Forsam with his party Henrik Stansen, and one of the world's players, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copek, lost 2-1.
Although Plagent in the South West of Paris, Brice had no break in Europe.
The top player, Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who won three matches on Saturday, established benchmarks for the United States.
They won a 2-1 victory at the Spanish John Reham and Ian Polter in Forbol and sent Pauls and Rory Mcleroi back to the first two halls with 4-3.
In the history of the Reader Cup, it was only twice when a team came back from a single match to get four points, although the need for the side of the Furik attracted all the attention in traffic.
Although, for two days after being a second-best, the counter-attack that happens on Sunday will be as different from their old game.
North Korea said that saying 'no way' would only be a party that could not be trusted
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said that the United Nations continued on Saturday to maintain restrictions that depended on their lack of faith in United States and did not show any way in which the country would only allow itself to monitor nuclear bombs.
Rey Yong Ho said in the Annual General Assembly of the World Body that last year North Korea had developed a number of ways that were linked to "significant positive approaches", such as stopping the testing of nuclear bombs and missiles, destroying the testing site of nuclear bombs, and promising not to advance the work of nuclear weapons and nuclear industry.
They said, "We did not find any answer to that from America."
"There will be no faith in our national security without trusting the U.S. in any way, and there's no way in situations like this that we're going to start the extermination of each other."
While Rei reiterated that the claims made by North Korea are about the "practice" of Washington, which will gradually benefit North Korea, it is quite clear from their statements that this mutual disarmament cannot be abandoned by only one party because Pyongyang has already done so.
For the first time in June 12 serving in Singapore, the U.S. President and North Korea’s leader, Rei, at the summit conference, sponsored by Kim Jong on and Donald Trup, at which time Kim became accustomed to working in the direction of “the elimination of Korean legislation” while Trup promised the security of North Korea.
North Korea is calling for an official end to the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States says Pyongyang should first stop making his nuclear weapon.
Washington has also opposed the call to end severe international restrictions on North Korea.
Rei said, "The U.S. has put emphasis on disarmament first and has raised the level of bans so that he can achieve his goal strongly, and also, he has also succeeded in "declaring the end of the war."
"The arrest can bend us, the idea is a pipe dream of people who are ignoring us.
But the fact is that our confidence in the continuous ban is diminishing."
Rei did not discuss the plan of another summit between Kim and Trump, he said the U.S. leader had announced last week the beauty of the United Nations.
Instead, the minister discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Man Jain in the last five months, saying, "If South Korea is a party to this problem of disarmament and the U.S. is not, then the elimination of Korean legislation will not be part of such an violence."
Still, Rei's speech was very different from last year's speech when he said about the U.N. National Assembly that it was not easy to target the U.S. Menland after the "Mill President" tromp on the Suside mission.
In this year's United Nessance, North Korea, which threatened to "completely destroy", had praised the courage of the Qims to be taken into exile, but said that it still has to do a lot of work and the ban will continue until North Korea is eliminated.
On Wednesday, Trump told them they had no time limit for it, "If it takes two years, three years, or five years, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are arguing that Pyongyang should be awarded for the steps to be taken by the UN Security Council.
Although the U.S. Secretary Mike Pompio of the State told the U.N. Security Council: "The prohibition of the Security Council should continue until we realize that without any failure we are completely, ultimately and properly decommissioned."
The Security Council has extended the ban on North Korea in 2006 with full agreement to gather funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Rei at the U.N. General Assembly and then told them that they would return to another summit next month.
Pompeii has already taken North Korea three times this year, but their last trip has not been great.
They went back to Pyongyang in July and said that the work was progressing, only within a few hours North Korea denounced them for "Gangster-like requests".
North Korea decided to destroy the missile site this month, and if the United States adopts "the Global Facility", it will also destroy the nuclear area.
He told them Kim had promised them "the best solution", they were calling for security to take the trump plan in Singapore, and they moved forward to establish a common relationship with Washington.
Hardy's students are training enough for a restful job
The Harvard University has launched a new course this year, which is designed for all of its entrants who want to find more and more comfortable in combating the art of art in an increasing study of caffeine-injection through 'al-niters'.
The world number of students at a university often has no choice when such normal things come to give themselves a rest.
At Harvard Medical School, Professors of Sleep Medicine and Brigham and Dr. Charles Keissler of Vimas Hospital have developed a course that they believe is the first of their kind in the U.S.
After talking about the low impact of sleep during education, they decided to start this course.
They told The Telegraph, 'A girl came to me at the end of the year, and she said, 'Why do I say this every time I go to the next year'?
He said, "No one has told him about the meaning of sleep - which I was concerned about."
For the first time this year, students will learn how important the good practice of gold is in the course of education and education and in the field of ethics will be, in addition to improving their general health.
Executive Director Paul Barrera of Health Services at Harvard Medical School, Professor of Mentality and University, explained that students do not sleep sufficiently every week for which the University decided to start this course.
An interactive task series has been included in the course for hours.
In one section, a directory room will be a picture, where students will click on coffee cups, covers, trainers and books to tell what will impact on caffeine and light and how the lack of sleep affects the athletic performance, as well as the importance of gold in the diary.
In the second section, the participants will be told that the risk of stroke, depression, and cancer may increase from lack of sleep.
A map of the interactive icon campus will be shown, and participants will be encouraged to think about their daily diary.
Professor Gessler said, "We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they should have information about this -- just as smoking has information about the health effects of smoking."
He said that there is still a culture of pride on 'all night reading', the growing pressure on modern technology and students means that they need less gold, which has become a growing problem.
You sleep well enough or not, making sure it's like the students' 'secret weapons', so they can cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, they said -- it saves them from the effects of falling asleep because their brains keep thinking about hunger that they get hungry all the time.
The 19-year-old Raymond So of California studying chemical and physical biology helped Professor Jessler to develop a course, and in the last year, Harvard completed his last year's class of iron.
He reported that they were awake because of the course and were inspired by the campus-wide course.
In the future, they hope that all postgraduate students will be required to complete this course before joining the competition agency.
PRO JESSLER suggested that students should consider setting alarms before gold, as well as determining when they should wake up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effect of the Blue Light that can put on them a lot more Sardinian than sleep problems.
Levinston's Rangers 1 - 0: Manga turned against Gerard
As a result of Dolly Manga's strike, Rangers had to face another challenge in the match, the winner of the 1-0 of Livingstone's victory was placed on the wrong side of Steven Garard.
In February, after winning 4-1 in St. Johnston, Hebro Side was looking for their first win, but Gary Holt's team encouraged Garard to become second-rate manager in 18 games, so that the Leader Hearts of the Landbrox Prime Minister could be expelled with eight points.
In the past half-time, it was not possible to strike for seven minutes and then match the line-up short of Rangers.
Although Rangers have now fallen into rankings and have reached six places, Livingstone has reached third place and is behind only Hebrew due to the overall difference.
In addition, after clearly throwing the object on the other side of the object, the game may be more troublesome than the loss of the head of Linsman Calum Spence.
The last eight changes to the side of Gerard led to an opportunity for ice to go to the semi-finals of the Betfried Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was included in the same book 11 that took one point of the hearts last week and the bird team was disturbed at every turn by how well they played.
Rangers could win the match, but Livingstone played better than them.
When he first let-off sent Scott Petman to Allen McGregor's ball, they should only have given him a two-minute time, but Midfielder missed the big opportunity he got.
In DDP, when Kegan Jacques released, it went to Captain Craig's hatchet, but at the back post, their defensive partner, Alan Lithgo, could only spread the stable.
Rangers got control, but they trusted them more than they expected in the Final Thread than they trusted in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly experienced that they had to place a panel on the Quartet-Over Mark because they and Steven Loles were intertwined, but reportedly Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian appeal.
Rangers saved two shots on the target in the Forst-Hoff, but took the previous Ibro ballchip to confront the strokes of the head of the Lasanna colibeli and the Twi Oves in Asia.
Although, in the 34th minute, life's open run of the game could go against, but no one can deny that they are the only ones responsible for this graph.
After that, the best player in the Rangers DP couldn't cover Jacob.
When the decon galagher passed Scott Robinson to ball, Scott Arfield showed no interest in it, Scott Robinson held the peace to pick up Manga for simple finish.
When Gerard swapped Callibel for Ryan Kent and moved to show immediate effects by slotting through the jungle in Morelos, they had broken, but did block their line running well.
However, Livingstone showed the game as much as they could really enjoy the game as they could, they swung the Long Ball with Lithog and halkett.
In the final stage, the side of the hold could increase their growth, but before being welded from the corner by Lithgov, McGregor effectively stopped Jacobs from studying up.
Rangers called Glen Middleton as an option, they nailed another lat for the panel because they were upset with Jacobs, but Thompson did not let them succeed again.
Almanac: Excavator of the Gezer counter
Now a page of our Sande Morning calendar: 136 years ago today, 30 September, 1882 and the time after... the day the future scientist Johannes William "Hans" was born in Germany.
Gezer invented a device that was later known as Gezer counter for the method of detection and measurement of radio integrity.
Gezer counter science is one of the main foundations, it became the main foundation of pop culture, and in 1950 it became a film "Bells of Coronado", in which scientists Roy Rogers and Del Evans acted for the first time:

The bad cells of the defense system can be seen from a new cancer tag
The damage to the defense system from the new cancer tag can be 'visible' and can be eliminated
Hinting to identify bad cells during treatment gives guidance to the defense system
Using this method, a patient’s defense cells can be removed and replaced in the hospital
Then, they can 'see' the common protein for several cancers and then extract it and then re-suspend it.
The positive results of different types of cancers are being seen in a trial for ICT.
A woman was criticized for seeing her bad cells in the defense system, and it was observed that her dembregate cancer has been eliminated for more than 18 months.
This method can extract and replace the protective cells of a patient in the hospital so that they can "see" the common protein found in several cancers called HER2, and then re-evaluate the cells.
In Bethesda, Maryland, U.S. National Cancer Institute Professor J. Brzofski said: "Our results show that this is very encouraging."
Pro Brzofski said that HER2 causes "a number of types of cancer to develop", including breast, dimbrenth, pheasant and colorectal cancer.
It is useful to extract the protective cells of patients and to "indicate them" to detect cancer-like cells in a type of luchemy treatment.
After their SSL presence, Connie West condemned the old trump's argumental speech on MGA Hat.
It's not okay.
After Cana West's best performance, in which she praised US President Donald Trump and said that they would also become government in 2020, during the night of Saturday's Live, she denounced the studio.
After his third song performance, called Ghost Town, in which they wore the Mac America's Great Cap, he protested against the Democrat and refused to support the Tromp.
They said, "That's why I've been talking to a bunch of dumb people and they say, "Why do you want to like the trumpet? They're the next of kin."
Yet, if I were concerned about succession, I would have left America for a long time."

The Star Kit Herrington of the Game of Thrones raised a question about the toxic massculinity
Kit Herrington is known for his role as a sword-bearer in the WBO's Violet Medieval Fancie Series Game of Thrones.
However, 31-year-old Actor has questioned the role of Macho Hiro, who said that watching such roles on screen often causes many young boys to be moved by them and they feel that such a difficult task is necessary to gain honor.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit told them that they felt 'something wrong' and asked how to end the problem of toxic msculinity in #MeToo.
Recently, Kitt married 31-year-old artist of Game of Thrones, and they believe they feel 'a lot of strength' to talk about the problem.
He said, 'I think I'm pretty strong personally now -- are we doing something wrong with Macculinity?'
Are we teaching men that when we are old, they will suffer problems on the screen?
Kit thinks that television may be partly responsible for the toxic massculinity, he thanked its many men chief character.
He added: 'What happens and what is taught?
Do young people believe that whatever they are taught on TV and on the street, they have to do some specific work to be a man?
In my view, this has indeed become one of the great questions of our time — how can we change it?
Because it's obvious that something's wrong with young men's thoughts.'
In an interview, they also believed that when the end of the next heats comes again, they would not participate in any pre-war or sequential event, and they also said that they had programmed a number of 'war field and horse riding' programs.
As of November, Kit Sam Shephard will be working in the new series of True West, which is the story of a film producer whose brother is bubbling.
Recently, Akter told them that the best thing for them from Game of Thrones was to meet their wife daily.
He said, “This is what my wife has given me, so I think that she has given me my future, and my life has gone beyond this.”
Roz has played the role of Ygrite, who is a fan of Kate's favorite John Snow in Amy Award Winning Fantci series.
In June 2018, the couple married a family in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, 14% of new cases in China have increased
China has announced that 14% of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in the country have increased.
Health authorities have reported that more than 820,000 people throughout the country are suffering from this disease.
Only 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Looking at recent changes, most new cases are reported on sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China as a result of a blood infection.
At a conference in Greece, the Chinese health authorities reported that the number of people suffering from HIV was nearly zero.
Although, every year, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection is a serious problem from the Chinese LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but it is reported that LGBT is quite different from people in the community.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women because of the country's revolutionary values.
Because of a number of disease infections, sex in these relationships is not safe enough.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve the problem, for which everyone has been promised access to HIV medicine.
Maxine Wars rejected the fact that their employees have cleared the data of the GPS screen, they told it 'dangerous lie' and 'a way to improve'.
The U.S. representative, Maxine Wars, unfortunately told the charges filed on Saturday, saying that one of their employees had posted three Republican U.S. Senators' personal information on the Wikipedia pages of Lomak.
Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were being tested by the author of the Altra-Right Wing and the website.
Vances tweeted on Twitter, "false, false, and so much hatred."
According to the information, the senators Linds Graham and two senators of Utah, Michael Lee and Ordin Hatch, were included in the addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina.
This information was seen on-line by Thursday, who a Capitol Hill had posted, when a person called to the Supreme Court was hearing the sine panel on charges of juvenile immorality against Bret Kwanagh.
Some of the three senators were asking questions about the young man.
Hill says that Gateway Puntit and RedState know about the IP addresses that identify the source of the poster, it was reported that it was connected to the office of the Source Exchange and that one of the employees of the market continued the information.
He said, "This is a slander, a lie, a lie.
"No one of my employees -- whose identity, personal information and security are being put into prison for these false and false charges -- was responsible for any kind of damage to this information.
“This is a slander, a slander, and a falsehood.”
Soon, Varys posted online for the cleaning of the poll, including the pre-White House press secretary.
Flecher wrote, "It's anger because of this rejection."
"This is known that their personality is not like being a member of Congress.
When a charge is brought against a man, he shall not be angry, and shall not do so.
They shouldn't be rebels.
They should not question the person who accused them.
They should be quiet and patient."
It seemed that compared to the response of the Flecher Wars, the judge was insulting the Democrats of Kwanang, who accused the young man of being very angry when he heard them.
The Republican Umar Nuvaro also tweeted his views on Twitter to lose the exchange in the Middle Term Election.
They tweeted, "If this is true, it is a very serious thing."
In his statement, Wirs explained that their office had warned appropriate authorities and law enforcement units for these fraud claims.
They said, “We will now be informed of the guilty; and will they be held responsible for what they have done, or will they be held responsible for what they have done?”; and it is not for anyone else who has done an evil deed to me.
Johnny English Strikes Again’s review was not considered to be more adept by the Josué’s work by Rowon Atkinson
From the British perspective, any new film shows the importance of shortness in a traditional way and seems to have been applied to this version of Johnny English's action-comady Spuff Frenchie, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back in 2011 by Johnny English Reborn.
Will we self-inflicted about how we definitely believe that we are talking about the new export opportunity of the nation?
At any rate, the Pope and the Lord Face-in-Office have his license with the wrong Johnny English to re-make the restless things -- which are only more famous than anything else than his name -- it is a huge comical creation for areas where non-English people live.
They are definitely Secret Agents, who managed to show Dash Been a little bit and a doll for the crew who contributed a single note to the Fire Theme Tune in 2012 in the 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
They are basically travelers and are the International Man Atkins of Secret, whose role in the Barcelona TV advertisements has been forgotten beyond the chaos of the week.
In this new JE output, only one or two good signals can be seen.
I liked Johnny English very much to go to Helicopter with a Caucasian Medieval suit and see rotor Blade on his helmet.
Physical comedy on screen is a sort of trap for Atkinson, but laugh came very low and seemed strange-like, especially 007 and Mission No.
Smile comes as if it's not for comedy ages, it's for children, and Johnny English's strange misunderstandings are not exactly patient with me, and I've preferred bein' to be in the comic-film of Atkinson.
It's always a terrible thing to say right now in Great Britain.
The UK's most secret network of spies has been hacked by a cyber hacker, which identified all the British agents' activities on this network that could affect the agent's work - it's a painful event for Kevin Elden.
This is the last support for the former Prime Minister, who is already struggling with many political and ill-loved problems: this Quasi-Teresa character can be well-established by Emma Thompson, but the script is not too hard to work on this script.
His secret counsellors told him that all the work has been done with Joshua, he will have to bring to someone who has served him.
This meant that Johnny English has to fight himself, who now has a school master at a Pash Institute, but what an indeterminate operator should be like to do on this record: there are some good stories in it, as well as reading English at the Rock-Type Academy School by Jesús.
English has been sent back to the Emerging Whitehall for briefing and Ben Miler again has been combined with their very old-fashioned side boff.
Boff's married, he's been trying to be a Pandubbi commander, his role is in Jolly-Hocky-Stix, in which Vicki Paperdine has not been found.
Therefore, Batman and Robin find some serious mistakes in the secret service of his Majesty when they face Ophelia Bolettova, the beautiful scene of Olga Kruelenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister comes to the point of his charismatic technical arbiter, who claims to have solved the computer problems of Britain: sinner Jason Volta took over the role of Jack Lace.
English and Bug Farsial Hei-Jinx start their Odyssus: They set fire to a French restaurant working as a windmill; they march through Volta's magnificent ship; and English activates all the arrogance when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to use Volta's interior.
For that final sequence, every film has been definitely pulled, but still it's just and entertaining, the film has a lot of fun for children.
The middle level of the line.
Besides, as I saw in the other Johnny English movies, in this film I didn't understand that Rowan Atkins in the British Film Industry should be given a role that is really due to their talent?
Leber has denied that he is planning to work only four days a week for British people, but the money will meet for five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Leber Party is thinking of becoming a popularist plan, which requires British citizens to work only four days a week - but will meet for five days.
According to the party, the company's owner wants to give the workers part of the survival that will take place through the Royal Artificial Intelligence (AI) so that they can have an additional day off.
This will give the worker a three-day break in a week - but they can still get the same amount.
The sources say that this idea will remain with the economic agenda of the party, and this is the country's plan to benefit workers.
Trades is being promoted four days a week by the Union Congress in order to benefit from the labour-changing economy.
From The Sunday Times, a senior employee of the Leber Party said: 'The law review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
'This won't happen all night, but it's a four-day task-week average, which fits the bill's overall view of the economic recovery party in favour of the entire industrial strategy of the party's employees.'
During the 2017 general election campaign, the Green Party promising four-day work week will not be the first party to support this idea.
Although this desire is currently not fully supported by the Leber Party.
A spokesperson for the Leber Party said: 'Four day-to-day work is not the party's policy and the party is not thinking about it.'
Shado Chancellor John McDonald used the Labour Assembly last week to present his views on the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said that he was determined that the use of 'faceless leaders' and 'unspeakers' should be restored to power in farms.
Shado Chancellor's plans also mean that current water companies can't get their full share back because the lab government can 'cut' on the basis of the wrong actions said.
They also confirmed the plan to make employees part of the company's boards and to make up 10 percent of the private sector companies' equity plans for employees, which can receive an annual profit of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham tells John Kennedy "60 minutes" whether the FBI's testing of Kevin could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against J.B.I. against the J.B.C.A. has delayed their designation in the Supreme Court for at least a week, and the question arises whether the conclusions of the Bureau have helped a Republican senator to recover his support.
In a witness broadcast on Sunday, Scott Pelle of the dialogue of "60 minutes" asked the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether there was a chance of finding something by the FBI that would move their minds to change.
Kennedy saw more clearly than his partner in South Carolina.
"I think so, yes," said Kennedy.
"I said that I talked to the judge in the hearing.
After that, when the charge came before them, I called them, and said, 'Did you do this?'
They were certain that they had the clear evidence (of the truth).
Although, Graham's vote, it seemed, was a stoneline.
"I had made up my mind about Bret Cavena and it would require explosive charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know: Bret declined in a long way," Graham added, referring to Christine Blass ford.
And he could not justify what they had named him.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Sitting Festival, and has it been reduced to poverty?
This Saturday will be hosted by New York, the Global Sitting Festival, which is an annual music program that features a number of powerful stars, and is as powerful a mission as it is; end the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Sitting Festival will bring tens of thousands of people, not only to the Great Lone of Central Park, but also to increase their awareness of the real goals of the Agenda for the Eradication of Poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Global Sitting Festival, an international support group, is an extension of the Global Power Project, which hopes to increase the number of people actively fighting it and end poverty.
For the program to get free tickets (i.e. if you are not ready to pay for VIP tickets), those going to the concert will have to be volunteers to help create awareness of their goals, to email a world leader, to call a number of jobs, or to perform "activities" in other ways.
But how successful is the Global Sitting in the next 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of enlisting people through free music programs the right way to encourage action, or is there just another matter of so-called "clicking" -- people think they're making a difference by signing online or sending tweets?
Since 2011, Global Sitzin has said that he has "activities" more than 19 million of his supporters in advancing efforts for various goals.
It says that these activities have helped world leaders to affect the lives of more than $2.25 billion people, which is set at $37 billion, and to announce the benefits.
At the beginning of 2018, the group provided 390 objections and announcements from its activities, of which at least $10 billion are already distributed or rich.
The group is expected to have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some major resistances include, the Power of Neutrision, a U.K.'s participation of the state interns and activists, who, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens, prevented Rwanda from providing $35 million to complete the coverage in the account, promising to "help children to grow up to their full potential".
In London in April 2018, during a live concert, Power of Nutration's ambassador Tracy Ulman said to the crowd, "We can make a record of history by British government, donor, national government, and, with the help of global citizens like you, with the help of the social injustice of cognition."
The group also said that after more than 5,000 operations to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced a project called Power of Neutrision, which will reach 5 million women and children with food interventions.
A question often asked on your website is, "Why do you think we can eliminate more poverty?"
The Global Sitzen replied: "This will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and colourful opposition movements, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.

Russian energy can be used to create barriers to exports to America for "unbound" - internal savings
According to Washington Examiner, internal secretive Ryan Zinke revealed that, along with the Middle East, Washington "if necessary" could support US nuclear power in the US markets.
Zink accused Russia of working in Syria - especially where it is operating on the invitation of the legitimate government - of finding new energy markets.
He said, "I think it's because of their presence in the Middle East that they want to power, as they have done in southern Europe, in Eastern Europe.
And, according to the authority, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to ensure that the seaways remain open, and, if necessary, unblock, so that it can ensure that their energy is not in the market," they said.
Jinke was referring to the participants of the program organized by Konzomers Energy Alliance, who call themselves "the voice of energy users" in the United States.
They compared Washington's view to deal with Russia and Iran saying that they are effectively equal.
Referring to Russia as "a moving fuel economy", he said, "financial options in the case of Iran and Russia are taking advantage of Cambodia, fuel consumption and substitution."
The tromp administration, taking place in Russia, is on the mission to promote its oiled natural gas export in Europe as the largest option for European users.
To that extent, the authorities of the US President Donald Trump himself tried to get Germany out of the "invalid" North Stream 2 pipeline project, according to the tromp that made Berlin a "containment" of Moscow.
Moscow has stressed that $11 billion of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which is ready to double the current pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely financial project.
Kremlin's argument is that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is driven only by financial reasons and is an example of inappropriate competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Richard Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe that we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that users should be able to choose the users."
Germany opposed the US Rush, which has reaffirmed its resistance to the project.
Germany's Industry Research Organisation, the Federation of German India (BDI) has said to avoid bilateral tensions between the European Union's energy policy and the EU's energy policy between Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent meeting between the Federation of German India (BDI), Dieter Kmf, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, said, "I have a great deal of trouble when a great government intervenes in our energy supply.
The senator of Massachusetts said that Elizabeth Warren would "think seriously" on the issue of joining the President's position in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told Saturday that she would "think seriously" on the run of the President's position after the mid-term election.
During the Town Hall in Hollyok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the race.
According to The Hill, he said, "The time has come for women to go to Washington and join our broken government, and it includes women on top of it."
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the election for the presidency."
Warren said during the Town Hall, assuming President Donald Trump, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I'm completely worried about what Donald Trump is finally doing for our democracy," he said.
Warren, Trump, and their Supreme Court are looking forward to examining Brett Cavena.
Friday on a tweet, Warren said, "Perhaps we need to check the FBI before we can talk."
However, a continued survey on Thursday showed that most of Warren's components do not think they should fight the 2020 election.
According to the Sffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Pole, the "possible" thinking of Massachusetts was that the senator should not fight the election.
Battys supported the fight against this kind of choice.
At the same time, the previous Governor Bell Patrick showed more support in the fight against election, where 38 percent supported possible involvement in the election process and 48 percent opposed it.
Other high profile democratic names discussed to possibly fight election by 2020 include former president Bedin and Vermont Senator Burny Sanders.
Biden said they would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Returns the PTSD of the pallin in the Donald Trump rail of Sarah Palin
The 26-year-old track Polin spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday night, they were arrested for domestic violence
In a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he said to the audience, "My son feels the way he is coming back, because of the feelings he feels for other families that feel the effects of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers are returning with."
Palin said to his arrester "in the chamber" and said about his son and other serving soldiers, "They come back with a little change, they come back hard, they think it's a privilege for their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other members of the army have sacrificed for the country."
According to a spokesman for the Vila Police Department, Dan Bennet was arrested on Monday at Alaska's residence, and was charged with rape and abuse by a woman.
18 Kingdoms Support the Challenge of New Refugee Policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian District are supporting a new US policy that refuses to protect refugees or victims of domestic violence.
NBC News reported that 18 states and the delegates of the country have issued a court-martial in Washington on Friday to support a refugee who challenges the policy.
The United States Civil Liberties Union did not reveal the full name of the river in the session of the Dairy Grace Club in August.
He said his partner "and the sons of his violent group" abused them, but the US authorities refused their request to protect July 20th.
He was taken into exile in Texas.
Greek-supported government prosecutors described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the countries that are facing major problems of group and domestic violence, which create candidates for US refugees in large numbers.
The New American Refugee Policy reversed a 2014 decision by the non-performing Apple Board, which allowed refugees who fled from domestic violence to apply for refuge.
The District of Colombia's Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement to Friday that the new policy "is disregarding the decades-old rule, the federal and international law."
"The federal law requires that justice be determined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances for all refugee claims, and that such an objection violates that principle," the judge-friend said.
Atorni further argued in the summary that the U.S. economy that rejects the entry of refugees, saying that it is more likely that they will be born and "require labour".
Atorni General Jeff Sessions ordered hearings not to protect the victims of domestic violence and domestic violence in June.
In his June 11 announcement, the sessions said: "For those who leave their homes for persecution or fear because of their nationality, religion, nationality or any particular social group, there is refuge."
The refuge was never to reduce all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people are facing every day around the world.
The number of dead in the search for survivors is two - fold survival efforts in the palace
For survivors, the situation was too serious.
"It seems extremely stressful," said 35-year-old mother Lisa Kusuma, who was in the middle of the Palou exit.
"Every minute brings an embulence to the dogs.
The water is pure and pure.
It was found that they returned to their own upright houses, and that they brought forth fiery vessels, and that they sought to save all that was found.
7.5 Hundreds were injured in the earthquake, and hundreds were drowned in the hospital.
Some injured people, including D. Harris, who were facing a fractured spine and hip, rest outside the Palu army hospital, where the patients were being treated openly because of strong earthquake attacks.
His eyes filled with tears as he felt the shocks of a violent earthquake in his fifth hotel room, shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I was pushed into the wall's vault," Harris told the Associated Press, as well as told that their family was in the city for marriage.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador charged China with 'prejudication'
A week after a U.S. daily newspaper in China, the U.S. ambassador of China accused the US press of using the U.S. press on Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday, after trying to appeal to Congress elections on November 6th, he referred to a supplement to the pead of China Delhi, China's most-selling newspaper in Iowa, which rejects the charge.
Trup's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections, the US authorities told Reuters that there was a new step in the effort to pressure China through Washington.
While advertising to promote trade for foreign governments is common, Beijing and Washington are currently in a situation of growing trade in war, which saw them applying limit-values to each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that China's first trade-related border-shalk Ayova was designed to strike exporters in countries such as China, which supported the Republic of Trump's party.
Terry Bransted, former governor of the United States and Iowa for a long time, told China's main exporter of works related property that Beijing has hurt US workers, consumers and businesses.
Bransted wrote in his opinion in Sunday's Ten Moines Register, that China is now running a preaching campaign in our own free press to double that evil."
"In its propaganda media, giving the advertisements paid in the Deas Moines Register, China's government's speech about freedom and freedom of expression is taking advantage of the American culture," Bransted wrote.
"In view of the fact that the media Chinese Communist party is closed in the heart of the party, contrary to this, on the newsstand on the side of the road in Beijing, you will have limited unsatisfied voices and will not show any proper reflection of the unconcerned opinions that Chinese people can have on the economic worry line of China," they wrote.
He said, "One of China's leading news posts has hesitated to make a proposal to publish their article," although they did not mention the name of the news paper.
Before the Republican Middle Ages were chosen with the defeat of Cavena, the analysts warned women to separate their minds before they chose the Republican Middle Ages.
Since the Supreme Republic has been supporting and defending the hopeful Bret Cavena of the Supreme Court in the face of several charges against the Yon-Republic, the analyst has warned that they will see a response from women during future medieval elections, especially during the elections.
Its interrelated feelings are very great, and most republics are already showing on record that they want to move forward with an opinion.
These things cannot be returned," Grant Rihir, professor of political science at Maxwell University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Rehir said they suspect that the last minute the pressure will be enough to calm the disheartening minds of the FBI to investigate by Senator Jeff Flick (R.R.I.).
According to a Washington D.C. newspaper, a senior consultant and national spokesman for MoveOn said on Friday: "Women can't forget what happened tomorrow -- they can't forget it tomorrow or November."
On Friday morning, when the Republicans controlling the judicial committee wanted to move forward with the name of the witness of Dr. Christine Blesi Ford, the exhibitors who showed up in the Senate's office said, "The November is coming!", Mike reported.
A non-governmental analyst, Stu Rothenburg, told the news site, "Democratic enthusiasm and motivation chart are being removed."
"People say it's already great; it's true.
But it may be more, especially women of sub-city thinkers and 18-to-29-year-old thinkers, who don't often vote when the president doesn't like."
Public witnesses have already said that if the Republican confirmation is advanced, there is a possibility of opposition before describing the charges of Young Prosecuting by the Supreme Court.
According to NBC News, former president Michael Steele of the Republican National Committee said, "This has become a complicated mess for the GOP."
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or a cabinet vote, it's also related to how the Republic has handled it and how they have dealt with it," Prime Minister Gi Cecil of the Priorities U.S.A., who helped the Democrat in the election, pointed out the news channel.
Although the U.S. is divided in this case to some extent, it seems that they should believe in those of Ford and Cavana, who saw most of them taking sides with the Cavana.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in the testimony of Ford either or possibly, while 35 percent said that they believed in Cavena probably or possibly.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kevin may or may have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating forord and, at least another Fries, Debora Ramirez's charges, The Gargerian reported.
Ford took an oath last week and testified to the Senate Judicial Committee that Kevin fought with him when he was 17 years of age.
Ramirez's accusation that the Supreme Court's nominee showed his genes when they joined a party while reading in 1980.
A plan to start a new Internet with Google and Facebook is being developed by the developers of the World Wide Web
World Wide Web Inquisitor Time Burns-ley has launched a startup that wants to block Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the industrial legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the Open Source Platform Solid of Burns-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and what people will be allowed to access.
In a special witness with the fast company, Burns-ley said in a joke that the intention behind Inrupt is to achieve "world workshops".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
App uses Solid to allow people to create their own "interactive online data store" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-dos, calendars, music libraries and other personal and practical tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available on all one browser and at the same time.
The strange thing about personal online data storage is that it depends entirely on the user who can access information.
The company calls it "personal enhancement through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to bring resources, processes, and skills to the company so that Solid can make everyone available.
Currently, Burns-Lee, Bruce, IBM purchased a security platform, some on-staff developers, and Valtiary Coders community to work on the project.
Since this week, industrial developers around the world can use tools available on the Inrupt website to create their own remediated app.
Burns-li said he and his team aren't talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to start the whole change, where all their business models will end at night.
"We are not asking for permission from them."
In a post published on Saturday, Burns-ley wrote that Inrupt's "Solid Mission needs to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web.
In 1994, Burnsley changed the Internet when they established the World Wide Web Consciousry in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burns-Le Net neutrality has been a powerful voice in the debate.
Until the Inrupt launch, Burns-ley World Wide Web Consciousium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will continue to be the organizer and maintainer.
"I am incredibly hopeful for the next century of the web," Burns-ley said.
Bernard Van: The Hell of the WW1 Victoria Cross Clarics
During World War I, the only priest of the Victoria Cross, the only church of England, was celebrated in their home city for 100 years as a warrior.
Lieutenant Colonel Ravend Bernard Van won this prize in the attack in Belgium and Lehocourt on September 29, 1918.
Although, four days later, they were killed by a sniper and they never knew that they had won the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, the memorial stone was unfurnished by two of their gates in Rasden, Northamptonshire.
One of their sons, Michael Van, said it was "a beautiful sight" that this was being unsurpassed 100 years after their grandfather's award.
According to London Gegett, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vain led his battalion in Channel De Saint-Quentin "between a very heavy core, under heavy bullets and machine guns" in the field of war.
Later, they went to the firing line and, with the "great power", took the lead of the army line before taking the only field-gun and captured three pieces.
Only a month before the war ended on October 4, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper.
72-year-old Michael Vaughn said in his father's office, "There were some things that I know can never be equal to, but that we've got to do."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also sacrificed after Prade, led by Brandwood Imperial Uth Band.
Michael Van said that they are "very privileged to play the role in the parade" and he said, "A real leader's strength is being demonstrated by the support given by many people."
MMA's fans were awake all night to see 206, but instead, they got a pepa Pig.
Imagine, you've been living to see a 206 billaire full of bricks all night, but the main program was forbidden to watch.
There were 13 matches in Sán Jose's Bill, which included six cards on the main card and was showing live all night on Channel 5.
Six o'clock in the morning, just as Gagard was preparing to face each other and Rory McDonald, the viewer's papa of coverage in the U.S. stopped turning into a pag.
They were very discouraged, especially after they had woke up early in the morning for the battle.
On Twitter, a praiser described switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke".
When asked about the broadcast, the top vice president of Belarus, Dave Schwartz, said, "This material was not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children's programming."
""Pepapa the Pig," yeah."
President Scott Koker of the Belator Company said they are going to work on their schedules to include viewers of the U.K.
"I think when I think about the report, I think we might find a solution," Kokar said.
"But then there will be six in the morning and we will not be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when this was changed, the sound of many words was heard, and they were not all right.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you it won't be like that the next time.
We'll keep it down to five times six -- as we usually do -- and when we tried to deliver something more for the praisers, it happened a little bit more.
It's a miserable situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Dealer felt 'unsafe' in the case of work
Ollipic Gothachor Tom Delly says he was overcome with a sense of humor for all because of his work -- but he was moved to succeed.
24-year-old Dale said he didn't realize until he got to high school saying, "Everyone's not like me."
Speaking on the radio 4 Dart Island disk, presented by Lauren Kalarn, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said that when he became a father, he was less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular presentation of the long-term show, Curtis Young, has taken months off due to illness.
When he appeared as a socialist in the first Clardon's program, Deli said he felt "low" in comparison to everyone because "the love of boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He said, “Today my feelings are similar to those of others, and my feelings are very different. They have given me strength and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was also "special," he said, so that he wouldn't let anyone down when they finally found out about his work.
Hei-profile LGBT has become a winner of the Olympics twice and has used its presence in national games in Australia to reduce homosexuality from more countries.
He said that he spoke openly because he felt happy when he was able to live without any trouble and wanted to "hope" others.
Three times World Champion said a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - when he was in love - "I was surprised."
Dale married Oscar winner, who is 20 years old, but he said the age was never an issue.
"When you're so young," he went to his early Olympics at the age of 14 and died of cancer three years later from his father -- he said that it was hard to find a man who had had such a low age.
In June, Dwarf Robert Ree-Dali became the parent of a son named Black-Dali, and Deli said that his "full view" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it'd all be 'I need to win the sound career'," he said.
"You'll know, there are more things than the Olympic sound players.
I'm an Olympic sound teacher, Robbie."
Their son's name is as his father Robert, who died after dying from brain cancer in the age of 40 in 2011.
Dale said that their father did not accept that they were going to die and that what they wanted to know the last time was whether the 2012 London tickets had come to them -- because they wanted to sit on the front line.
He said, “I did not say to them that you will not stay in the line for them, my father.”
He said, ‘I held their hand until their very eyes were shut and they were dead. So I took them by force, and I considered them not to be a strange thing.’
The following year, Deli took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the awards.
"I only knew that this is what I've seen dreaming of my whole life -- putting up with the crowd in the Olympics, there was no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired their first favorite song-stream wife, Hitler Smol, who was playing with them during the Olympics and who were still listening to their prayers.
Desert Island will be released on Sunday at BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST.
Output-of-form Michaelson from the radar copy of Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will record on Sunday when they play their 47th Reader Cup match, but they will have to change their form to prevent it from becoming a faulty metal.
For the 12th time in the two-year program for record, Captain Jim Furick put Michaelson out of the game for Saturday's Forbols and Forsam.
Instead of being an attraction center, as they are often made for the United States, the five-time lead winner spent his day among the players and working to improve his playing skills.
The 48-year-old player's title Le Golf National Course, which is never a direct driver on his career, has not been a model fit for the golf course, where those who have not been active for a long time are regularly punished with wrong shots.
And where the course is not as easy, there will be the British Open Campione Franco Molinari in Sunday's 9th match, who played together with Ruki Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the US player, starting with four points in the 12 singles matches, starts with a strong start, Michaelson's match can be quite important.
Furick trusted his husband, not that they could say anything else.
"They fully understood their role, got my back kicked and wrapped me in their left hands and said they'll be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
She's a Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot in the past to these teams and this week.
I probably didn't think of playing her two matches.
I had more ideas, but it worked the way we did it and the way we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to go forth like everyone else does."
Michaelson will pass the record of Nick Faldo for the most played reader cup matches on Sunday.
This reader can mark the end of the copyright career that has never touched the heights of their personal record.
Michaelson has won 18th, 20th and sevenths, although Furick said his presence brings some interference in the team.
"He's funny, he's violent, he's a guest, he likes to make fun of people, and his presence in the team room is special," he explained.
"I think young players also enjoyed going to them this week, which was fun to see.
He only gives a little to play.
Captain Thomas Byron of Europe knows that a great increase can soon be lost
Thomas Byron, the European captain, knows from his experience that the rider’s cup can easily turn into a much larger drive in the last day alone.
Dan held his first show in Vladerama in March 1997, where a party in the captain of Sev Ballestiros had gained five points on the Americans, but with the victory of 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2, with the lowest margin, just reaching the finish line.
"You're reminding yourself that we had a great lead in Valderama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, where we were lost, and in Valderama, we just won," Beorn said to the 2018 class on Friday, 5-3 and tomorrow after seeing the 10-6 increase in Le Golf National.
So history will show me and all the people of that team that it's not over.
You'll be all right tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It won't end until you have received a number on the board.
We have a target, and he's trying to win this traffic, and that's where to keep focus.
I have always said, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are well aware that the biggest players in the world are standing on the other side."
Byron added how their players showed up on the hard golf course: "I will never get ahead of myself in this.
It's a different hard time tomorrow.
Tomorrow's personal display will go forward, and it's a different thing.
When things are going well, it's nice to go there with the partner, but when you go out there personally, your ability is tested as a golfer.
This is a message you need to bring to the players to show their greatest tomorrow.
You leave your mate behind, and he will have to go and give him his best show."
By contrast, anti-Jim Furick will be looking for a better personal display for his players that they had made as a party, except for Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who had received three out of four.
Because of Europe's "miracles in Medina" before losing, because of being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, the Furic itself is on both sides of the great response of those great last days."
"I remember every joke," they said in answer to the question, "How did Captain Ben Cranshaw manage his players the last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this speed is reciprocal, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
Verily We! We have made the line to go straight with Us, and We have made the people to enter into it, as We had supposed; verily We are going to perform a wonder yesterday.
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the response attack with Rory Maclero at the top of the match, where Paul Kssy, Justin Roz, John Raham, Tommy Flitewood and Ian Polter are the top half of the other European order.
"I had built their group in this order because I think it covers all of them," Byron said about his only choice.
Germany’s new wargate was restored
In 2014, Germany's new wargates were to be commissioned to change the wargates of the century, but because of the rapid increase in criminal systems and incomes, the local media reported that it would not be less than a year later.
According to the Dai Zet newspaper, the commission of "Reinland-Pfles" from a military speaker, although it is the main port of War in Baden-Württemberg category, has now been established until the first half of 2019.
Port was supposed to be part of Nasena in 2014, but post-defending issues affected the success of the important project.
The four Beden-Wurtmburg ships were ordered back in 2007 to be replaced by the once-in-a-kind Bremen-type wargates.
It is believed that they will provide powerful top, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles with a combination of some steel techniques such as low radar, aperture and audio.
Other important features include long-term storage periods - it is possible to prepare the latest wargates for two years from private ports.
Although, the constant delay means that the state-of-the-art wargate - which allows Germany to have the opportunity to launch a power project in foreign countries - will be delayed until the time of entry into service, Di Zin commented.
In the past year, the F125 War pod was a good boutique, when German Nausena officially refused to commission the pot and returned to Bloom and Was Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time Nassena returned a ship to the ship's creator after the delivery.
Few people were aware of the causes of the return, but the German media referred to several important "software and hardware offences", which undermined the warship when the war mission was launched.
Software failures were particularly important because the Baden-Wurtmburg-class ships will be operated by a group of 120 sailors -- which is only half the population of the ancient Bremen-class wargates.
In addition, the fact that the ship is more dramaticly weightier that reduces its display and limits the ability to add future upgrades.
The "Rinland-Pfles" of 7,000 tons is thought to be twice the same category of ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the whole project's value tag - including driver team training - is becoming a point.
This is said to have reached €2.2 billion from the beginning to €3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
The problem of new wargates that have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings is being linked to the moral strength of Germany.
In the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chief committee for the protection of Germany, admitted that the "Tanthe-Capable Ships are actually ending in Nassena."
The authorities said that in time this issue became serious, because old ships were removed from service, but no replacement ships were available.
He said that none of the wargates in Baden-Württemberg were able to join the Nassena.
Listening to the secret life of national trust firefighters
The aim of the new research carried out in an aesthetic of the Scottish Highlands is to clarify how insects use natural sight in their prey for food.
It is hoped that new light will be shed on the behaviour of the emerging aliens and will help direct future protection activities.
The study conducted by scientists from the National Trust in Scotland will follow the Dobington Fireworks in Inverve Garden with the Soprano Pipestrels.
Special records will be placed at the main locations around the end to track the activities of the bats in the entire weather.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also use the mobile search using managed detectors.
The behavior of the Batt calls from the expert sound analysis of all recording shows what nations are doing.
The map and reports of the natural habitat will be prepared for an extensive visualization of their behaviour.
Rob Dover, the nature protection consultant of NTS, hopes that the results will determine which area of natural life is most important to the lighthouses and how they are used by every nation.
This information will help to determine the benefits of management tasks such as the construction of grass fields and how to properly maintain forestlands for lighthouses and other associated nations.
In Scotland and the U.S.A., there has been a lot of collapse in the last century.
They are at risk of development and development, which affect bird stocks and damage the natural habitat.
The Pwan turbine and light system can also generate shock, because some chemical treatments of the flypaper and building materials, as well as the attack by parental bills, can be dangerous.
The candles aren't really blind.
Though, because of the tradition of their sacrifice, when it comes to catch the prey, their ears are more profitable than their eyes.
They use an cleaned eco-location technique to predict faults and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the skin from a very serious point of view to more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important buildings and 76,000 hectares of land.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly monitor and sometimes rescue birds.
The organisation has established the first and only dedicated Bat Reservoir in Côte d'Ivoire, in the woodland of Dumfrez and Galova, which is home to eight of the ten ill-fated nations in Scotland.
Este manager David Thompson says that Este is a better place for them.
"Here in Triv we have a great area for the lighthouse," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all good natural habitats.
But there's a lot about lightning that's still unknown, so what we're doing here in other finishes will help us to understand what things they need to get away with."
They stress the importance of the lighthouse test prior to keeping and protecting the limbs, because it is possible that the loss of the maternally healthy disease could destroy 400 females and children, possibly the entire local population.
It is not lawful for the light to kill, to scourge, or to disturb, or to destroy, the flames of fire.
The Scottish official of the Bat Convention Trust, Elizabeth Fahrel, has encouraged the public to move forward to help.
They said, “We have a great deal of knowledge about our people, and we do not know how their people are doing.”
Ronaldo dismissed the charges of rape, while the prosecutors tried the German newspaper.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called them "false news" against their rape, saying that people use their name to "declare God".
Their lawyer, German newspaper, is going to judge Der Spigel, who published the charges.
In 2009, Kathryn Mayorga, a United States woman, was charged with rape at Las Vegas Hotel in Portugal and Juvents Forward.
Der Spigel reported on Friday that he paid the woman $375.000 to remain silent about the event.
After reporting on the allegations, according to Instagram Live Video, 33-year-old Ronaldo told his 142 million followers to "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today, what they said is the Farji news," said D'Our winner in the camera five times.
"They want to preach themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be popular with me, but this is part of their work.
I'm a happy person and everything's fine," the player said smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyer Dar Spigel is preparing to prosecute those charges, according to the Reuters that he called them "indisputable illegal reporting in the field of confidentiality".
Lawyer Christian Shirts said that the player "will be looking for moral damage in the state according to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is said that the event was held in a suite at Las Vegas Hotel in June 2009 and Casino.
According to the papers in the trial panel, after meeting at a night club, Clark County returned to the player's room as Ronaldo and Mayorga told him, where they reportedly raped him.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told them that they were "99 percent" a "good person" whose "one percent" has been disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that this couple had sex, but agreed.
Mayorga's claim was that she had come to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an outside trial because she felt "fearful of violence" and was concerned about "publicly humiliated".
34-year-old says she's now trying to end this argument because she's been harassed just after the incident.
At the time of Ronaldo's attack, Manchester was on the job of joining the Royal Madrid, and in the heat, it was worth €100 million with Italian Duggage Juva.
shortness: U.K. will be sorry for the loss of the developer
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that U.K. will "be sorry for Hamisha" if he loses his position as world leader in car construction after Brexit.
He said Toyota U.K. told B.B. that if Britain left the European Union, he would stop production at Derby's factory in Burnston.
"We need a rope," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that in the situation of No-Dal Brexit, the effect of the delay may be on the workers.
The Burnston Plant produced approximately 150,000 cars, which were exported to the rest of the European Union by Toyota.
In Burnston, Toyota's director, Marvin Cook, said, "I believe that if we leave the European Union at the end of the British March, we will stop the production in our factory."
Other U.K. car manufacturers will work across the border with Honda, BMW and Wland Rover, which is a threat of leaving the EU without agreement.
For example, BMW says she will close her mine plant for a month after breakfast in Oxford.
The main concerns, according to car manufacturers, are related to the threat of supply sequence in the position of No-Dal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on the basis of "just-in-time", in which the U.K. and the European Union, both of the providers of the mode-to-order cars every 37 minutes.
If March 29th leaves the European Union without any money, there may be a law on the border, according to an industry that may cause delays and loss of resources.
The company said that it would be impossible for Toyota to have more than a day's inventory in its D.C. plant, so the production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the cheque plan for future relations with the European Union in Theresa has been "calibrated to avoid these tests on a purely limited basis."
"We need a solution. We want a better solution so that I can not only enjoy the current success, but also the opportunity to achieve it," they told BBC Radio 4.
"Not only has Toota found evidence from other manufacturers that we should be able to continue it completely, which is set to be the most successful of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production will be stopped, but in the long run, warned that the equipment's competitiveness would be reduced by extra cost and that jobs would eventually run.
Peter Sauvalris, who has worked in Bernston for 24 years and is the organizer of the Unit Association, said that their members are too concerned: " Once in my experience these jobs are gone, they never return to Bad.
A government spokesman said, "We have advanced a true and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union."
According to the White House, the Tromp meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again
White House told Sunday that Donald Trumble's debt to the Attorney General, General Rod Rosenstein, could be endured for a high-level meeting "one and a week after" because the Supreme Court's expected Bret Cave continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Agent Robert Muller, who are investigating the possible legal impediments between Russian elections, the trump assistant and Russia.
The tromp dupti will extract or not extract the General, and which endangers the freedom of the mule, the news has warmed the markets of Washington's affluence for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of blocking the president from the 25th investigation to record negotiations with Trump.
Rosenstein broke the report.
But on the last Monday they left the white houses in the midst of the news, saying that they were about to give up.
Instead, Thursday was announced a meeting with Trump, then in the United Nations in New York.
Trup said that they would "not like to remove Rosenstein" but then the Senate Judicial Committee's hearing was delayed at a meeting, both of which witnessed the testimony of a woman who was accused of violence by Kevin and him, Dr. Christine Blasi Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation of a week's claims against Kevin, which resulted in a delay in the execution of the Senate.
The press on the tromp's safe Sara Sanders, looked at the Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "The date has not been set for this, it may be this week, I can see that all other cases that run with the Supreme Court can be pushed forward one more week.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters have claimed: Sanders hasn't reported the White House press since 10 September.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to the "realities" of TV chattels, although they said, "I don't understand the fact that they're great."
He again suggested that direct contact be made between Trump and the press.
He said, "The presidents are asking more questions than any other president," without referring to the evidence, he said, "We have seen these numbers."
Briefing will still be, Sanders said, but "If the press has a chance to ask directly from the president of the United States, it is better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it a lot and you've seen us do it in the past few weeks, and when you can talk to the president of the United States, he's going to take the press for the news."
When leaving the White House or participating in open sessions, or with people in numbers, the drums regularly answer questions at the press conference.
The only press conference is unfortunate.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, in front of the journalists, it is rare and often unique.
Healthcare researchers in the European Union in Scotland write about the threats of shortness
Health Sachiv has written to the workers of the European Union working in Scotland's NHS with the desire to express their gratitude for the country and to remain after Brexit.
Gene Freeman MSP sent a letter to the European Union after the U.S.A. for less than six months.
The Scottish government is already reluctant to meet the cost of requests for citizens of the European Union who are already working in its unorganized public services.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "In the Germans, the U.K. and the European Union are continuing to talk, moving towards the expected decisions in this respect.
But the U.K. government is also advancing its preparations for the possible No-Dal appearance.
I know it's going to be a very uncertain time for you all.
That's why I wanted to repeat how important their contributions are without any regard for the nationality of each staff member.
The European Union, and its associates, brings valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health services, and benefit the sick and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Early surgery by Christian Abercrombby after a head injury
Tency Mike Organ reported that, on Saturday, the tennis state tigers, who suffered beatings from Vanderbilt Camodor on Saturday from 31-27, were chained by Christian Abercrombby after an emergency surgery.
The chief of the state of Tennessee, Koch Rod Read, told the speakers that it was just a short time before the hit Hofftime.
"He came to the edge and just fell there," said Read.
Teachers and medical workers put him on the tractor and gave him oxygen on the sideline before bringing him back for further evaluation.
An official of the state of Tennessee told WSMV Chris Harris in Nashville in Tennessee that Eberdrombi Vanderbilt Medical Center has come out of surgery.
Harris said that "there is no description of the type of injury/limits yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercromby, who is Redshort Sophomore, is in his first seat with the state of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
Before leaving the game, they scored a total of five on Saturdays, which made their seat a total of 18.
Higher stamp duty will be taken from foreign buyers when purchasing wealth in the UK
Foreign buyers will be given a higher stamp duty when they purchase property in the U.K., which will be used to help homeless people under new tower plans.
This step will undermine the success of Corbin’s efforts to attract young thinkers
The extended stamp duty will be applied to people who are not paying for it in U.K.
Tracer expects it to help the homeless - in a year it will add £ 120 million to
Foreign buyers are preparing to raise a high stamp duty rate when purchasing property in the U.K. - which will be used to help homeless people in Theresa today.
The move is seen as an effort to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbin’s campaign, with the word to provide more affordable housing and to highlight high-income workers.
Stamp duty increases in U.K. will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes, which will be encouraged by the government's efforts to deal with gold in different circumstances.
In addition to the current stamp duty, which includes the purchases of two homes and rents started two years ago, the maximum may be three percent.
Tracery expects to grow up to £120 million in a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's newly built property is purchased by non-US residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult to walk on the path of home for first-time buyers.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital - have become "the evil city" because there are more foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy, Boris Johnson, has been faced just a few weeks after the call for a cut-off in Stamp Dutt to help more young people build their first home.
They accused large-scale construction companies of making land and using them to raise the cost of property, and asked Britain to leave the cost-effective house to fix the "Vavos Uncrazy" since May.
Mr. Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposed home improvements, which includes the end of the Kyriao Control and No-Falt dialogues.
They want to give more authority to the reforms to build new homes.
Miss Mee said, "Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime minister to restoring British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means we're going to fix the market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to stay here, work and create life.
Although it is not true that it is as easy for foreign-based companies with non-British residents to buy homes for working British residents.
For many people, the dream of home ownership has been very distant, and the anger of gold is very real in different circumstances."
Jack Ross: 'My last important task is to manage Scotland'
The boss Jack Ross of London says they have to be Scotland's manager in some way.
42-year-old Scott, the North-East Club, is repeating the challenge of reinvigorating the club, which is now in the third place in the League Forest, and which is three points away from the top.
They had gone off the stage of light in the heat of this year after guiding St. Miren to the Scottish Prime Minister's office last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's all," Ross told Bisc Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But from childhood I grew up seeing Scotland with my father in Hampiden, and it's always something that brings me back.
This will only happen when I manage the club."
As the manager of the borderland, Dick Advocket, David Moys, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kein, Gus Poet and Paulo de Canio are among the former Russians.
East Eloa Athletic Boss says they have no fear of following established names in such a big club, which had previously rejected the first of Barnes and Ipswich Town.
"Then can I be expected to be successful by the fact that I can return this club to the Prime Minister's League?"
Because of the design and facilities of this club, it certainly comes into the Prime Minister's League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'll probably see myself here as a success if I can get there to the club."
After spending 15 months at the Koching Staff of Hearts as a assistant boss of Dumberton, Ross' management career has been only three years.
And they helped Eloah to recover from the third round, and to replace St. Mirren with the power of the champions of the champions in the next session.
And Ross says that they feel more easily compared to the work done during their careers in Clyde, Hartalpool, Falkirk, St. Miren and Hamilton Academy.
Regarding the role of Aloa, he said, "Maybe this was a real quarter."
"I really believed that the management was better fit for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did the right thing, did the right thing, and enjoyed some of the same heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to get a lot of things on the weekly basis.
I still deal with them in the matter of stress and pressure, but everything seems to be fine in the matter of management.
I always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, it makes me feel the most comfortable in my old life."

The right time for a pint is Saturday night 5.30, found in survey
The heater's tipper has promoted British rivals, but it has put more pressure on the restaurant's rows.
Pab and the group saw a 2.7-percent increase in sales in July - but the drop-down in the restaurant was 4.8-percent down, and the figures were found.
Peter Martin, Business Consultancy CGA, who wraps up the data, said: "In comparison to the expected participation in the World Cup of Lgatar Smoke and England, July means that in the last June, the same pattern was followed when the pub was 2.8 percent above, except that the restaurant had to face more difficulties.
In the restaurant business, 1.8 percent fell in June and worsened in July.
Drinkers' pubs and bar showed the strongest preference compared to the restaurant.
Eat-in-the-smokers also suffered damage to the smoke, although the restaurants are not as dramatic as the operators.
It seems people wanted to go out for a drink.
The sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent for the whole month, while three percent fell in the case of food.'
Paul Noumen, Space and Hosty Analyst RSM said: "These results have continued the Rwanza seen by us since the end of April.
The impact of weather and major social or game events on the market outside the house is the biggest factor in selling.
It is no wonder that restaurant groups continued to fight, although the decline of 4.8 per cent in sales will be painful, especially during the current pressure.
The weather of the people of the towns was not long for food, nor could it be long for them. The weather would tell them, "Would the heat of the heat which we had experienced in August be of great importance?"
There was a 2.7 percent increase in total sales in pubs and restaurants, with new openings in July, which shows a slow pace in the brand roll-out.
The Kaffer Pitch Tracker collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion, representing trade in the U.S. pub, bar, and restaurants.
One of the five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
The survey shows that one of the five children -- including some 11 minors -- has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
In a survey of 20,000 high school students, Frog Insta found an increase in the pages of "Farge Insta"
The news has increased the threat that young content is being posted
Twenty percent of girls say they have a "head" to show their parents.
One of the five children - some of whom are under the age of 11 - are making social media accounts that they keep secret from the elderly.
In a survey of 20,000 secondary schools, the "Farge Insta" accounts have increased rapidly - a reference to the Photo-Schiering Site Instagram.
The news has increased the doubt that John content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they run a "main" account to show their parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found that a teenager was asking others to "kiss me".
The Digital Ages U.K. and The Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) found free schools that were two of the 11 to 18-year-olds' profiles, which were accepted to hold half of the private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's very disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle Scotish Athletics Board has "Voice for Athletics"
Elid Doyle has been selected as a non-profit director at the annual meeting of the Governing Body in the Scottish Athletics Board.
The most beautiful tracks and fields of Scotland are Italians, and Cherman Ian Beatty told the players of the game to benefit from their extensive international experience in the past decade.
Betty said, "Scottish, U.K., and the World Athletics community have a lot of honor, and we're sure Eletics in Scotland will do a lot of good to bring them to board."
He said, "I want to work as an Italian voice, and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the game in Scotland."
In addition to its four Olympic sound players, the Americans, 200 metres in 1996 in Atlanta, and 400 metres in the race, and now the regular BBC, have been unable to run after a momentary ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I was attacked today.
I'm not going.
Doctors said that it would be time to tell me whether I'd be okay or not and to what extent I could be.
It was a horrendous task, but to be completely healed, to walk again, and to learn to exercise skill today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Compared with the dogs of the mothers by the breast pump advertisements, the idea of people on the Internet caused disagreements
A breast pump company divided an online opinion by an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product called "The World's First Muteable Brest Bomb", the user token company Elvie released a new music music video-incentive advertisement that allows new pump mothers to express themselves.
Four real mothers dance on a song, including some words like, "Yes, I'm breast-feeding myself, but you don't see any stomachs" and "If you haven't noticed, these are not hairs, these are my tits."
The course continues: "Pup it out, pump it out, I'm feeding the dam bebis, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking the lake."
Whatever the case, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, is the cause of the online dispute.
With 77,000 observations and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many have said that this presents the "fear" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows for advertising this product is a very bad decision.
They just like us need to be born to get pregnant and give birth to milk, except that they are stolen within a few days after giving birth to their babies," one wrote.
The Elvie Brest Pump Embarrasing Brah (Elvie/Middle) is fed with suez-bush inside
Another comment: "The mother and the child are obviously suffering.
But why not use them for a breast pump advertisement for mothers who have the opportunity to keep their children?"
Someone else said, "What an immoral announcement!"
Others defended the ad, one of which said that they thought the ad was "hasiper."
"I think it's a very good idea.
I also had it, if I still had been thirsty.
Pamping makes me feel like I'm just a cow.
It's a little weird, but I've seen it the way it is.
One wrote that this is a good product."
Another commented: "This is a wonderful announcement for mothers who pump (mostly in their workplace or in their workplace) and experience as "songs".
It's not an advertisement that promotes the dairy industry or is decisive."
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they were cautiously pumping and dancing in their bra.
The lack of knowledge behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that several women who are pumping the breast say they feel like they are a cow.
Although the Elvi pump is well hidden, it does not contain any virus or tube, and the direct warning presupposes a nursing brah, allows women to go without pumping, arrest their children, and even go out.
In Anna Balerin, partner and Mother, the ECD commented: "Elvi pump is a transformer product that is responsible for a dangerous and magnificent launch.
By drawing comparisons between women and dairy cows, we want to bring salt pumping and its challenges to the spot, showing the feeling of freedom in a fun and related way, which will bring the new pump.
It's not the first time that Elvi's been in the bubbles.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children using the product, designer Martha Jacuboski, was shown to be catatwalking.
Hundreds of traveling children secretly traveled to a tent camp on Texas border
While there is no relative change in the monthly limit crossing, some of the risks are due to the harsh turnouts and neutses offered by the Trup administration that have made it difficult to assign children to the organizers.
Traditionally, the most organizers had appointed the citizens themselves without the document and were afraid to put their own ability to live in the country ahead of them, claiming to be a child.
The danger increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential organizers and other members of the house would give their fingerprints or large members, and the data would be shared again with non-residents.
Last week, a senior official at Matthew Elbens, Apass and the border school began presenting evidence to Congress that the Agency had arrested people who had applied for the planning of non-nebulae.
The agency later confirmed that there was no record of 70 per cent of the arrested.
"Approximately 80 percent of those who are either managers or members of the manager's home live illegally in the country, and most of them are criminals.
So we continue to search for those people," said Mr. Albens.
Requesting the children to be prepared quickly, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which the children had to be brought to the court within a month of being arrested instead of 60 days, which was the last standard for the refugees.
Many people appear through videoconference calls instead of presenting their case for legal status before a non-resident judge.
Those who are considered unfit for release are immediately expelled.
Children who remain confined for a long time are likely to be sick or depressed, which can be explained in a violent desire or runaway attempt, according to the system's report in recent months.
Lawyers or prosecutors said that those cases are taken to a high facility such as Tornillo, where they are ignored by the size of the sign that the child is fighting.
And they also said that giving children enough time to be emotionally prepared or not to tell friends to take them to the city of tent will make them more likely to increase the time they are already struggling with.
Syria asked the US, Förnich and Turkish military forces to return immediately.
Referring to the Sanhedrin of the United Nations, foreign minister Valid Al-Malem also asked the refugees of Syria to return home, even when the war was eight years in the land.
The noble, who also serve as a deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops are illegally living on the Syrian land and "will be treated in accordance with it."
"They must return from the war land immediately and without any condition," they told Ishmael.
Malam stressed that the war is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of people have been evicted from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this war until we both clear all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and "a foreign presence".
The United Kingdom has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian military forces in the province of Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the land that has been destroyed by war.
In the case of refugees, Talm said that conditions were right to return to them and they were responsible for "the spread of fear of terror" of "some Western countries", which prompted refugees to stay away.
He said, "We have called the international community and human organizations to make this return easy."
"They were political on a whole human matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no help to rebuild Syria until there was no political conflict between the indiscriminate and the alien to end the war.
U.S. politicians say that Idelib's last major rebellion is an opportunity to put a buffer zone in the back of a recent conflict between Russia and Turkey to push forward political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Dil or the argument prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces in that country, where three million people lived.
Although, he said there is a clear time limit in the argument, and he also expressed hope that the military action of Nasra will mark the battles associated with the Al-Qaeda Front, which will be "cut off."
The representative of the United Kingdom soon expects to hold a first meeting of a new committee with government and foreign members to prepare the post-war constitution to correct the path to Syria and election.
Talm laid down certain conditions in the committee for the participation of the Syrian government, which said that the panel's work should be prohibited to "examine the articles of the current constitution" and to warn against the intervention.
Why the drums will win in the second runtime
From that argument, Mr. Trup will win the election again in 2020, until many generous or collective people are expecting no guilt and loss to complete their work before the end of the day.
Surely this will be the most dramatic fulfillment of the nation's rank.
So far, there was no apparent fatigue in the viewers.

The elekction house ran in the middle of a strong hold on foreign money
It was not surprising that in Pennsylvania, 17th century, there had been a wave of money or bribes, which was due to the re-establishment of the Congress, which brought two officials to the run of the same seat.
Who recently opened the Moorka for the Democratic Rap Coner Long of the underground Pittsburgh Valley – who won their second seat in the past year's special election.
The lamps were also part of another race, the Republican Cath Rothfes, currently representing the 12th anniversary of the old Pennsylvania, which surrounds each other with the new 17th.
In the case of illegal networking in the Republic of the Republic of the former Isles, after the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January, maps were redesigned.
In the new 17th race, the struggle between the main money weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) had reached the economy of the campaign.
The first 18th Congressional elections in Pennsylvania took place in March, following a large-scale job victory, the name of Lang was widely known in Pennsylvania.
That's why the seat was held by the Republican for nearly a decade, and President Donald Trup won it by 20 points.
Politicians encouraged Protestants a little bit.
To support China, punish El Salvador, then move back
Politicians pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already approved Beijing for their resistance to Washington.
Mr. Trup held an exciting meeting with President Juan Carlos Virela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the management team of the Trup Organisation expelled the participants.
At the beginning of this month, Professor Nort said in a statement, "The political department has decided to call back the U.S. leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the recent decision not to accept Taiwan."
But only El Salvador was punished, which received $140 million in US aid in 2017 with Narcotics Control, Development and Financial Assistance.
The proposed penalty, which included marking cuts and visa restrictions in financial aid, would be painful for Central America and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When internal meetings or meetings were held, the North American and Central American authorities set up a high-level conference, which was seen as a step forward in order to prevent people from moving away from the United Nations, like last year's group or public groups, focusing on security and economic prosperity.
But by mid-September, the top government authorities made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively ended by considering any punishment or crime for El Salvador.
Politicians said that sub-President Mike Pence is now ready to refer to the conference, which has now been scheduled in mid-October.
And three Americans came back to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without any harsh message or punishment.
For Mr. Bolton, White House spokesperson for two politicians with three U.S. officials not to comment on the details of the dabbat or debate, who agree to discuss the internal thinking discussion on the condition of not clarifying the name.

The next case can be reported by Robert Mueller, who now has sufficient evidence in the public record.
Also, according to Mr. Mueller's report, they change the direction of their investigation that if Mr. Trup's campaign to attack our election, he will smile with Russia.
When the Congress comes together, Mr. Trup finds himself responsible in that department, when they prepare themselves to go back to the mindsets and perhaps face a jury of their fellow workers.
Of course, many if and if I don't mean to suggest or suggest that Mr. Tromp and not their opponents in Europe are not inseparable.
We all have options to choose on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can be.

The operating system of the historical centre points around such separation points and the unwelcome march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now have to face a number of separate points.
What will we do if Mr. Trup Dept Atorni General Rod Rosentin, the person who controls the final outcome of Mr. Mueller's test, is out of work?
Rosentin has been in this situation since last year's paper reported on it, he suggested that he keep the president's record and think about their failure to register for the office.
Mr. Rosentin said The Times's account is not correct.
"If the recently requested Brett Kwangoah F.B.I. test is not complete or unbiased - or if he remains firm in the Supreme Court despite the allegations of false persecution and false testimony?
And above all, will we spend the midterm for the Congress, for which Mr. Troms will be responsible?
If we fail in those tests, the population will continue to grow to a long cold.

"People want a family member to take care of them or to take care of them, but they don't take any steps to talk about them," said Lifelong Business Chairman-in-Chief.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your friends and children: you won't be ready to take care of your family unless you tell them your wishes before the time.
Let your advisor and your family discuss where and how to care, because they can be important factors in determining the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also suggest ways to pay for those things.
For long-term care, a long-term care policy, a hybrid-value life insurance policy can be included as long as you have money.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
The authorities reported that on Friday, at least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
After the communication was closed, the rescue officers were unable to obtain any information from the Regents, the northern area of Palu, near the subcentre of a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were expelled in defeat.
Here are some of the main facts about the island of Sulavisi:
Palu Central Salvador is the capital of the province, with a population of 379,800 estimated in 2017, located on the west coast of the island of Salvador.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was still in its 40th year.
The mountain is a regency on the west coast of the island of Salvador, which is more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) in the area.
The population of 299 is estimated at the bottom of the administrative district, 200 in 2017.
The main foundation of the central Salvadorian economy was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of the mountain.
The unique mining in the region is also very important, but it is focused on the walls in Morovlia against the maximum solution.
In Indonesia, according to the Alpha Agency, Sunami has signed several times in the last 100 years in Palu and the mountains.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed because of tsunamis in the mountains and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, Sunami also signed in the western mountain, where nine people were killed.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire from a geographical point of view and regularly kills earthquakes.
In recent years, there have been reports of major earthquakes and tsunamis:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of a region of Indonesia hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, half of them.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes also attacked the western walls of the region at the beginning of March and April.
Hundreds were killed on the surface of the island of Nineveh, on the wall of the South.

More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: The 7.5 earthquake on the island of Manatwei on the coast affected the area, resulting in the destruction of villages in the area up to 10 metres away in Sunami and about 300 people killed.
2016: The earthquake in one of the waters struck Pidja Regents, which caused destruction and destruction because it caused people to remember the terrible earthquake of 2004 and the destruction or destruction of tsunamis.
This time no loudspeaker came, but more than 100 people were killed by falling into buildings or buildings.
2018: On the tourist island of Indonesia of Lonbok, severe earthquakes destroyed everything, including more than 500 people killed, most of the island north.

Sarah Pelin’s eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Pelin, former Alaska governor and deputy president hopeful of attacking Sarah Pelin's biggest son.
Vasila, 29-year-old Pelin of Alaska, was arrested on Saturday, according to a report released by Alaska State, in the doubt of domestic violence, to deal with domestic violence reports and to oppose arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman known to be trying to call the police to report a alleged crime, she took her phone.
According to KTUU's report, Pelin was sent back to the Mott-su Priestry facility and also sentenced to an unsecured bond of $500.
The Network's report reported that it was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "no fault" upon being asked for reasoning.
Pelin faced three A-grade offenders, where he could have been sentenced to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a day's sentence in prison and with a fine of $2,000 under Class B.
This is not the first time that criminal cases have been filed against Pelin.
In December 2017, he was convicted of attacking his father Todd Pelin.
Their mother, Sarah Pelin, called the police to report the attack.
At present, this case is before the court of Alaska's experienced persons.
In January 2016, he was charged with the arrest of domestic violence, the arrest of domestic violence reports, and the possession of a weapon in connection with alcohol abuse.
Her friend accused her of being locked up on her face.
After joining his son's violent behavior with PTSD in Iraq, Sarah Pelin was praised by a group of experienced people in 2016.
Earthquake tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people were killed
On Friday, at least 384 people were killed after earthquake attacks on the island of Indonesia.
7.5 The earthquake triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
In the coming days, the death rate was not working with Saat Electricity and the communications network.
The earthquake attacked the country's capital, Indonesia, in the north-east of Jakarta.
Videos showing influence on social media were happening.
When the sound of the trumpet came on the wall, thousands were gathered together to the midst of the city of Palu, to the place of the feasting.
The U.S.Missites are demanding the death penalty for the incident of the NYC attack.
In New York, U.S.A., U.S.A., is calling for a painful death penalty for Safulo Zipov, a fatal penalty for an internal attack on New York City that has killed eight people -- a virtual penalty that has been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Zipov, 30 of October, uses a home depot truck to attack a bike on the Western highway in lower Manhattan, using paddle travel and bicycles.
According to information to the intention to request the death penalty in the South of New York City, in order to properly justify the death penalty, Cypriots must prove that they have "consciously" killed eight victims and "consciously" physically injured them."
These two countries are probably sentenced to death according to the court document.
After one week of the attack, a U.S. Grand Jury beat Cyprus out of Chanta for 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder in Raktiriing, which were used by the United Nations in cases of organised crime and in cases of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
Employers said the attack needs to "discover enough planning and advance thinking", explaining the way in which Cyprus has resulted in the attack in "disgusting, cruel and evil" way.
"Safulou Habiblovic Sipoov injured and damaged friends and families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves Enlor Daket, Daren Drake, Ariel Eleger, Hernán Faruki, Aaron Diego Mendoza and Elozandro Pagunko," the welcome said.
Five of the patients were from Argentina.
The trial on the last death sentence in the South Gulf of New York has been ongoing for a decade.
Malijim Khalid Bran was found guilty of the murder of two drug providers, but ended in September 2009 with the punishment of Nursing Karav.
In 1953, the death penalty was last heard in the New York Union case for Julius and Itel Rosenburg, a married couple who were convicted of coercing the Soviet Union during the first two years of the century war.
John Rossenburg was sentenced to death by the Electric Course in June 19, 1953.
A local resident of Uzbekistan, Cyprus, has had no glamour or regret for days or months after the attack, according to the court documents.
The police said he told the investigators that everything he did pleased him.
Zipov told the authorities that he was moved to attack the ISIS video after seeing his phone.
Police said he also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He asked not to be guilty of a 22-counter crime.
David Patton, a representative of Cyprus, is one of the public defenders who say they are "clearly disappointed" in the decision of the employee.
"We think that, without any possibility of being released, the death penalty will only stop the mental attack of these events, rather than accept a life sentence," Patton said.
The security team in Cyprus told the first employees not to ask for a death penalty.
Tori MP says that the Private Faraz should be made an agent for a brief conversation.
Nigel Faraz swore that during the clash in Tori Conference, he had sworn 'to gather an army of people'.
The former bishop leader told politicians to "understand the environment" from Euroskeptics -- because one of the MPs in Theraesa May himself suggested that they should talk to the European Union.
The Rufusist Backbencher Peter Bon told March in Burma that if Mr. Faraz Brexit was sober, Britain would have been out by now.
But the challenges faced in solving their highly divided rankings by Mrs. Tori have been underlined by the Pro-Rhimen Tori to add a different opposition to the city against Brexit.
Prime Minister Brexitier, Reminers and the European Union are fighting to keep his checkmate plan on track during the attacks.
The co-workers urged that she would try to argue with Brussels instead of Backlash - and pressure Euroskeptics and employees to choose between their package and their intelligence.
Mr. Bone said that leaving means leaving the rail in Solihal, where he wants to 'send the cheques'.
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should become a partner and be given the responsibility of talking to Brussels.
"If he were a preacher, we'd be out by now," he said.
The MP or Sansad of Wellingboro said, 'I'll stand for the brexit, but we need to get the cheques out.'
Setting it up in the European Union, they said, "We do not need to be subjected to any of the world's wars."
We want to make our own laws in our country.'
Mr. Bon has taken advantage of all the suggestions that have changed the public opinion since 2016: 'The idea that British people have changed their views and want to live is completely false.'
Tori Brexitier Andria Jenkin also said in March: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister G, listen to people.
'The Czechs are not popular among the public, the foreigner will not argue because they are not so popular between our party and our activists that actually surround the streets and exclude us in the first place.
Please leave the checkers and start listening.'
In a central message for the rich, they said: "The prime minister keeps his employees when they do not break their promise."
Mr. Faraz said that Rally's leaders should be 'informed about the environment' if they cheat with the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
He said, "This is now the case between our people and our political classes."
'They're trying to deceive the brexit and today we're here telling them, 'We won't let you run away.'
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, they said, 'I want you to create our political class, who is in charge of misleading Brexit, understanding the environment.
'We are organizing the army of the people of this country who has given us victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a free, independent and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, within the city of Reminrs, marches from Burmagham for two hours before rolling in the middle of the city.
A group of actors pointed out Toriz against the Brexit Banner after the launch of this weekly group.
Leber Pierre Adonis points out to talk about the security problems that will occur with the party app at the opening of the Lord Adonis Conference.
'These are the people who tell us that they have the right IT system for Canada, the defenseless limit and the Irish border for free trade and all technology.
'It's a complete joke.
There's nothing like a good brief, he said.

Russian Grand Prix: Luis Hamilton finished the world title after winning the team at Sebastian Bethel
Then it became clear that the Valtery Bots should play a major role in the team's Order Race on Saturday.
From Paul, Bots started a good start and expelled Hamilton because he first built his place in two blocks and invited Bethel to join their team's drivers.
The hotel first went to Pitts and left Hamilton behind the package in traffic, something that should be decisive.
Mercides was behind a lap and came out behind the hotel, but Hamilton went on after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the driver of the Fari escapes from a third corner without any shock.
Max Verstation started from the last line of the grid and was on the holiday at the end of his 21st birthday.
Then he went on to a large part of the race, when he noticed that his tire had been changed, and he hurried forward from Kimi Raconen in the fourth place.
In the end, he entered Pitts on the 44th lap, but the rest was unable to increase his speed in eight laps, when Reconen reached fourth position.
It was a difficult day when Walteri did very good work all week and is a really good man.
Team got one-two and showed a great show, Hamilton said.
It was really bad.
President Donald Trup lied to Senator Dean Finnstein on Saturday at his request, he did not close the letter from Christine Blesi Ford, in which he charged the alleged murder of the Supreme Court with a Yon-Supposed Bret Kwangua.
While speaking in a rally in West Virginia, President Sinet's speech was not directly addressed by the forum of the Senate Judicial Committee, instead of commenting on the current situation of the Sinet, he said that people are "unreasonable and evil and disloyal."
"In the last few days in the screen, a very good thing or something that can happen, when you see anger, when you see angry people, angry people, mean people and mean people, and dishonest people.
"When you see release and Lik, they say, "Hey, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dean Finnstein, did you do it?
His answer is... did you get the document -- "Oh, oh, what?
Hey, no.
I didn't do it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we close... No, we didn't, he said to the sinter.
Finstein was sent a letter about the charges brought against Kuwaiti return in July and was filed at the beginning of September - but Finstein refused to have it removed from the office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn't close his story," Finstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"He told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he said."
But the president did not accept his rejection, who commented on Saturday night's radio: "I told you it was really bad weather.
He may not have done it, but I may have seen it before."
The Supreme Court's hope that three women, who have been charged with rape by John, would continue to defend themselves, told the president that the Democrats were using charges on their own.
"They are determined to take back power from any necessary means.
You see their meaning, corruption, and also that they don't care who they hurt or who they're running to get power or power or control," the media reported President's words.

Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crowni took the home side level before they were resettled.
Frankos Boshard compared it to Dandi before winning two rounds by Lucas Lundwalt Neilson.

Air Traffic Controller was killed to ensure hundreds of people could escape the earthquake
In Indonesia, an air traffic controller is hailed as a hero or nuancer, since he was killed to make sure hundreds of people were taken safely to land.
On Friday, more than 800 people were killed and more were missing after the main earthquake, activating tsunamis on the island of Sulavisi.
And the following plagues were perpetually destroyed in the field: and there were many that were carried away captive by the hand of Molech in the city of Palu.
But when his associates were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Egg refused to leave his post frequently controlled at Matira Sis Al Jafferi Airport Palu Airport.
He was there to ensure that the daughter Air Flight 6321, then on the run, could safely descend.
Then he went off the traffic control tower, when he thought it was gonna fall.
Later they died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman, Johannes Cirtret, said that hundreds of people could survive this decision, ABC News from Australia reported.
We have prepared a helicopter from Globalisation to take them from another city to a large hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost them before we reached the Helicopter Palace.
"They broke our heart," he said.
Meanwhile, officials are afraid that the number of people who die with the destruction of the country can reach thousands, the alpine agency says that access to mountains, lakes and botanists is limited.
"The rate of death can still be increased because many dogs can still be forced into the remains or mud, or in many places where they can't be reached," said Soltopo Ugarho, director of the agency.
The high waves beat down the Palu, and on the same day they were buried.
The military and commercial aircraft are bringing assistance and supplies.
Lisa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Skye News: "Every minute the Ambules came with the dogs.
It's hard to find clean water.
They were snatched away by a small band.
Jan Galfand, head of International Red Cross, told CNN: "Indonesia Red Cross is running to help the living, but we don't know what they're going to get there.
It's already a disaster, but it could be worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, arrived on Sunday and told the country's army: "I'm asking you to work day-to-night to complete all the related tasks by getting out or emptying out of the country.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
In Indonesia, about 550 people were killed at the beginning of this year in Lobunk.
Micronesia Airport Accident: Air Nuegini now reports that a man is hiding after the plane crash.
Airline, who is handling an accident plane in the Pacific Ocean in Macedonia, now says that a man is missing when it was last reported that 47 passengers and a crew of cruises or drivers had been safely evacuated.
Air Niugini told Saturday afternoon in a release that it did not find a man to travel.
Airlines said he was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
Airline travel does not respond immediately to the demand for information about the airline, such as its age or nationality.
While trying to get down to the wrong island airport when the plane crashed into the water, local ships helped to save other passengers and drivers.
The authorities told Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
Airlines said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and all of them are now stable.
It's the reason for the crash and what happened.
Airline and America say the two planes didn't land properly on the Runve.
Some of the witnesses or witnesses thought that the plane didn't land on the plane.
U.S. Traveler Bill Jean said the plane was very low.
Jane said, "This is a very good thing."
Jane said that she and others were expelled from deep water from the emergency exit when they were drowning.
He said that the aircraft workers were terrified and crying, and he was struck with a stroke on his head.
America Nosena said that the sailors working around to improve the damage also helped to save people in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water before drowning.
The Evolution Security Network data indicates that 111 people were killed in the PNG-registered Airlines crash in the past two decades, but no one was included in the Aviation.
The analyst described the time of the night when the woman was burned alive
The accession party restored its hair on Saturday to condemn a man in charge of burning an Egyptian woman alive in 2014.
The department of the U.S. Justice Analyst Paul Rolet presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of analysis.
He told Zuri how he had used the phone record to bring together the activities of the 19-year-old victim named Qutton Teles and 19-year-old J. Chamber on the night of his death.
Rolett said he got the location data from a number of cell phones, which shows that the death toll was with Tellis Chambers, the Clarian-Lazer reported, breaking his previous claims.
When the data showed that when he said he was with his friend Michelle Sanford, his cell phone was next to Chambers, the police told Sanford.
Sanford went on Saturday and presented his statement and evidence that he was not in the city that day.
When asked by the employees that if Talis was telling the truth, when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said, "He was lying because his truck was in Nashville."
The second difference was that Talis said that he had known Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cellphone records show that they knew each other only for a week.
Rolett said that shortly after the death of the Chamber, Talis removed all text or message, call or contact information from his phone.
He said, "He destroyed him from his life."
The rescue party is ready to start its completion argument on Sunday.
The judge said, "They were expecting to go to the jury that day."
High Bridge: What is the alert or alert hip hop?
The hip hop splint wants to change the negative view of style to fill positive messages in its music.
High Brad from Bristol claimed that hip-hop has drifted from its base to deal with political messages and social issues.
They wanted to get away from their roots and make the popular hip-hop again.

When a New York girl complains by a mother that she is "the other black person", she judges for a periphery after texting a biased flag.
Aged couples deny that they're racist, running a trial for "entrenchment".
Linci Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, discovers that Gisal Morris, the caretaker of the new children, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
"No other black person," Mrs. Plasco Flaxman told her husband in a text.
Although, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Sister Morris twice.
According to a New York Post, after realizing his forgetfulness, a "absolute" plasma-flexman expelled Sussry Morris, stating that their outgoing African-American girl had done bad things and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris was sent home to Ober to pay for her one day's work.
Now, Morris asks for $350 per day to get out of work and six months, although he was assigned to work in Liv-in-Giga without any connection.
"Look, I want to show them that you don't do anything like this," they said, "I know this is prejudice," he said on Friday in a post.
The young lady said on the charges that she was a nationalist, stating that after she was humiliated, they could not trust her, it was proper to end the Maurice newspaper.
"My wife sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a terrorist.
We are not atheists, "the husband that Plasco told the post.
But can you give your children into the hands of someone whom you have ever been ashamed of, even if that is the case?
A Child in Your Youth?
Leave it."
As in the case of the "enforcement", Plasco said that his wife had only been born for two months and he was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you following any of these?
It's not right to do that," Banker said at the entrance.

The Pakistani publishers are confident that the reader will not add it to his own thoughts and opinions, and the new letter reveals it.
Band's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born after the book was accepted, said in a letter: "It's hard to think of putting someone in place for the first time before it was published.
It's amazing to know about Pandington's success."
Referring to his father, who had been inspired by a small piece of music before writing a children's book as a BBC cameraman, he was hopeful to deny his work, he said that both were "happy and lost" in the 60th anniversary of the publication of their book after his death.
About Paddington, about whom she describes as "the important member of her family", she says that her father was proud of his possible success.
"They were a quiet man, and they weren't proud at all," he said.
"But because Pandington was very real to them, it was almost like you have a child who gets something: you're proud of them, though you're not actually doing it.
I think they've seen the success of Paddington that way.
Even though their designs were such that they would always give thanks to him.
My daughter was dying and I had to call her on the phone
When he landed, his daughter was taken to 2 Luis Pastor Hospital in Nice, where the work done by doctors was lost.
"Nade was regularly saying that it was really bad, he didn't expect that," said Mrs. Edenen-Lapurus.
"Furnad called me and told me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to call her Elvis.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, son.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctor’s medication to beat her heart was slowly ending up leaving her system.
She would have died a while ago, and all of it would have been closed.
I just had to sit there and wait, even knowing that it's gonna end.
I couldn't do any thing to groan, or to cry, or to weep, because I was surrounded by my family's people.
I had to take care of them all."
Finally, Mrs. Edenen-Lapurus, who suffered the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other travelers, who were unaware of the situation they were going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had my head down and I was crying all the time.
It was difficult to express, but I found the feeling of so much compassion for Nad on the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Postcards of women suffering from suicide on the bridge
Two women, who lost their loved ones to death, want to keep others alive.
Sharon Davis and Kali Hoffrey post cards and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge, which people can call for help.
Mr. Davis' son was 13 years old when he was suffering from depression and committed suicide in his 18 years of age.
"I don't want any mother to feel the way I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Mr. Davis, living in Lidney, said his son was a Honhar Chief who was spreading his smile everywhere.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
And they used to say, “He has control over all things.”
Although he left his work before he died, and was in a room of darkness.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then looking for his missing brother or sister in his 11 years of age, committed suicide.

And on the day of the Christmas, when the children opened their gifts, they were not able to see.
He said that his death was a big step for him, but they had to get out of it: "He left the family inside.
It hurt us.
But we all had to go ahead and fight."

The future of Kwangua was undermined when the FBI began testing.
"I thought, if I could really find something that he's looking for -- a limited time and a limited range of tests -- maybe we'll get some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and also that they're afraid that the committee between the charged privileged gridlock is "broken."
Why did Mr. Kwangua and their Republican supporters want to test the FBI?
It was because of their bad times.
The mid-election was only five weeks away, and on November 6th -- as expected, Republicans display very bad, they would be seriously weakened in their efforts in the high court they wanted to live on the ground.
George Dblu takes the phone to call the Bush Senator, preaches them to support Mr. Kwangua, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through them meet his wife, Ashley, who was the private secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happened after submitting your report by the FBI?
There will be a settlement in Sinnet, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not clear that Mr. Kwangua can have at least 50 votes on the Synet Flore, who had to finish it and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korean mines have been hit by a 'floor'
North Korea in South Korea fell seven years ago when John-on came into power, a South Korean regulator said.
Referring to the union of the Southern Ministry, Park Beyong-Sciam said that 1,127 people have fled their duty last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the high rates imposed by the strong border between North Korea and China were the main factors.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
A large number of refugees from the north are finally proposed for the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war since 1953.
The largest Chinese fled, with the longest border with North Korea and easy to cross the protected protected area (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China considers the refugees to be an illegal resident, and often sends them back to their country by force.
The relationship between the north and the south - still technically in the war situation - has been improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries are meeting in Pyongyang for talks, focusing on unrestrained nuclear talks.
It became active after the historic meeting between President Donald Trup and Singapore in June, when they provide extensive consent to the conditions for working towards the free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, Foreign Minister Rei Yang-ho of North Korea blamed US restrictions on the decline in progress.
"Without any faith in America, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, we will have no way of first bringing each other apart from harming ourselves," Mr. Ray said in a speech at the United Nations summit in New York.
Nancy Pelory called Brett Kwangua "major," he said he wasn't entitled to the Supreme Court.
The Haus Alpomt leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court's expected Bret Kwangua "major" and said that he is not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on a witness at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I can't imagine a month could show like this, they call it "major," Pelosi said to Thursday in response to the witnesses from the Cynette Judicial Committee.
Kwangua emotionally refused charges that she had ever tried Dr. Christine Blesse Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his initial statement, Kwangua was very emotional, sometimes speaking about his family and his school years crying and stopping his sleep.
They clearly condemned them by the giftists on the committee, proving that they were mythical to the charges of the "Victory and Related Character" that were angry about the loss of the 2016 President of the Hillary Clinton.
Pelosi said he believes that the Witnesses in Kuwait have proved that they cannot work in the Supreme Court because it shows that they are against the Democrat.
"I think they were wrong with those things and the way he went to Clinton and Democrat," he said.
Pelosi questioned whether this would be the case if the Congolese were established and if the Democrats were to gain prominence at the meeting, would it still be guilty of the Congolese?
"I'll say that -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not right for the Supreme Court, but because he's invited, he can work right now," Pelosy said.
Kwangua is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible rules of the Kuwaiti regime against the cheap maintenance of Act or Ro.V.V., because they are known to be law-makers.
In response to his approval, Kwangua ignored questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"In hearing his conviction, he ignored the questions that were raised by Kwangua if he would reverse some of the judgments of the Supreme Court.
And women need to move it.
It's a religious ax, the anger of months and years comes out and she can't stop herself from crying.
Mrs. Stemin said 45 years later to me, "When we cry, we get angry."
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She said, "A woman helped me a lot, who works for an officer, who says that even when she gets angry, she cries, but she has developed a new technique, which means that when she gets angry and she starts crying, she will say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she was talking.
And I thought that it was a very good thing."
The tears are allowed to go out as part of anger because they are basically misunderstood.
An early job, a man of my chief office, is one of the driest memories of me, when I found myself in an unbearable anger, and found that an old woman had grabbed my neck from the back -- a thug manager that I was always a little scared of -- who had dragged me in the stairs.
He said, "Never cry in front of anyone."
"They don't know how high you are.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy with them."
Patricia Schroeder, the president of a Democratic Congress from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested in a boat or in the name of Manki Business, and his name was taken back from the race, Mr. Schroeder, who was very disappointed, decided to take part in the presidential race himself.
"It wasn't a thought-making decision," he said, laughing at me after 30 years.
"There were already seven other hopes in the race and the last thing they needed was another hope.
Someone called him "Sno White and Saven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had been delayed, he had no time to collect money and therefore swore that he would not take part in the race until he had collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters who had given the men $1,000 would only give him $250.
"Do they think I've got any freedom?" she was surprised.
When he made his speech as he announced that he would not launch any formal campaign, he could not overcome his feelings -- thank you for the people who accompanied him, for the system that made it difficult for him to collect wealth and for the interest of the delegates, and for the frustration and the frustration of the sexist.
"You'd think I'd have a nervous break down," Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the press would have reacted to them.
"You'd think Cleenix was my corporate projector.
Do I remember what they would do to make my decision?
"She cried?"
How America-China's trade can be good for war beeing
Trade between America and China was about to slow down the initial war, and while the war is far from over, the gap between countries can benefit from sowing in the long term, experts said.
U.S. President Donald Trup said that the Chinese chief, including solar panels, steel and aluminium, had been exported and warned first in the beginning of this year.
The most important increase in this week is the most significant increase in the items from 200 billion (150 billion pounds) to about half of the supplies from China to the United States.
Beijing has always resisted in its own way, most recently from five to 10 percent of the US dollar's 60-billion-dollar-dollar sleeping traffic.
China has promised to join the US Shot-Shot, and the world's second largest economy is likely to be fast.
To get Washington back is to cover the demands, but it would be very embarrassing for the President of China to head towards the United States in public.
Still, experts say that Beijing can do its own thing, that trade in the United States of America can positively support China's long-term interdependence with two economic systems.
"It is true that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create situations that either start economic telespin in the country, which is actually more dangerous than previously seen by viewers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia for a thought tank.
Syrian refugees are ready to return, Foreign Minister said
Syria said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly in Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al-Molom said that the situation in the country is improving.
"The situation on the ground is more stable and secure because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism today," he said.
The government continues to return to areas destroyed by terrorists to restore the general situation.
There are now all the circumstances for the voluntary return of refugees to the country due to terrorism, and the inter-financial arrangements that highlight their daily life and livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian shares have been lost since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country still need human assistance.
Al-Molam said that Syria would welcome help in rebuilding the lost country.
But they insisted that this rebellion would not support or accept aid from developing countries.
Europe wins a rider in Paris
Europe's team won the 2018 Rider Cup of Harakar by the US team from 16.5 to 10.5 on the outside of Paris, Le Golf National.
America has now suffered a six-fold defeat on the soil of Europe and has not won a rider cup in Europe since 1993.
When Captain Thomas Jordan's captain reaches the 14.5 points needed to beat Tin American, Europe regains its credibility.
U.S. Star Phil Michaelson, who fought most tournaments, accepted a match from Francesco Molinary and showed his t-shot in water at the 3rd floor.
The Italian Golfer Molinary won one of the four players to win all rounds after the current Tournament format began in 1979.
The US Jordan Speth was defeated by the lowest player in the European team, Torbzon Oleson, Denmark, from 5th and 4th.
The world's top football player, Dustin Johnson England, lost from Lane Polter 2 and 1, who was probably playing his last rider copy.
One of the eight riders, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become a European winner in tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop myself today.
It was a tough year.
So thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm so glad I got help," Greece said emotionally after winning Europe.
He beat his friend John Ram, who lost the American Golf Legend Tiger Wood from 2 and 1 on Sunday in a single play.
And 23 years old, Rehomb said, "I feel like I'm losing my tiger's wood, and I'm very proud to see them."
They lost all four matches in Wood France, and now they have 13-21-3 Carrier Reader Copy Record.
So far, one of the biggest players has only won 14 major prizes after Jack Nicolas.
America's team fought for full weeks with the exception of Patrick Read, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finneu, who played golf with full caliber in the whole tournament.
"I'm proud of these boys, they fight.
In the morning we'll put some pressure on Europe.
We saved them.
Thomas, welcome.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played a very good game.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA and the Reader Copy Committee of America and move forward with Thomas.
I like these 12 boys very much and I'm proud to be their captain.
You should welcome them.
We have made the best to play.
