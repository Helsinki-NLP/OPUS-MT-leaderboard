I had nothing to do with it.
We're both very hungry.
We have a lot of friends.
I don't think I'm ready for the investigation.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
They'll fix him.
We don't have school tomorrow.
Rome wasn't built in one day.
I like dancing.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We didn't have any secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I got a green shirt.
You're much faster than I am.
Tom lives in Australia now.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that.
Good morning.
Do you like the juice?
You seem disappointed.
Tom knows everything about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We laugh a lot.
Tell me what you're going to do in the exams.
I don't think two languages are enough.
Can you lend me your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter is a nurse.
I think we should talk about it.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church with the car.
You're much smarter than I am.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's coming home at three.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I'm not gonna lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
The shoulderfish isn't my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a student of high school Jutsu.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with that.
They're lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
It's okay?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I know where you work?
Can anyone explain that to me?
Who is she?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We found the house green.
The time and place of the meeting have been closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I've been promoted recently.
Milly doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please close the door.
Squad's doing good health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary he had to.
What would you tell her to do?
He's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I'm sorry.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
Everything that lights is not gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
It hits my phone.
Throw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom is a head taller than I am.
Where can we buy it?
Now it's 2:30.
Everyone knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was in his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadian.
Who's that?
Tom forgot his bag in the middle of the train.
They killed our hostages.
My name is not Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a hippie community.
The water's hot.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes running.
Tom didn't want to touch you.
It was an emergency.
You're wearing a lot of scissors.
Is anyone here yet?
Tom is the only Canadian here.
Tom will live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canada?
People today attach more importance to people's culture than to the past.
Tom's not my friend anymore.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you shave your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We love each other.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
You shot him?
We may need some.
This is a proposal.
How did you get through the holidays?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
I'm here!
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find you.
You're called?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house is completely destroyed.
Tom got Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who he is?
Did you see the baseball on TV last night?
Mary took pictures of her mother with her cell phone.
I wanted to die.
The same is true of me, whether it comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about money.
Would you like to see them?
You ruined him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like humans.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I'm not gonna be late.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
Are you 18?
I want to do sports.
Tom was alive.
Tomma's phone hit, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was extra-free.
About.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myths?
It's over 40.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
Our captain has set us well.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw it with romantic poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom hugged Mary.
You wouldn't go to Australia to build a store?
What do you call that?
Larry's still at school.
My office is in the center of town.
He's got two sisters.
You're not Canada.
I visited Boston years ago.
Tom rejected Mary.
Tom has a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We stayed in Boston for three nights.
I'm starting to find you tired.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom wears gloves.
The letters are written by the girl.
Someone's been screaming.
He didn't go to the lake.
He speaks directly to the French.
I'm taller than you.
Have you lost the evidence?
Are you afraid of losing your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom will be back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm invincible.

We're very busy.
Harder, please.
You're mine.
Please breathe from your nose.
The company canceled the plan.
"Fire!" he called.
He worked hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm gay.
You're easy.
He's not a hero, Tom.
I'm happy to be able to help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys aren't mine.
She was the last customer.
Do you like white wine?
They made a mistake.
I say it and I say it again.
Open the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
Do you learn Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That's not gonna happen again.
Russia is big.
The teacher is friendly.

Look what I can do.
You can't do anything.

Everybody ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I'm reading it.
I want to talk to Tom.

Tom is Turkus.
Can you get rid of the ten or six?
Don't stop!

Tell her it's an emergency.

I know.
I broke up in tears.
He's talking like a truck.
When do you read?
He hasn't answered yet.

Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a body?
I'm grateful for what he's done.
And I'm kind of tired.
Are you sure you don't think things?
Don't quit.
He's walking slowly.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
His father is Japanese?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you hit the last button?
Tom was dangerous.
What time does it start?
I'm in now.
I'd think about it.
Tom's from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
This would never happen in Boston.
I like playing piano.

You're impatient.
You're impatient.
What did you promise to do?
I didn't take part in the debate.
Note: In English we celebrate nationalities, days of the week, and languages.

You were guilty.
I trust you.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build stores?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
My name is Kirillos; I'm glad to meet you!
He's got good legs.
His current behavior confirms what we assumed.
You'll eat.
The problem is you're not a Canadian.

Tom's asleep.
Is he coming?
Tell us where to go.
Sam had a shower and had a bath in Lila's bathroom.

His money's in the bank.
I'm very shy.
I love my country.
We went to a serious discussion.
They're here.

What are you reading?
Okay, thanks.
Only I can save you.

She must be sick.
I'm shy.
We'll make a visit to our friends.
It's a frequency check.
And talking about genocide, it's Columbus Day.
Sam took another camera.
I want some orange juice.
The entrance of the toilet is very dirty.
Is Tom from Boston?
Do we really have to leave now?
Would you like some coffee or tea?
Tom, I'm afraid we'll find our end.
Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of poems.
They voted.
He wrote the book.
I haven't given it to Tom yet.
You're still alive.
I'll never forget that night.

Tom said he thought I was impressed.
I drink at least once a month.
I want to have some cheese.

Answer the question.
The problem is you're not Canadians.
I'll be in the car.
What's the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I lost the last two lessons.
I'd like him to give me an explanation.
Where did you learn to speak French?
Tom failed.
Open your book on page ten.
This elevator is out of operation.
There were so many people in the room that after violence I could move.

We're gonna kill you.
You're old enough to do it yourself.
"What would you like?" "I'd like a dog."
You work hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's really a good theory, the only thing I think it's probably common in all philosophical theories, it's wrong.
Why don't I stay surprised by that?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He spends a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm very nervous now.
I thought you were Japanese.
There's a lot of fascination here.
Who saw you?
They're bigger than that.
Please repeat what I'm saying.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
The language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike's the highest of three.
You asked them to wait?
She's crying.
It'll work.
I guess you're Canadians.
Yeah, I know.
Will Tom die?
I'd like to go see a movie.
A lot of questions remain.
I like Irish music.
Give me a cup.
What's your height?

Here?
Where did you find the key?
Could that be wrong?
Tom can't stand the warm and wet summers here and that's why he went to the mountains.
Bill, take the phone at night.
I'll help in any way I can.
Please tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
It's Italian, isn't it?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
There were many pornographic magazines in his room.
Let's leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Thank you.
Are you awake?
Algeria is very different from the United States.

I brought you something.
I did as I was asleep.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We've had it.
Tom was impressive.
H Mary is protective of strangers.
We're gonna shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I came home.
Life is hard.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy you.
Tom pushed the door.
This is where I live.
I hope you'll call again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Talk to you later.
Put the book above the others.
The bird's in the sky.
Tom hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom married Canada.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
You're sending a message?

We only have three options.
The Moon is behind the clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.

Tom's helping Mary.
He'll protect you.
Tom's driving.
My father is rich.
Are you new?
I remember that word.
I'll decide.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
It's not difficult for the French.
Someone's calling.
We found her.
Where are you sleeping?
His hair was brown.
Everything repeats the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Steven's dead.
We can't stop you.
What language did I speak in Switzerland?
Help me get him up.
Are they Japanese?
Why does he hate you so much?
Let Tom go to sleep.
Here and how long have you been a teacher?
Try to stay real.
This is a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before dinner.
Are you drunk?
He tried to write a lecture.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?
My father is missing.
Wait, I want to tell you something.
He's using you.
He's not back in Okinawa.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why did you kiss her?
I hope the bus route isn't boring.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
Tom beat Mary.
At first, I couldn't understand it.

How deep?
He likes music.
Don't they look happy to you?
We could see the sunset from the window.
One and a half, fresh water.

It's too late.
Do you like this flower?

This is not a justification.
It looks like a apple.
Good day, isn't it?
I thought you were Japanese.
The price of this car has a decrease of fifteen percent.
How are you?
Tom went to bed too late.
That's the absolute truth.

Can I help you?
It's easy for me to sleep when I watch TV.

The knife on the table wasn't much more expensive for the meat, so I used my soup.
I was lucky.
You're impatient.
He's got a white dog.
I just want to help you.
Tom's basically good at anything he does.

Your turn.
I didn't believe him until he came and talked to me in detail.
Read it.
That's the risk.

Is that gonna change?
I tried to hide my frustration.
I like both of them.
None of them speak French.

You're mine.
What exactly did you tell them?
Would you like to start?
I would like to learn all the European languages.
What's he going to order in the restaurant?
You have to listen to me.
Stop resisting!

Tom knew I was busy.
We'll find it.
I'm curious.
I'll eat here.
This is a Japanese doll.
He pulled out his glasses.
It's good to dream.
He had a headache.
Which one of them is mine?
Tom doesn't speak French.
I've gone to ten foreign countries so far.
You underestimated me.
Finally, these two are still being repaired.
I was crying.
I wasn't angry.
That's not my key.
You're a doctor.
My decision to study abroad surprised my parents.
The door is at the end of the route.

The neighbors are friendly.
My neighbor's dog is dead.
I'm still looking for Tom.
What did they say?
Do you need them?

First of all, he doesn't like to be called a big man.
Tom wanted answers.
They just left.
Tom is the boss of Marys.
Why are you so strict with yourself?
Tom's eating cat food.
The computer's new.
That book is written in French.
Tom's running fast.
Tom put his hands back in his pockets.
Tell him you lied.

Mary answers the teacher's question.
They wanted to steal the car.
You like my new shirt?
You'll be jealous.
What's the title of your new book?
We know each other pretty well.

I want to die.
Did you eat anything?
I guess you're better than Tom.
The city I grew up is very beautiful.
Tom's writing too fast.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
He'll understand.
They forgave you.
My father is the whole world.
Tom will be ready.
You guys seem busy.
They're talking about Tom?
I love Hotomi.
Do you want to be famous?
I forgot to buy flowers in Mary.
I'm not a professional.

Were you there?
It's working.
I don't like surprises.

We'll wait.
I think Tom has three choices.
We'll be together.

To our health!
We'll save you.

I went in.
Let's get him a drink.
I think he's innocent.
Who's your teacher?
Where's Tom eating this morning?

You destroyed him.
When did you get here?
I know myself very well.
We'll find one.
I told my friends.
I think we could help each other.
I live in Milan.
Tom wouldn't believe us.
Am I your friend?
I may admire other people, but I never tried to be someone else beyond me.
I don't trust women.
I suggest you read this book.
Can you find it?
Please correct the next proposal.
Tell me if I need to make some changes.

I'll be ready.
What are you gonna drink?
What color is your dress?
No one will know.

There were so many people in the room that I could hardly move.
He'll walk.
You're ready.
We recognized her.
She's having a meal.

And with others, I don't like wearing pants.
We're planning on joining your party.

It was English.
I had no doubt.
I'm not tired at all.
She's beautiful.
What do you want me to tell you?

I understand.
You're still alive.

We'll die if we stay here.
Do you want to eat shrimps?
I have a friend.
She didn't understand Mary's joke.
Are you gonna tell them?
She's very clever.
Who brought you here?
We had our vacations on the lake.

You're not poor.
We'll go visit Tom.
My colleague and I are doing the same job, but he was promised promotion very soon.

You have to write a letter.
Tell her I'm ready.
I'll wash the dishes.
I like snow, it's so nice!

We killed them.
You're so beautiful!

We don't want her.
This room is used as a kitchen.
Who are you referring to?

I'm diabetic.
He's kicking me!
When was the last time you smoked?
We all agreed with Tom.
Tom's house is close to the beach.
We're gonna build a wall.
That tea's good.
This is the last warning.
Give us three minutes.
You'll learn to speak English independently!
That's fantastic!
Say it in Hungarian!
I know his address.
I want to know when the meeting will start.
I know he's lying.
Actually, you're absolutely right.
Do you like white chocolate?
The snakes are flat.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
I'd like to visit the ancient Athens.

Can you see the stars tonight?
Ask him when the next plane leaves.
You're alive.
Look around.
Tom said he knew Mary's secret.
That's the absolute truth.
Did he admit it?
I paid someone to clean my house.
I'll cook you something.
We found them.
Mary knows what she's doing.

They didn't understand the question.

Tom bought a car in Mary.
It's almost summer.
I guessed it was right.
Tom studied in Boston.
I'll show you.
He wants to live in town.
I'll never see you again.

Did we win?
I'm not very good at this.
Were you alone?
I don't blame anyone.
I miss Tom.
I have to go to sleep.

You're bigger than me.
We're doctors.
You think you could help me get the vegetables out of the garden this afternoon?
Is Tom hungry?
I'm ready to go.
Who died?
Tom runs every day.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary had made that decision.
You're Canadians, aren't you?
I have to tell them.
Have you read this book?
Tell them I'm not here.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
That's right.
We're honest.
I woke up at 5:00.
Tell them we'll be ready.
Who taught you French?
Tom had a black cat.
I'll buy one.
Tom would never have done that.
Tom burned three candles.
We're gonna be killed.
You're sending him a message?
I'll show you the city.

Why would you do that?
He's lost in the woods.
How far is it from Brno?
Let's hope it works.
Tell them you're sick.
I was hiding.
He's a jackass, isn't he?
What are you gonna eat today?
Tom is Canadian.
Did you kiss?
We've been warned.
Tom's got a lot of thought.
Wait here.
In his eyes, it was perfect.
Can you find him?
He's strong, generous, and, rather, generous.
They're Canadians, aren't they?
I'll teach you French.

I was tired.
You were perfect.
Tell him how important it is.
Why exactly did you do that?
I'm eating.

I left the bank with empty hands.
Why don't you tell them?
Is she asleep?
Where's the school?

Are you crazy?
I'm very tired.
What do you want me to do?
Do you understand?

I'm going home today.
I have sunglasses.
We have the best food in the city.

Tell them I won't do that.
I'm not very good at this.
I was hoping to see Tom.
We're all Canadians here.
Tom made some mistakes in the test.
Tom's cooking.
I'm scared.
It's better to learn someone how to fish than to give him a fish.
I was so angry.
I get it.
Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom's gonna listen.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.
It makes me laugh.

Tom's too late.
How often do you eat outside?
I'm 19 years old.
When do you have a birthday?
Did you know Tom well?
I was in the right place at the right time.
Are you sure you've gone to the last button?
It's not hard to learn English.
The date will be set at a later date.
No one's coming.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I have a lot to do.
I punished them.
Your friend's here.

Meat?

I'm not your teacher.
I'll buy one.
I understand.
If you can, please follow me.
He started talking to the dog.
They all ran out.
They speak English and French in Canada.
It's crazy.
Tell them how important it is.
The party is Sunday.
We're all Canadians here.
Listen to her screaming.
Did Tom send you?
Tom laughed.
I've lost my style.
How does that word speak?
He saved me.
I got an idea.
Where's the bank?
Don't be drunk.
I'm expecting your help.
It's almost 2:30.
What is it?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.
Tom has black circles under his eyes.
We weren't talking about Tom.
They trusted you.
You think this is a game?

We're not gonna change anything.
Look what I did!

You have thirty days.

The Russian language is a Slavic language, spoken as a mother in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and is widely used, although without official recognition, in Latvia, Estonia and many other countries, which were the democracies of the former Soviet Union.
Tom said you were coming.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
I'm bigger than that.
Why don't you tell them?
I'm still trying to find Tom.
"How many years are you?" "I'm twenty-three years."
Get some water.
I wish I had been born in Canada.

Did you see who did it?

I don't know why Tom's not here.
He never forgets his money.
It's almost 20 years old.
You have to stay.

Are you angry with Tom?
My parents live a strange life in the countryside.
He lost all his money in the casino.
I love green peppers.
You made the same mistake.
She said she had a good look.
What are you gonna say to Tom?
Thomas found me.
We're very busy.
I can live without water.
We've given your command the highest priority.
We make mistakes sometimes.
Could I use it?
They killed her.
My car's dirty.
I have to tell you the truth.
You never trusted me.
