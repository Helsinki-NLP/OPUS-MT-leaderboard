How long have these symptoms been going on?
And all breasts should be handled in this way especially at your age
And along with the female
and blood pressure and cholesterol you also need to be checked
And are you in a fever now?
And do you feel these breasts now?
And do you also have difficulty breathing?
And can you tell me the other symptoms you've experienced together with this?
And how high is your fever ever?
And I'm also stuck.

Do you feel any other symptoms?
Have you ever felt a little nervous?
Do you still feel breast pain?
Because this is the flu season.
But we can't afford to have a brain that's from the heart.
But the more important problem now is the brain.
And I'm having trouble breathing.
But I know a lot of bad people in my direction.
but we have to deal with every brain that's very serious.
But now you can breathe well?
I really forgot the cause of the brain.

Cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) which increased rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary virus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar train in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK that confirms that, despite its varying degrees depending on the country, COVID-19 has developed very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, hospital, and intensive care units, it should increase its preparedness for the development of COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the Pneumonia cluster with etiology was reportedly unknown in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On January 9, 2020, the Control and Prevention Centre Tinkkok reported that this disease is a new coronary virus now called acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been called coronary disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far shows that about 80% of the COVID-19 sufferers have mild, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, with most of the suffering cured.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 has developed into a more severe disease and requires hospital care, while 6% of other cases have a critical disease that requires intensive care.
Patient mortality in the hospital due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we studied the COVID-19 cumulative incident train in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the UK (UK) and compared it with the incident in the Province of Hubei, Tiongkok.
We also compare the number of COVID-19 cases currently in the EU/EEA and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during January 31st–15 March 2020.
Case COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK
After Tiongkok, the COVID-19 experienced further geographical preaching and dynamics of the COVID-19 in the rest of the world, following the dynamics of the panzemi in Tiongkok.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020, published on 5 March, Spiterie et al. reported the first Europeans with the COVID-19 case confirmed on the basis of the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 by people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tigkok.
On 15 March 2020, the COVID-19 case was detected across 30 EU/EEA and British Rays (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020, with that date, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get my cumulative numbers and my cumulative incident in the COVID-19 case
At the European Disease Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported worldwide is updated every day at 8 a.m. This number is obtained only from official sources such as the National Health Authority, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to evaluate the COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compare it with the train in Italy.
As an active prevalence proxy for the COVID-19 case, we count the cumulative incidents of 14 days, so calculate the natural journey of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK, in the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also provided the number of cases that were notified to each country by 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. compared with the case of Italy during the period 31 January–15March 2020.
COVID-19 train in EU/EEA and UK
Cumulative incident train was held for 14 days in the EU/EEA and the UK generally followed the train in the Province of Hubei (Tigkok) (Gambar 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase by about 21 February, and then increased by 28 February 2020.
This train is mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported by Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a similar cumulative incident increase in COVID-19 (In addition).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA country and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data suggests that, by 15 March at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases compared to the total number of Italy's three weeks earlier or less.
The results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported increased rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The train watching the COVID-19 incident indicated that the pandemi increased at a speed comparable to that in all countries.
This is the result of the degree differences between countries, the variation in the response to public health, and the possibility of the differences in the definition of the country and the differences in protocol to choose the patient to be tested for the confirmation of the COVID-19, which includes a case-by-case examination.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the Italian region who explained the situation about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that the hospital and intensive care unit in the region had reached its maximum capacity.
Currently, data on COPID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA levels are available only for each 6% and 1% cases (data not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete the current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study carried out in 2010-2011 showed a significant variation in the availability of intensive care and nursing facilities in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 places of intensive care and nursing per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The model scenario is related to the lack of health care capacity, with estimates of the prevalence of COVID-19 cases of concern for each EU/EEA country and the UK of risk-related >90% over the sleeping capacity of intensive care, provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Because so far the most classified cases in certain EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units are usually serving a limited population of regional services, information on the case and intensive care facilities should be provided at the United Kingdom Regional Planning Levels for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and the current train in another country shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has developed very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of COPID-19 patients in need of health care, especially intensive care, as in the most affected area in Italy.
As shown in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive, and understanding approach is very important to slow down the SARS-CoV-2 preaching, with a change from a detachment approach to a sweetening approach, because a rapid increase in the number of cases, as expected, may not give sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the correct response if it is not previously applied.
The rapid risk assessment also outlines public health steps to mitigate the effects of pandemics.
There's a short chance window when the country has the chance to increase its control in slowing down SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the stress on health care.
If failure occurs, the health care system of another EU/EEA country may be faced by patients who need intensive care in a few days or weeks ahead.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Tigkok and elsewhere in the world, causing disasters for humans.
Mirip with its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from the vertebrae and caused similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Even so, COVID-19 has a lower rate of impatience and mortality than SARS, but more and more about the age of young people, and more on men than women.
As a response to the increasing number of publications on this recent disease, this article tries to provide timely and understandable guidance on the subject of rapid research.
We'll discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although many questions have not yet been answered, we hope that this move will help us to understand and fight this dangerous disease.
The Semi Festival, on January 25, 2020, has become an unprecedented memory for all Tinghoa people who were ordered to stay at home for vacations and a few weeks later because of a new virus disease.
This virus is very homologous with coronal virus (COV) that caused the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was given the name SARS-COV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, Tigkok, and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, this virus has caused 80,000 COVID-19 cases confirmed, with more than 40,000 patients being released and 3,000 patients died in the world.
WHO warns that the COVID-19 is an "enemy of number 1" and a potential to destroy more strongly than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report of January 7, 2020, which established a sequence of virus isolated from some patients, more than 200 has been published about COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
The goal is to include research progress in this fast - moving field of subjects.
At some point, we're going to try to compare the COVID-19 with SARS and the disease caused by other COVs, which is the Middle East breathing syndrome (MERS, 2012 plague).
We will also consider what we have learned so far about disease prevention and forecasting and some other questions that have not yet been answered, but they will be urgent.
Based on tradition, CoV is considered a nonletal pathogen for humans, especially causing about 15% of the 4th dose.
Even so, in this century, we've found a very pathogenic coV for humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing the initial plague in Tiongkok in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and immediately spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
That's why, COVID-19 is now the third coV plague in human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the Pneumonia cluster was originally not known for the first time from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of the Tigkok People’s Republic on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, a coV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan's first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20th, a health care infection was reported, indicating that human-human transmission could happen.
On January 23, the district quarantine was conducted in Wuhan and the general public was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study on this disease reported that, from 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients directly associated with the Wuhan marine food market were considered to be the first site of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared this plague an emergency of global health.
It is now reported that the disease has spread to nearly 50 other countries throughout the world.
Because the situation is developing very quickly, the end and end of the plague still have to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-faceted study in 8,866 patients, comprising 4,021 COVID-19 patients, provided a more up-to-date picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
SARS-COV-2 infected people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected over 50 years old, only a little under 20 years old, and only 14 people under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expands into the cluster, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 consumes an average time of 5 (2-9) days beginning from the mid-term to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time starts from dawn to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive count (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, according to the mass transportation time before the Semi Festival in Tiongkok.
Mortality in patients with confirmed cases total 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and mortality adjusted for all patients total 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are the type of male (man), age (≥60 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of a large virus assembled containing a single RNA cine.
CoV can be divided into four kinds, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-coV known to be human infections.
Glicoprotein tonol or spike (S) is also associated with its cell receptor, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) exchange enzyme and peptide 4 (DPP4) peptide each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The RNA gene is released into sitoplasms; after replication by virus, RNA genomics are combined with glucoprotein sampus and nucleocapside proteins form vesiculars filled with virion, which then experience fusion with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-COV-2 is a new beta-COV type with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98% of the 10 samples followed; the sample was taken from the base of the whale, called the Ocean Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-COV-2 is more similar to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
Through electronic transmission microscopy, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the very small human breath sequence of epithelium.
ACE2 humans were found to be a receptor for SARS-COV-2 as well as SARS-COV.
However, S SARS-COV-2 protein is associated with human ACE2 weaker than its binding to S SARS-COV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes non-separable infections of SARS-COV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein bounded with orf3b and a protein bounded with an orf8.
Orf3b SARS-CoV-2 protein may be active in viral pathogens and IFNβ expression inhibition; however, orf8 does not have a known functional or motive domain.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the entire human cryo-EM ACE2 structure in resolution 2.9 Å in complex with B0AT1 amino carrier.
They found that complex, which has open and closed conformation, is designed to form dimer and complex ACE2-B0AT1 can bind two S proteins, which is evidence of coV detection and infection.
B0AT1 can be developed as a therapeutic target in the drug insert to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and intermediate
SARS-COV and MERS-COV are known to come from the bay and each is transmitted to the human through the barrier and the ostrich.
By comparing the phylogenetic SARS-CoV-2 with the other coV, the vertebrate is considered to be the original source of the SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to the two coVs-similar-SARS of the vertebrate called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the mean waves that help the virus to prevent species from being infected are still unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be explained.
Ji, et al. produce snakes as a vector virus from the pelvis to humans involving homologous recombination in the protein S.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, Tiongkok, recommend that the caller, the mammary mammal mammal cognac long diet that is often used in the traditional Tionghoa medicine, is potentiated as a dome among SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homologies on the coV found in the caller and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1% of the differences spread throughout the genome are still a big difference; therefore, concrete evidence is not yet available (G. 3).
The physical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are not known in most cases.
In vitro, SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and a 40%-50% blackout.
SARS-COV-2 may have a similar quality.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and hot light at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, infection containing chlorine, acetate, chloroform, and other fats, but not chlorhexidine, effectively disables the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-COV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there is no detailed study that reports on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to another coV study previously, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).
In general, after ingestion, the virus is known by the immune system by means of a field control receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through a different route, the virus induces the expression of an inflammatory factor, dentric cell maturing, and the type I (IFN) interferon synthesis that limits virus preaching and accelerates the anti-fogousitis of the virus by macrophages.
However, the N protein on SARS-COV can help the virus avoid immune response.
Soon thereafter, the immune response is adaptive to join in the fight against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
Cell T CD4+ stimulates cell B to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and cell T CD8+ kills cells that are directly infected by the virus.
The T-cell helper produces proinflammatory cytokines to help protect the cells.
Even so, CoV can block the T-cell function by inducing the T-cell apoptosis.
Humor immunity, which includes supplements, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, is also important in combating viral infections.
For example, the isolate antibody from a patient who has been cured has been neutralized by Mers-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive immune response produced a large number of locally free radicals, which could cause serious damage to lungs and other organs, and, on the worst scenario, failure of an organ and even death.
SARS-COV-2 infection, marked with avitan cluster, is more about age with breast-feeding and pregnant women.
In general, people who are exposed to the virus in large numbers or whose immune function is disrupted have a higher chance of infection than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study on 1,099 cases shows that the average incubation period is 3 days and the empire starts from 0 to 24 days.
A new study, as explained above, shows that the incubation period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days is based on demographics of 8.866 cases.
Most important health authorities adjust effective quarantine based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent infected people, but without symptoms, transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people who are exposed to viruses or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended for up to 24 days?
Demam is often the primary and early COVID-19 symptoms, with or without other symptoms such as dry rock, breathing, muscle swelling, swelling, headache, joint pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after treatment with the disease.
In severe cases, the growth of the patient’s disease is rapidly becoming acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients who have a fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms, even if they do not have a lung cancer, should be prescribed for the diagnosis of the virus here.
Demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the proportion of symptoms was 98% for wheat, 76% for durum wheat, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diuresis; 8% of patients needed fan support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies, namely studies on family and cluster clusters caused by transmissions from asymptomatic people.
Compared with that, the 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also experienced fever (98%), dry dry (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, much more than the COVID-19 patient and are consistent with the MERS lethality higher than the COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and arthralgia (21%) also occur in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, dams (99%-100%), dry rock (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and burning disease (13-25%) were shown as the main symptoms and ventilation support needed for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Compared to that, SARS mortality in November 2002 accounted for 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed.
The previous study reported that R0 SARS-COV-2 reached 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-COV only crossed 2 to 4.
Compare SARS-COV-2 to MERS-COV and SARS-COV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given in Table 1.
These figures indicate that SARS-COV-2 has a higher wide range of capabilities than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but does not automate MERS-COV and SARS-COV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-COV-2 panmeal is greater than the MERS-COV panmeal and SARS-COV.
Avitan class is often found in one family or from one group or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or stay in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks prior to aviation.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who are removed from the hospital can carry the virus again, which leads to a cautionary increase in quarantine time.
At the initial stage, the patient has a white peripheral blood count (especially lymphocytes) normal or down.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte counts < 1×109/L, and aminotransferase aspartate and viraemia increased in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The incidence of enzyme and muscle and myoglobin increases in the blood of a number of patients, and the C-reactive protein and the blood count increases in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer increased, i.e. the product of fibrin recovery contained in the blood, and the lymphocyte count decreased progressively.
The difference in photo torrax was found in a large COVID-19 patient and marked with a bilateral wall shadow or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When the ARDS occurs, tater control inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis are greatly exacerbated by the disruption of gas exchange.
The type I and type II pneumatic function lowers surface and increases surface pressure so that it lowers lung capacity to develop and increases the risk of lung collapses.
Therefore, the worst finding of a torax is often parallel to the worst disease rate.
On 18 February 2020, the first COVID-19 pathological analysis showed pneumonia, the formation of hyalin membranes, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and the emotional cell involved a lot in the lung of patients who died of this disease, according to the pathology of virus and ARDS and the same with the pathological analysis of patients SARS and MERS.
RNA SARS-CoV-2 detects using the back polymerase transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used as the main criteria for the COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because of the high false negative rate, which can speed up the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends on RT-PCR) at Tiongkok on 13 February 2020.
Similar situations also occur in SARS diagnostics.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiology findings is very important and a need to make effective diagnostics.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the SHERLOCK-based technology-based protocol to detect SARS-COV-2, which detected synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-COV-2 at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using cell stick at less than one hour without needing complex instruments.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and ease if checked for clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with the new CoV, the doctor in particular offered support to the COVID-19 patient, while trying various therapies previously used or sent to other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This treatment includes current therapy and potential therapy with antiviral drugs, immunosuppression, steroids, plasma from patients who have recovered, Tinghoa traditional drugs, and psychological support.
Even plasma from a well-treated patient is recommended for use in therapy.
The pharmaceutical company is developing antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-COV-2 mainly attacks lung and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at lower levels, such as gastrointestinal system and kidney.
However, the operation and lack of breathing are the main threats to the patient and the main cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the level of disease disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the most modified cardiopulmonary technique used to treat heart failure or respiratory distress.
In addition, electrolyte care, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, and protection of vital organ function are also very important for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
An excessive immune response is known to cause cytokines in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response marked by the release of the cytokine sequence, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNg, and MCP-1.
These sitokins induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and failure of an organ.
Immunosuppression is very important in the handling of sitokin storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroid and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, has been used to handle the sitokin storm.
Other immunosuppression control for sitokin clouds includes modulation of the immune response to T-cells; blocking IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF; JaK inhibition; blinatumomab; implanting sitokin 4 signals; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the risk of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful for heavy lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids can cause side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which greatly affects prognosis.
Even so, short-dose corticosteroids are provided at low doses until they are encouraged to give careful attention to patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill.
At the time of this research, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, the provision of remdesivir intravenously, i.e. a nucleotide analogue, was found secretly in a COVID-19 patient from America.
Remdesivir is a new antivirus medicine developed by Gilead, again for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
In recent years, remdesivir also showed inhibition of RNA virus by other single viruses, including Mers and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead provided this life for Tionkok to perform a series of tests on infected SARS-CoV-2, and the results were very encouraging.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diare, nausea, vomiting, heart damage, and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from patients who have recovered and developed antibodies
There is a long history of patient blood collection that has been healed from a chronic illness to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent the affected person from being treated with it.
Indeed, a patient who has been healed often has a relatively high level of antibodies in his blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize the unique molecule on pathogen, and directly control it.
Based on this, plasma is collected from a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and are administered to 10 patients with severe disease.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, along with lowering the inflammation and the weight of the virus and increasing the oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification must be done in order to apply that method to the use of a large scale prior to the development of specific therapy.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effect, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate immune responses in excess and cause cytokine discharge syndrome, which is a potentially life - threatening toxicity.
Antibody concentration in the blood is usually low and plasma is needed in large numbers to treat a patient with a critical disease.
The development and production of specific antibodies is fast enough to combat the global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have recovered and identify the genetic code that affects the effective antibody or makes effective antibody transplants against the essential proteins for the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tigkok for thousands of years.
However, most effects depend on combinations of components in the formula. This formula varies depending on diagnosis of disease based on TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify the component or the optimal combination.
Currently, because there is no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative therapy for patients with mild symptoms until they are or for those recovering from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are found to be suitable for the COVID-19 therapy.
The level of recovery in the COVID-19 patient therapy was observed in several Tungkok provinces that used TCM in 87% of its patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei province, which used CCM only in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had a mild recovery rate (13%).
However, this comparison is still very severe because many other factors, such as the number and severity of the patient, need to be addressed in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends involved a study comparing Western drug therapy (WM) only with combination therapy WM and TCM.
They found that the time needed to restore the body temperature, the loss of symptoms, and the lack of care was much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
What's more impressive is the level of symptoms (from mild to heavy) much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and lower mortality in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
Even so, the effectiveness and security of TCM is still waiting for a better-controlled test on a larger scale and at more research centres.
The other interesting thing is to design a working mechanism and clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most of the patients expected or confirmed COVID-19 feel very afraid of the very deadly disease and even death, and the people who are suffering from it also feel tired, lonely, and angry.
Furthermore, symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and severe side effects of therapy such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental pressure.
At the early stage of SARS, a group of psychiatric morbidity, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor glaucoma, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicides have been reported.
Explore the history of contact and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 plague, can make people more concerned and feel guilty about the effects of stroke, quarantine, and stigma on relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for patients with COVID-19, those expected, and those who contact them, and the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with routine development and accurate information about SARS-CoV-2 waves, and the therapy plan and the use of devices and professional electronic applications to avoid contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are very important to break the transmission chain of animal and human reserves infected with depleted membranes and often the ability to complete antiviral therapy in controlling the epidemic caused by the outbreak of the virus.
The plant has been designed to develop a protein-based S vaccine, which has long and effective levels of neutralising antibodies and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live vaccines have been evaluated on a test animal.
However, the in vivo efficacy of this vaccine candidate in the age and model of fatal challenges and protection against zoonotic virus infections still need to be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS had been lying 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, the sporadic case and the Mers cluster continue to take place in the Middle East and spread to other regions because there are still zoonotic sources in the endemic region.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using deactivation virus, DNA plasma, virus vector, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunists is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to overcome because of the long time to develop the vaccine (meaning 18 months) and the variation of the dynamite coV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 just began to show the clinical journey full of thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient is able to heal without delay.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the design of a disease forecast is very important for the health care body to prioritise its services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical study reported so far, the following factors may be affected or related to the forecasts of patients with COVID-19 (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor in the SARS forecast, which also occurs for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs mainly at 30-65 years of age with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age in a study with 8,866 cases as explained above.
Patients who need intensive care tend to have a comorbidity and complications and significantly older than patients who do not need intensive care (median 66 years compared to 51 years), which indicates age as a prognostic factor for the end of the COVID-19 patient.
The sex type: SARS-CoV-2 more infected men than women (0.31/100,000 than 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Comorbidity and complications: COPID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to have acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart attacks also cause major causes of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-COV-2 is also reported to be associated with colangiosis with ACE2-positive, which can cause heart failure in COPID-19 patients.
It has to be noted that age and underlying illness are highly damaged and can affect one another.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects inflammation or net injury and is caused as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
Correlation between the CRP level and the curse and the forecasts of the COVID-19 has also been suggested.
In addition, increases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during network damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional signs of heart and heart function.
Key clinical symptoms: Photos of chest and development of temporary clinical symptoms should be considered together with other things to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As explained above, steroids are highly used immunosuppressive therapies for infectious diseases to reduce the risk of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many people who survive this disease eventually suffer from atrial osteonecrosis with life-long disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and short-term exposure to COVID-19 patients.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 plague, many patients suffer extreme stress because they have to go through long and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological advice and long-term support should be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on the demographic study so far, COVID-19 seems to have an epidemiology that differs from SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replication in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms at the initial infection phase, similar to other coV causing strokes.
Therefore, at the early stage or incubation time, the infected patient can produce a large number of viruses during day-to-day activity, causing a major difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-COV transmissions were believed to occur when severe patients and most did not occur at the early stage.
Thus, the COVID-19 plague is much worse and difficult to control than the SARS plague.
Now, a great effort is being made in Tiongkok, which includes the quarantine of Wuhan and the surrounding cities and the quarantine of the entire population with the hope of breaking the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although this is a serious economic and other sector in the country, the number of new patients has dropped, indicating the epidemics.
The most optimistic estimate is that the plague will end in March and the recovery phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be much more expensive than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and said that SARS-COV-2 could infect two thirds of the global population.
Canada's research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-concasions and colonization of patients who had recovered and returned from the hospital 2 weeks before. This indicates that the virus identified back could be a recurrent episode, similar to influenza.
Even so, the signs of the promise take place in Tiongkok, if seen on the basis of the number of new cases, which shows that the strategy is now likely to work.
Again, Ebola is predicted to cause one million deaths, as well as half of them.
However, with quarantine and strict isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
Maybe, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a non-pathogen virus that can be side by side with humans.
Compared the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit by means of a stick or a sieve, and possibly also by contacting directly with substances contaminated by the virus.
This virus was also found at the feses so that the possibility of a new transmission, i.e. the feses-ne-mouth transmission, was triggered.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which include 17 patients with previous disease and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful preventive measures should be taken to protect humans, especially those who provide health care, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who happen to be in contact with patients or those who are infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (the 1860s) help control the virus preaching.
Sick masks ensure that the jaws of those who have the potential for infection are neither aired nor stuck on the surface of the material, where the jaws can be passed on to others.
However, only the N95 mask (number 1860s) that can protect against the inhalation of virion with a small size 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virion can completely internalize; SARS-COV-2 is similar to SARS-COV in terms of size, both of which are about 85 nm.
Because the particles can internalize even five sick masks that have been crushed into one, the health care provider directly contacting the patient has to wear N95 (the 1860s) and not the sick masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers need to wear a suit of fit isolation to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a surgeon infected SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore a mask N95; the virus may enter his body through the eyelids.
Therefore, the health care provider should also wear a face - to - face mask or glasses while working with the patient.
For the general public in affected areas or affected potentials, it is highly recommended that each person wash his hands with soap is infected more often than usual, try to stay at home with quarantine, and avoid contact with people who have infected potential.
The length of three feet is assured to keep the distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homologous to SARS-COV, as reported on January 7, 2020, it must be a major warning to Tionkok that has a strong memory of the SARS plague in 2003.
Even so, on January 19, 2020, the Director of Wuhan Disease Control calmed the population by saying that this new virus has a low quality of preaching and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and the prevention and control of this disease is not a problem.
This message greatly calmed the fear of society, especially when the whole country was preparing the Semi Festival, so that this critical time went by to cope with a small disease in Wuhan.
The control body in Tigkok should take note of this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is observed by the citizens and can change their attitude and decision; (2) more sensitive and responsive to non-clinical information than waiting for official reports from a doctor or authorized officer; (3) more limiting the potential of the epidemic at an early stage, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) more frequently releasing targeted and effective training to increase public awareness of the disease and to test and increase the public response system periodically.
The COVID-19 plague is caused by a new SARS-COV-2 virus that began to sink at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread throughout Tigkok and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of this survey.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-COV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 plague has an effect like the return of the SARS plague.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to deal with the epidemic and deal with the patient.
COVID-19 is more about the age of the young and more about men than women, and the rate of death is also higher than the age of the young.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
The COVID-19 patients transmitted the virus even when they were without symptoms, while the SARS patient usually transmitted the virus when they were severely ill, which made it a major problem in addressing the COVID-19 ministry compared to the SARS.
This explains some of the causes of SARS-CoV-2 spreading faster and broader than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA base to check SARS-COV-2 can produce negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, a patient who has recovered may be more positive for virus testing.
This finding has greatly increased the risk of viral transmission.
As soon as the COVID-19 research has progressed, some important problems still have to be solved, namely:
Where does SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although genetic homologies have been found to be 96% between SARS-COV-2 and two coVs-like SARS-COVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-COV-2 comes from the gateway.
What kind of animal is the middle species to implant the virus from the original, tell the glaucoma, to humans?
Without knowing the answer number 1 and 2, we can't break the transmission effectively and the plague can refuel at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemicals show that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract and cause further pathological changes?
Does this virus also relate to an ACE2-expressed cell in another organ?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic go on?
How did the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Will this pandemic be a worldwide pandemic, ending like SARS, or going back periodically like flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other questions are very important, but it may take time to find them.
Even so, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
Human crowned zoonotic virus origin
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven co-evolution of the coronary virus (CoV) and its membranes, including humans.
Before 2003, two human coVs (HCOVs) were known to cause mild diseases, such as seizures.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverse the situation and reveal how severe HCOV infections can be and can be at risk.
The Sars-CoV-2 project at Tionkok Centre in late 2019 has caused CoV to be reintroduced and surprised by high transmissions, but with a lower pathogenity than his brother, Sars-CoV.
HPOV infection is zoonoses, which is why the original zoonotic understanding of HCOV will benefit us.
Most of the HCOVs come from the glaucoma, and in this animal, the virus is not pathogenic.
Some of the HCVs have also been identified.
Animal identification has a direct involvement in the prevention of human disease.
A coV-ingenious interaction research on animals can also provide an important monitoring of coV pathogens in humans.
In this quest, we provide a general picture of the current knowledge of the seven HCOVs, focusing on the history of their implantation and its zoonotic origin and the transmission of its interspecies.
What's important is that we compare and interfere with the HCOV from the point of view of evolution and genomic recombination.
Epidemi disease CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, the successful genetic modification clauses and the involvement of the virus evolution in disease disorders are also included.
Coronavirus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of RNA viruses surrounded, positive, and unique.
This virus has the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilograms between the RNA virus called CoV, because its morphology is like a crown under a microscope electron.
Based on its structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that has a similar slope.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open-ended reading sequences (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are intertwined. Both are translated to polyproteins of the replication pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein has further processing to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining genome consists of an open-label (ORF) range for structural proteins, including tonol or spike (S), enclosing or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complete proteins specific to a given offspring are also assigned to a number of coV offspring.
Depending on the protein sequence, CoV is classified as four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four types, the beta-CoV has the highest number of HCV and is further divided into four sequences (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that vertebrates and ruminants are a source of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while the fungus is the main gamma-CoV and delta-CoV reservoir.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross the barrier of species and some CoV has become an important pathogen for humans.
So far, there are seven human coVs known.
Among the seven viruses, HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-COVs include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, acute respiratory coronary virus (SARS-COV), Central respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV), and SARS-COV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as diarrhoea and/or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and SARS-COV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory tract infections to be relatively more patients and have a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung.
The first line of HCV-229E, B814, is isolated from a single patient in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been collected through a thorough study of HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, both of which have caused a healing of their own symptoms.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCOV infection is not generally dangerous until the SARS plague occurs.
The SARS plague that occurred in 2003 was one of the most destructive plague in the history of the present, which infected more than 8,000 people with a severe death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East syndrome (MERS) caused a series of epidemics that spread to other parts of the world during the Arab Semester.
The new HCOV 2019 (2019-nCOV), later known as SARS-COV-2, is a causative agent of the coronary virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has taken more than 3.120 people and infected more than 91,000 people up to 3 March 2020.
The alarm has gone off and the world has to prepare for the coming SARS-COV-2 panmeal.
The seven HCOVs all have the zoonotic origins of vertebrates, rats, or pets.
A lot of evidence supports the evolution of all HCOVs from the vertebrae. In the vertebrae, CoV is well-adopted and nonpathogenic, but shows a great genetic suspicion.
The COVID-19 epidemic has created a huge medical, scientific, social, and moral challenge for Tingkok and the whole world.
The original HCOV zoonotic research provided a working class to understand natural history, the ability to move, and the limitation factor of movement among species.
This study can also guide or facilitate the search for animal sanctuary, intermediate, and amplification of SARS-CoV-2, which has an important involvement in the prevention of the coming time.
In this research, we gave a general picture of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCOV pathogens.
We specifically monitor and discuss the general subject that the HCOV virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reserve, but is pathogenic after transmission of interspecies to new waves.
We also noted the HCOV evolution train that increased transmission capacity is often accompanied by pathogenicity clearance.
The end of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first strain of HCV-229E, the first B814 strain of a single patient, various coVs have been isolated from infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In a few last generations, seven HCVs have been identified.
The short history of HCOV findings in the chronology sequence (Table 1) is an informative guide.
The first line of HCV-229E is isolated from the patient's respiratory tract that had an upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which is further adapted to be developed on the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCV-229E show a mucosal symptoms that include headache, rash, leukaemia, and convulsions, including fever and spleen seen in 10~20% of cases.
Next in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from the body culture and the serial pathways in the mucous membranes that were still strained.
The clinical description of HCV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCV-229E, which cannot be automatically distinguished from other respiratory tract infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 spread throughout the world and the most widely transmitted trend during the winter in the area is under way.
Usually, the time of incubation of these two viruses is less than a week and is followed by illness for about two weeks.
Based on a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCV-229E have a mild temperament.
Just a little patient with a weak body failure system that shows low respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, is a pandemic result of the first HCOV documented well in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-COV, which is the third HCOV found.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Tigkok.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 deaths reported in 774 cases, widespread in many countries and continents.
Leaving the superseller, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with incubation time 4 to 7 days and peak viral load seen on the 10th day of illness.
Patients first infected with SARS-COV have myalgia, headache, fever, leukaemia, and dizziness, followed by dyspnoea, spleen, and respiratory disturbances as a follow-up symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal heart function tests, and increases in kinase creatine are a laboratory defect that is experienced in SARS.
Alveolar infusions, epithelium proliferation, and macrophages increase also occur in patients with SARS.
Next, about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include gastrointestinal tract, heart, and kidney can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokines, which can die, especially in patients with weakness of their ability.
The virus was first isolated from the lung biopsy opened by a relative of zero patients traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, efforts have been made to study HCOV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from children aged 7 months from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus is initially very sensitive to young children, the elderly, and the disabled who suffer from respiratory problems.
Corrosion, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolytis are found in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation of the male child's nasal species aged 8 months suffering pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus has been identified in the Netherlands, it has been widely distributed throughout the world.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of the public respiratory disease and its peaks occur early in the summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to obstructive laryngitis, which is also referred to as crude.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had previously been treated with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCV-HKU1 is reported related to acute asthma exacerbations.
Similar to HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E, and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
These four HCV communities have all been adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into very pathogens, however, the extraordinary case is certainly due to unknown reasons, as in the case of the more virulent HPV-NL63 subtypes that have recently been reported cause of low respiratory tract infection in Tionkok.
In general, when the ability to move efficiently and maintain self-defence in humans, virulence and pathogenity of the HCOV is also diminished.
MERS-COV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old lung patient who experienced acute pneumonia and failed to have a kidney in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed laboratory cases come from the Middle East, the case of imports with one second of the preaching activity to close contact has been reported in various European and Turkish countries.
The second secondary wave took place in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS clinical manifestations are similar to SARS clinical manifestations, which were identified by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also experienced acute kidney failure, which so far only occurs on MERS among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients showed gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases have been reported with high case deaths, which are 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most feared viruses known by humans.
In the mid to the end of December 2019, a retrospectively related pneumonia patient cluster associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tigkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the underlying respiratory tract infection is ongoing and caused by SARS-COV-2 as a Global Health Treatment and called it COVID-19.
By 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with the death rate of 3.4%.
It has to be noted, the case death in Hubei, Tingkok, a total of 4.2%, while the case death outside Hubei is a total of 1.2%.
SARS-COV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV with the image of a female, sneezing, and breathing.
Diare was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory disorder syndrome.
Although SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are very similar because of high-grade nucleotide homologies, a total of 82%, both grouped into different phylogenetic trees.
Sars-CoV-2 pathogenisitis is clearly lower, but more than Sars-CoV and Mers-CoV.
The infected SARS-COV-2 subject without symptoms has been reported and may play a role in the rapid SARS-COV-2 preaching worldwide.
Compare and compare SARS-COV-2 with six other HCVs showing very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation and duration of HCV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-COV-2 follows the general train of six other HCOVs.
Second, the COVID-19 is located between SARS-CoV and four other HCV communities (such as HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, and HCV-NL63).
On one side, SARS-CoV-2 infection showed a more general picture of HCV infection, which includes non-specific symptoms mild or even without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small part of the COVID-19 case can look like SARS-COV infection even with a slightly lower race.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also showed interesting patterns, having a mix with the HCOV community or the SARS-CoV.
On one side, the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCV community.
On the other hand, there's no Sars-CoV-2 transmission capacity down after some human routes still need to be verified, like the Sars-CoV and MERS-CoV case.
Last, just like any other HCOV, SARS-COV-2 can be detected from the faeces sample.
"If the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is important, as in the case of the SARS-CoV transmission, at least in a particular situation, it still has to be explained by the next study."
What's also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonally like in the case of the HCOV community.
Anyway, the image of SARS-CoV-2, which includes transmission capacity, pathogenesis, and preaching in a number of human lines, will have a profound impact on the fate of the end of the COVID-19 plague.
Four HCOV communities that cause mild symptoms have all been adapted to humans.
From a different point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both HCOV and human beings may be a species of cross-section of the HCOV plague in the past.
The HCOV that causes severe disease to humans and to humans with severe HCOV disease has been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCOV should be replication in humans in an appropriate amount to allow adaptive mutation accumulation to be used against the factor of affluence.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 plague lasts and the more infected, the more likely this virus is to be fully humanized.
If the virus is properly adapted, the transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control steps.
For years, the four CoV communities have been leaving the human population and triggering violence on people with immunocompetition.
The virus does not need an animal reserve.
On the other hand, SARS-COV and MERS-COV that are highly pathogenic have not yet been adapted to humans and their transmissions in humans cannot be defended.
Both have to defend themselves and make a living in zoonotic reservoirs and look for opportunities to spread to a vulnerable human target, possibly through one or more intermediates and amplifications.
SARS-COV-2 has a picture similar to SARS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCOV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit like the HCOV community, at least now.
However, SARS-COV-2 is more pathogenic than the HCOV community and not a septogeneic SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It still has to be observed whether SARS-COV-2 will be fully adapted to humans and circulating in humans without the benefit of the reserve animals or between.
Before discussing the origin of HCOV animals, we need to consider the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary animals, nature, reservoirs, intermediates, and HCOV amplification.
Animals act as an evolutionary agent of HCOV if they have an abrasive ancestor close to and share high homologous levels of nucleotide.
The gene virus is usually properly accepted and nonpathogenic in these organs.
In the same way, the tankers carried HCOV on a regular basis and in the course of a long time.
In these two cases, the invertebrates are naturally infected and are the natural invertebrates for HCOV or the invertebrate virus.
On the other hand, if a new HCV enters the middle of the womb just before or about the time the virus enters humans, the virus has not yet been adapted to the womb and is often pathogenic.
This medium can function as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplification agent by allowing the virus to replication temporarily, then transmit it to humans to amplify the human infection scale.
HCOV may have a fluctuated infection if it can't maintain transmission in the middle of the air.
On the other hand, HCOV can also adapt to interdependence and even lead to long - term endearment.
In this regard, the average person becomes a natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data retrospectively reveal that the case of zero SARS has a history of contact with hunting animals.
A study of seroprevalence further indicates that the animal seller has a higher IgG prevalence of anti-SARS-COV compared to the general population.
The moonlights and dogs in the animal market are the first to be identified with viruses such as SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the stops in the market were killed.
In this respect, it is reported that the monthly ban of wild or farmed animals that are not exposed to the animal market is largely due to negative testing for SARS-CoV. This indicates that the ban may only act as an amplification of the mean, but not a natural resource for SARS-CoV.
It has to be noted, because 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be said that maybe many small mammal species also function as an amplification factor among SARS-CoV.
It all looks like it's the end of SARS-COV.
The research for natural animals for SARS-CoV further revealed a nearby coV hatch, called the Rhinolopus sarns-SKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the Tigkok horse hatch.
This valve provides a positive test for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and a sequence through SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This coV and the other coV cables share the homologous sequence of nucleotide 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study is the foundation for a new concept that the pelvis is good for a new human pathogen.
Some coVs like-SARS (SL-CoV) were also identified from the wire, but only one, given the name WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from a sample of the vertebral faeces is shown using ACE2 vertebrates, suspensions, and humans as a receptor to enter the cell.
What's interesting is that the SARS-convalesen patient serum can control the WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the most vulnerable ancestors close to SARS-CoV in the pelvis, with a 95 percent nucleotide homology.
Apart from the high homolog between these two viruses, it's generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct SARS-CoV virus and a non-reserver of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis group MERS-COV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-COV use the same yellow receptor, which is a peptide 4 (DPP4) peptide, as a way into the virus.
The RNA polymerase sequence depends on the Mers-CoV RNA in a phylogenetic way closer to it in the beta-CoV tube identified by Europe and Africa.
So far, no MERS-COV has been found alive in the wild.
MERS-COV and his close relatives CoV-HKU25 are only sharing 87% of the homologous sequence of nucleotide.
That's why it's probably not a MERS-CoV reservation.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arab ovaries produce seropositive results for specific controlled antibodies to MERS-CoV, similar to that of the Middle East in some African countries.
MERS-COV's life is identical to the virus found in humans isolated from an Arab nasal strain, which further indicates that the egg is a real resource for MERS-COV.
It is also important to note that massive virus discharges with symptoms that are usually mild toxins of a trial infected with MERS-CoV.
It has to be noted that infected ovaries require viruses not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of viral circulation from the pelvis.
Even so, the question is still not answered because many MRS cases confirmed do not have a history of contacts with ostrich prior to the trial, possibly due to human-human transmissions or the unknown transmission route involving unknown animal species that carries MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homologies with CoV ratG13 insulated from Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV case, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to establish incest.
In other words, the snake may not have a direct SARS-CoV-2 reserve, unless the coV was found almost identical in later days.
It's possible that the animals between SARS-CoV-2 are one of the wild mammals sold and killed in the Great Ocean Food Market. Many early cases of COVID-19 are related to this market, which indicates the possibility of transmission of animals to humans.
A few recent studies based on metagenomial sequences show that a small group of endangered mammals, known as manis javanica, may also carry an excruciating beta-coV with SARS-CoV-2.
This new coV gene divides 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the coV is as close to the RATG13 as 90% in the nucleotide sequence.
Both are placed into two sub-genital viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which is part of a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a total of 97.4% amino sequence.
The thing that fits, RBD SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 are even more different, even though homologous levels correspond to the entire genome.
A previous study on a disease-disease also reported the detection of contig virus from a lung sample, which was also found to be working with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopts a different method of resolution and is concerned manually to produce a partial gene sequence consisting of about 86.3% complete virus.
We can't afford the possibility of a collision as one of the animals in the Sars-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that supports SARS-COV-2 comes directly from the call because the difference between SARS-COV-2 and beta-COV relatives-SARS-COV-2 calls.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is closer than the distance between SARS-COV-2 and beta-COV relatives-SARS-COV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary trails in the ear, the crack, and the other breast must still be fixed.
Although the highest homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 intrusive, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest homology at the highest level of the entire genome.
It's too speculative if it says that the height of friction between RBD beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 breaks down and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the convergence evolution of its selection mediated.
Comparative hypothesis supports the recombination between beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 fractures and RATG13 in animal species three.
As an evolutionary factor, many recombinations occur between beta-coV.
Researchers still can't decide about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCV, the zoonotic origins of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63, and HCV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E may be derived from cov celevar, while HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 virus have been found in rodents.
It is reported that the ARCoV.2 (Appellation Ridge CoV) that was detected on the North American three-coloured gate shows a mortality close to HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E genetically worked with other covs, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae also expected to be among them.
To make it more clear, the current knowledge of the origin of HCOV animals is known in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the transmission of HCOV interspecies in history.
In about 1890, when HCOV-OC43 penetrated animal species to infect humans, it was recorded through respiratory infections.
The history of HCV-229E transmissions is not too clear.
Alpha-CoV wires that have been working with HCV-229E have been found.
Between the two, there's alpha-coV alpaca.
Some evidence supports the transmission of viruses directly from the vertebrates to humans.
First, humans, not the alpha, who may be in contact with the echoes in the ecological relay together.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with the alpha.
Second, the alpha-CoV channel that works with HCV-229E has a variety of types and nonpathogenics in the tunnel, while alpha-CoV alpha causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-coV alpha was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of an alpha-CoV relative to HCOV-229E from humans cannot be sided with.
In fact, cholera is a direct source of human pathogenic virus, which includes rabies, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
That's why, it's not too surprising that the wires may directly transmit HCOV-229E to humans.
In other cases, while alpha-CoV cleavage functions as a HCV-229E lung, alpha and arabic cleavage may function as an interface that transmits the virus to humans, just like the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-COV is a very good example of transmitting interspecies from the gateway to the Arab enamel and from the Arab enamel to the human.
The origin of the evolutionary MERS-CoV of the pelvis is known for the early identification of the virus and is also reinforced with the discovery after it.
Clearly, the pelvis is a lung of a rich virus species for the exchange of the genetic fragments of antarspecies and the transmission of antarspecies.
A long age, a well-suited colony, a strong social interaction, and a strong flying ability, all are the conditions that support the deaf to be the ideal 'virus preacher'.
On the other hand, MERS-Cov has been in Arab caves for decades.
This virus has been adapted to the ostrich that has changed from the middle of it to the stable and natural reserve.
MERS-COV causes a very light disease and protects relatively low mutations in this animal.
Its broadcasts to humans happen by chance and humans continue to be worthy of the end of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be disturbed.
It's not like an untapped role in Mers-CoV transmission, a broken role, if any, in a different SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In particular, beta-CoV is called highly pathogenic in fractures.
Calling may be the end of the beta-CoV relatives of the SARS-CoV-2, similar to a suspension in the SARS-CoV case.
In incoming studies, some possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 interspecies from animals to humans should be counted or side-by-side.
First of all, it could have been a reserve for the SARS-CoV-2 family virus that was almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans are able to share ecological reverbs with the deaf by means of a reverberating or amalgamation of steel.
Second, the breakup could be one of the intermediate amplifications for the new SARS-CoV-2 family virus.
People get the virus through the healing and consumption of fish meat.
Maybe, a lot of mammals, including pets, are running into SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies to pets and wild animals should be monitored.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that are closely connected to the earring or tossing.
The original search for SARS-COV-2 animals is still ongoing.
Apart from various species of animals, three major factors of the virus side are also important to ease the coV through the prevention of species.
First, the relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to another single- lucky RNA virus, the CoV mutation's estimate can be considered "current" to "high" with an average replacement of ~10-4 per year per hit, depending on the CoV adaptation phase to new charges.
CoV has exoribonuclease anorexia, elimination that causes very high metabolism, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress coV replication through this exoribinuclease inhibition and RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-COV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Even so, the CoV mutations are about a million times higher than the windshields.
In addition, the changeover is often high when CoV hasn't been adapted to benign.
Compared to the SARS-CoV that has a high mutation slide, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation slide is actually lower, indicating a higher adaptation rate than humans.
Possibly, SARS-COV-2 has been adapted to other sources that work closely with humans.
Except for SARS-COV-2, this also happens on MERS-COV that's been adapted to Arab aunts.
Theoretically, there is little chance that genetic suppression will quickly make the vaccine and antivirus agent against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA gene in the CoV provides additional flexibility in the gene modification, for mutation and recombination, so as to increase the probability of co-evolution of the interspecies, which is beneficial for the emergence of a new coV when appropriate.
This is supported by many open-ended reading sequences and protein functions that are at the end of the 3′ genome.
Third, CoV is often turned over randomly during RNA replication through the unique "choice-salin" mechanism.
In a coal that functions as a compound, a change in frequency occurs during the transcription of RNA CoV.
A complete and very homologous subgenomic RNA can be recombined to form a new coV.
The phylogenetics of natural recombination have been found on HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as on animals such as SL-COV and CoV-HKU9.
Virus-inflammation related to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the virus interaction with the inhaler is another major factor that affects interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-COV is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection evidence during interspecies transmissions.
Based on comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolates and cessers, SARS-CoV is expected to undergo rapid adaptation in a variety of glands, especially with mutations on RBD proteins S.
In general, RBD protein S CoV interacts with the cell receptor and intensively becomes the target target of the bile antibody.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is amino acid to 318 to 510 on the S1 fraction, which is associated with human ACE2 and its correspondent as the path to the virus.
RBD SARS-COV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including vertebrates, musculoskeletal, rat, and rat dogs, to allow transmission of interspecies virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues observed differ between human virus isolates and suspensions in RBD and 4 of them are located in the receptor binding motifs for interaction with ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV must have K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of tonoline protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important for adapting the virus to humans.
It must be noted that SARS-COV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-COV.
The 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in the S1 protein S unit implies the affinity of the S protein binding with ACE2 human potential has changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed human ACE2 binding affinity and S SARS-CoV-2 protein up to 20 times higher than human ACE2 affinity and S SARS-CoV protein.
What's also important to know is if there's another corridor that might be needed for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCOV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E and 9-O-terracetylase asthma for HCV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the achievement of this COV adaptation in humans after transmission of the interspecies of their animals.
In addition to cell receptors, the end-of-transmission of HCOV interspecies is also arranged by other interspecies factors and limitations.
The difference between humans and natural reservoirs, such as the ant, the Arab ostrich, and the ruminant animals, can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCOV must take over the factor of the ingestion and mix the ingestion factor in order to succeed in the interspecies transmission.
In this case, the molecular sensor in the field of the interaction of these important viruses still needs to be identified and detected.
The entire genome implantation is unusual to see the interference factor and the SARS-CoV-2 membrane limitation using the highest CRISPR technology may be useful.
The new HCOV is coming back to the beginning of the plague.
CoV's belief in the stars gives us a great chance to see a new HCV.
In this case, the cov pelvis functions as the HcoV gene lung.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also stimulate HCOV evolution and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, a prophylaxis or loss of a gene implanting new protein potentiates the medification of the virus phenotypes dramatically.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is expected to play an important role in human adaptation due to the strained SARS-CoV strain virus found in isolation, depending on the variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-COV with a special feature of the elimination of 29 nucleotides was found on the isolated alien at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive mutation that supports a slight change.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV derivatives, with a large number of smaller recombination areas identified in RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, the recombination of the various breeds is reflected in the Mers-CoV epidemic, which took place in the Arab monasteries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination has also been observed at other HCV sites where HCOV has been recombined with other coV animals in its non-structural gene.
It should also be noted that making selections can play a role in changes that are not experienced by the viral genome, which is likely to be caused by virus release from the current selection pressure, such as the immune system.
This effect is a complete loss of ORF4 on the strain prototype HPOV-229E due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
While full ORF4 can be observed on an HCOV-229E-worked vertebrae virus, alpha-CoV-alpaca shows a single nucleotide component that causes string movement.
Finally, the new HCOV evolution was also driven by selective pressure in its tank.
Symptoms light or undetected when coV is infected, which show each other adaptation between coV and coV.
It looks like acclimatized tunnels well with CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, failure to activate a proinflammatory response on the ear will result in an efficient reduction of coV pathology.
In addition, the activity of the natural killer cell on the ear was forced by the implementation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer receptor regulation and the level of molecular expression complex of lower class I histocompatibility.
In addition, the level of high-reactive oxygen (ROS) species from high-density metabolic activity can suppress coV replication and affect the replication by exoribonuclease so that it gives selective pressure for the manufacture of highly pathogenic viral strains when entering the new membrane.
A more pathogenic coV strain may also develop through recombination, resulting in new protein perversions or new protein fibers to adapt to ingenuity.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have emerged in the last two generations.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in the brain of the reservoir, such as ovaries and ovaries.
CoV replication strongly without triggering a strong immune response.
This is where there's a secret driver without symptoms and the cause of a serious human infection.
The major symptoms are mainly due to the activation of an increased immune response and the cytokine storm, with increased lung damage if the immune response gets stronger.
On the other hand, the immune response from the coV replication has been eliminated on the non-method driver.
The same strategy to resolve the immune response relationship may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong on the cloud.
Therefore, the type I interferon supply, at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection on humans, should be beneficial.
Also, the inflammasom NLRP3 activation in the flawed jaw.
For this reason, the inflammasom NLRP3 inhibition with MCC950 may be useful in the COVID-19 management.
The Sars-CoV-2 occurrence follows the general occurrence of Sars-CoV and Mers-CoV.
While beta-CoV neutrons that share 95% nucleotide homologies with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also coVs that share 96% nucleotide homologies with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the pests and other animals in the market were found to have a virus identical to SARS-CoV, no direct mean for SARS-CoV-2 was found.
Beta-CoV breaks that are very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that the breakup may be one of the inter- or beta-CoV breaks may contribute the gene fragment to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 was deliberately or unintentionally made by humans.
CoV's back to the center of attention because of the SARS-CoV-2 plague recently.
The coV study in vertebrates and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reserves for HCOV on human transmission.
A lot of evidence shows that SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and SARS-COV-2 come from the divide and are transmitted to humans through the intermediate waves.
Remember that SARS-COV infection comes from contact between humans and wetlands, maybe wetlands closing and killing all wetlands inside that effectively ends the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, the strains should be moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmissions, since there are found some strains of the beta-CoV strains that work closely with SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism are transmitted to humans through cracks and other mothers still have to be explained in research at the coming time.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been in Arab caves for a long time.
It functions as an important transport tool and as a primary source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local community.
Arabians spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
That's why we can't kill all the hostages to control MERS, as in the wild animal market in Tigkok to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the mers plague, a commensurate approach should be made to develop an effective mers-CoV vaccine and combined with other infectious control measures.
Before we succeed in eliminating this virus, new genotypes can develop and cause damage.
Various zoonotic coVs go into wild nature.
Especially, the coV is very diverse with the zoonotic potential.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic coV to evolve and experience recombination, resulting in a new coV that is easier to transmit and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in Tigkok has to be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With experienced SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and deployment plans have to be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet for centuries.
These viruses are in its natural reserve until there's a chance to preach.
Although the ossuary has many features that support the preaching of the virus, human opportunities to contact the ossuary and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to avoid wild animals.
The surveillance of advances in mammals needs to be done to better understand the coV ecology and its nature, which will prove beneficial in preventing the transmission of animals-humans and the coming plague.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonoses virus is to keep humans away from the ecological relaying of the natural reserve of zoonotic viruses.
Some of the original zoonotic parts of SARS-CoV-2 have not been found.
First, if a flood transmits an ex-SARS-CoV-2 virus to a breach, the condition when a breach and a breach part of the ecological relay is important to know.
Second, if the glaucoma has a more direct role in transmission to humans, the human contact with the glaucoma must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammary that acts as an interface, the way the mammary interacts with other species, which includes humans, hearings, and throats must be clarified.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets who may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, have a good test infection and surveillance to do.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I'm calling, or I don't know, I'm hoping that SARS-CoV-2, or her native virus that's almost identical can be identified in its natural origin at the time of arrival.
The research of evolution in this field will evaluate the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Update diagnostic criteria "expected" and "confirmed" COVID-19 need to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance for the diagnosis and management of new coronary virus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV).
However, coronary virus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are increasing on the basis of ongoing research findings and practical clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies continue to be updated.
In this letter, we responded to one of the comments in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "provided case" and "confirmed case" based on the Diagnostic and Management Guidelines for COVID-19 ( seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the Tingkok People's Republic.
In December 2019, the new coronary virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused the disease, which is currently formally referred to as the coronary virus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is called acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guidance has been published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
That direction has attracted much attention since it was published.
However, it needs to be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and control strategies continue to be updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Management Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the Tingkok People's Republic (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, this commission has released a total of seven editions with a large number of contexts.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple score offer based on their clinical experience.
The results of their work added new evidence for our guidance and proved to be valuable references to this worldwide phenomenon.
We supported their significant work and expressed our appreciation for it.
Even so, the results of their work also need to be updated on the basis of the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Management Guidelines and the latest studies.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the expected case, a combination of one of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations is needed to make a meaningful analysis, or to remove three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and its surroundings, or another community in the case of the COVID-19 has been reported within the last 14 days prior to the trial; (2) a history of contact with the case in which the SARS-CoV-2 (by positive nuclear asthma test); (3) a history of contact with a patient suffering from dementia or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and its surrounding region; or another community in the case of the COVID-19 has been reported within the last 14 days prior to the trial; (4) a history of contact with the confirmed cluster of the case (≥ 2 cases in the case of the woman and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in a small area, such as home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestation: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) COPID-19 fibrillation score; (3) total white blood cell count shows normal lymphocyte count, down, or decreases at the early stage.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on the expected case with one of the pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) the real-time PCR positive test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full sequence by virus shows high homogenity for the new known coronavirus; (3) the positive for the specific IgM antibody and the IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 in the serum test; or the modification of the specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibody from the negative becomes positive, or the titer increases ≥4 at the recovery phase at the level of the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleate in the breath or bloodstream sample is added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples was added in the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth (February 8, 2020); then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on research into the evolution of researchers to find the optimal nitrogen detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood collection, which increases the availability of various specs, and supports the activation of certain positive antibody results into the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more evidence that reminds us of a patient with atypical symptoms and without symptoms.
That's why Zhou et al's blood vessels have to be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be checked in practice and in clinical studies at an early stage.
As a cover, we look forward to more direct evidence to appear and ask readers to comment.
For diagnosis of "expected" and "confirmed" cases, we recommend that we follow and follow the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team would also occasionally update our guidance as a relief.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily death rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 that day.
It's the highest death rate in one day because of that virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported a number of infectious cases involving 114 active cases and 33 healthy patients living at home.
A total of 17 deaths.
In a news call, director IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said death involves four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic.

On Saturday, in a video announcement, the Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, Obidul Quadrer said that public transport would be stopped longer than redesigned until Saturday came.
This public transportation stop began on March 26, and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transporting timber supplies -- medicine, fuel, and food -- is still permitted.
The first COVID-19 infection incident recorded in Bangladesh was on March 8th, on two new arrivals from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three men recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronal SARS-CoV-2 infections exceeds one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by a coronary virus.
The summit took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronary virus infection and Zambia suffered its first related coronary virus death.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free of coronary virus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,056,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases within 30 hours of 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, there are more than 244 thousand corona virus cases, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Office reports that Johns Hopkins University reported more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. were caused by coronary virus infections.
Throughout the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow’s mayor, extended the region’s quarantine until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians would remain paid without having to go to work by April 30th.

Stores in Australia lower the purchase limit of toilet fabric per transaction
On Sundays and Saturdays afternoons, Australia Woolworth and College's network each lower the purchase limit of toilet fabric to two and one p.m. per transaction in all stores at national level.
ALDI also applied the limit of one set, on Monday.
It is announced as a message on the cover and on the Facebook page of the network.
Drivers are reported to be preparing for the fear of COVID-19 when the population has to do an insulated asylum.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet fabric for shipments to the house to one parcel per consignment.
This change followed four orders for transactions previously implemented by Woolworths and Colleges each on March 4 and 5.
In his media statement on March 8th, Coles reported that with the ban on the four packages, "many stores still run out in an hour since the shipment," and mentioned the request "never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unforeseen".
The sales of "stamp up" last week, according to one of the teachers who spoke Woolworths.
Costco shop in Canberra also limited the number allowed to two packs a week ago.
To avoid arrival, Colleges ordered a bigger package than the buyer and increased shipping frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made preparations for special hair promotion activities earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Peritel Association, said that the peritel was trying to increase the supply, but the local government's limitations for the time of the truck shipment made it difficult.
He's expecting to pay the production costs, while the waiter's trying to meet the demands, and less special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that since the preparation had been made earlier, some shops could not organize special Wednesdays.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retel expert at Queensland University of Technology, said the store fills the supplies every night.
He stressed that toilet fabric is a large amount of stuff that is so low and, if it's sold, makes a lot of empty space in the racks so that things are getting more and more exciting.
Coles and Woolworths think [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet fabric and navigation can [buy] and there's a large number, panic may be minimized, the noise of Russell Zimmerman through the ABC News Office.
Who Gives a Crap's fabric producer said last Wednesday that they're out of preparation.
Kimberly-Clark, who made the Kleinex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, forced them to work 24/7 to keep the market, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real state site, reports that some property vendors offer free toilet fabric to the first bet shop in Melbourne, when less bets are held because the buyer takes the gear to get rid of the rest of the week.
The edition of the NT News Thursday, a day printed in Darwin, illustrated eight pages of pages that were meant to be cut and used as toilet cloth.
Shops are completely refusing to apply the limit, according to the ABC Australia report on March 3, they say they do not plan to apply the purchase limit.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, pens, dry food, soap, and soap.
Similarly, in Australia, on Sunday afternoon the British Okado supermarket was observed limiting the purchase of Andres’s toilet fabric to two decks with 12 pcs.
World Health Organization (WHO) said COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the COVID-19 plague is happening—the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only refers to the extent to which the disease has spread, not to how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to motivate the government to act:
All nations could still change their way of life.
If a country detects, tests, manages, isolates, and mobilizes its people in response, the ear of Theodores Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the WHO.
We are very well aware of the level of preaching and preaching activity that concerns us and the level of lawlessness that concerns us.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Disease, why this "has never happened before."
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "except influenza, there is no respiratory tract virus that has ever been traced from its appearance to global preaching that is moving forward."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic that was inflicted by a coronavirus."
He goes on, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
A new pandemi status followed WHO's decision in January, which called this plague an inundation of social ills that exacerbates the world.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this plague, "in her, this plague will make it worse."
Until Thursday, the Associated Press reports at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
Pandemium coronavirus 2019-2020 is a pandemium of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) which is ongoing and is caused by coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The Waba was identified at Wuhan, Tigkok, in December 2019, as a World Health Agreement on January 30, 2020, and as a pantheon on March 11th, 2020.
By 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people were healed.
The number of fatalities is estimated to be 4% in Tiongkok, while the world's empire starts from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
It's common to have a demon, a stone, and a breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time has passed since the Memorial, generally about five days, but it is possible for the emperor to start from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral therapy.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Preventive action recommended involves washing hands, closing your mouth when it is rough, keeping the distance from others, and monitoring and standing in isolation for those expected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded to restrictions on travel, quarantine, nighttime, workplace risk management, and the closure of facilities.
This pandemic has led to a serious global economic downturn, a reduction in the number of cultural, political, religious, social, and economic pressures, and a widespread supply of goods distributed by panic shopping.
Schools and universities have been closed at both national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the student population worldwide.
The misinformation about this virus has spread deep and there is an incident of xenophobia and discrimination against the Tinghoa people, people with East and Southeast Asian descent and appearances, and people from areas with a significant virus case.
As a result of travel bans and heavy industrial closures, air pollution, and carbon emissions down.
Health authorities in Wuhan, Tiongkok (the Hubei Province) reported that the pneumonia cluster was not known because it was not known on December 31, 2019, and research was carried out in early January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the Great Ocean Food Market and therefore the virus is expected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes the plague is called SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has just been found and worked with the coronavirus convulsions, the coronavirus calls, and the SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to fall ill on December 1, 2019, and the person has no clear connection with the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Between the early cases cluster reported in December 2019, two-thirds of the market was found to have a link with that market.
On 13 March 2020, a report that has not yet been verified from South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be passed on to November 17, 2019, at a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was probably the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case reported down in Tiongkok, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside Tiongkok has exceeded the number of new cases in Tiongkok for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with mild symptoms.
By February 26, a relatively small number of cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds below, were 2.4% worldwide.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested with COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
By 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policy not to test people with mild symptoms such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in Tiongkok, until January 23, 86% of the COVID-19 infection was not detected, and that this undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% of the documented case.
A statistical analysis published on March 30, estimated that the number of infections in Italy was estimated to be greater than that reported.
The initial estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concludes that the figure is likely 5.7.
Most of the COVID-19 sufferers recovered.
For those who have not been healed, the time between 6 and 41 days from the onset of symptoms to death is at least 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been associated with COVID-19.
In Tiongkok, by February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in elderly people over 60 years of age and 75% had a previous health disorder, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official deaths due to COVID-19 are generally reported to be fatal in which a positive test for COVID was performed in accordance with the official protocol.
The number of fatalities actually caused by COVID-19 may be much higher, given that the official number may not distinguish those who died without testing, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count with a factor of 4-5 fold.
A female juror for the U.S. Control Centre and Disease Prevention (CDC) admits, "We know [the number of deaths reported] is lower than the actual number," a statement reinforced by the non-intelligible report on the U.S. account too low. A calculation too low often occurs in the pandemic, such as in the 2009 swine flu epidemic H1N1. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside the South Bank occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14th.
By February 28, out of the South Tiongkok, more than a hundred deaths were recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and territorial regions have reported death, on every continent except Antarctica, and in general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
This number varies from region to region and from time to time, and is affected by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the time since the first plague, and the character of population such as age, type of crime, and health in general.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the cause of death to the global case is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) on 10 April 2020.
These numbers vary according to the region.
In Tiongkok, the rate of death toll fell from 17.3% (for people with symptoms 1-10 January 2020) was 0.7% (for people with symptoms after 1 February 2020).An additional estimate includes the number of fatalities in the case (CFR), reflecting the percentage of diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and the number of infectious fatalities (IFR), reflecting the percentage of infected (diagnosis and non-diagnosed) who died from certain diseases.
These statistics are timeless and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for a particular population.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimated the number of fatalities for pandemics as a whole between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The limit on this estimate is based on the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical survey that analyzes the impact of the assessment on the CFR.
WHO insists that this pandemic can be controlled.
The peaks and the end of the plague are unclear and may vary according to the location.
Macijej Boni from Penn State University says, "Without control, the plague is usually rising and then begins to fall when the disease is gone.
But it's almost impossible to make a reasonable project at the moment about when it's happening."
Senior medical advisor to the Tongkok Zhong Nanshan government believes that "this plague may end in June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17th, Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to leave, possibly for one or two years."
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical discharges and other steps will be required "until the vaccine is available (maybe 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's a small possibility that this coronavirus, because it's very easy to transmit, could disappear entirely" and this disease "may have turned into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Relapse virulence will depend on the group's inability and the level of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific and those infected can be without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are wheat (88%) and durum wheat (68%).
The lack of symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory spasms (flagma), loss of breath, breathing, nausea and muscle, headache, headache, dizziness, vomiting, haemopticism, diarrhoea, or psychosis. WHO says that about one in six people is severely ill and has difficulty breathing.
U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) reports an emergency symptoms involving respiratory difficulties, tight chest or chest stiffness, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and swelling in the face and lips; medical attention is advised immediately if these symptoms occur. Further development of disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, shock, and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with the results that confirm infection, the researchers suggest that those who are close to the confirmed infected should be carefully monitored and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
Tionghoa estimated that the asymptomatic ratio would range from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (when between infection and stroke) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, at least 5 days. For example, the estimated number of COVID-19 sufferers who lost their first 30%, then down to 15%.
Indication of how the disease spreads is still under investigation.
The COVID-19 preaching is confirmed mainly at close contact time and through small droplets produced when wet, sneezing, or talking; close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that uncovered stone could cause the droplets to move 4.5 feet (15 m) to 8.2. feet (27 m).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be triggered by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced when talking, and breathing drops can also be produced when breathing, including when talking, although this virus is generally not triggered by air.
The droplet can fall into the mouth or the nose of the person who's close to it or perhaps fall into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can turn respiratory secretions into aerosols and spread over the air.
Preaching can also happen when someone touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through pheasants, the risk is low.
The Tingkok government saw the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 orally.The virus lasts in the first three days after the Memorial, although the preaching may take place before signs of sight and at a later stage of illness.
People gave a positive test up to three days before symptoms were diagnosed, indicating transmissions may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Only a few laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases have been reported, but the asymptomatic findings have been identified by some countries when investigating the contact outcome.
The European Disease Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) says that although it is not clear how easily this disease spreads, one person in general infected two to three others, and this virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it has been found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and hard steel 304, one day on the cardus, and more than four hours on the copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and the temperature, and animals and other animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can reproduce the virus to humans, although the British authorities suggest that they wash hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that may have touched the infected person.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumonia-related patients associated with acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All types of SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to the coronal virus in the natural world. Outside of the human body, this virus can be destroyed if there is a built-in soap, which makes up its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely connected to the early SARS-CoV.
The virus is estimated to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that coronavirus is genetically classified by the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (the offspring of B) together with two pelvis strains.
This virus has a 96% equivalent to the entire gene level with other coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, researchers Tinghoa found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the sequence between the cholera virus and the human virus.
So far, the comparison of the whole through finding the most common is 92% of the genetic similarity between coronavirus called and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the call is part of the SARS-CoV-2.
Infections by viruses can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is finally done through the reverse polymerase transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to the infected secret or through CT transcription.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many features that are resistant to pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT must not be used for a setup or as the first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO published some RNA test protocols for SARS-COV-2, first released on January 17.
Test using real-time (rRT-PCR) polymerase transcriptase response.
Tests can be performed on a sample of breathing or of blood.
The results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is carried out on a nasopharyngos, but it can also be used by a number of laboratories and companies that are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, not one of these serological tests proved to be accurate enough to support its widespread use.
In the US, the serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by the laboratory certified.
The characteristics of the radiography and composite tomography (CT) feature on people who are symptomaticly covering the background glass opacity of the peripheral asymmetrics and no pleural effusion.
Italian Radiological Society is designing the international chain database to find inscriptions in a confirmed case.
Because it's stuck with other infections such as adenovirus, the unconfirmed PCR has limited specificity in the COVID-19 identification.
A major study in Tingkok compares breast CT results to PCR and shows that although there is less specific for infection, the rhinitis is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered as an infestation device in the epidemic area.
The neural convolution network based on artificial intelligence has been developed to detect the fibrillation features of the virus with radiography and CT.
A strategy to prevent this disease involves keeping a good person clean in a commensurate manner, washing his hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth before washing his hands, and wearing a cloth when it is sneezing or sneezing and throwing it directly into the trash.
People who may have been infected are recommended to wear a medical mask in public places.
It is recommended that the laws of the land and the laws of the land and the laws of the land and the laws of the land and the laws of the land and the laws of the land and the laws of the land should be observed.
However, the virus has reached its public level in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in society, and some members of society don't know where or how they're infected.
The use of location data by the government's phone for this purpose has caused a private problem, with statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for this kind of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or suggested for voluntary use, and on 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups work on a private friend solution, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of the user's cell phone.
Next, the user will receive a message if they're close to someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Only misunderstandings about how to prevent infection; for example, the treatment of noses and spasms with non-effective leprosy.
There's no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Cleansed hands are encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least two decades, especially after washing from the toilet or when their hands are dirty; before eating; and after washing their nose, ankle, or lips.
It's because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by a domestic soap that damaged its protective layer.
Furthermore, CDC recommends the use of hand-based alcohol screening with alcohol content of less than 60% based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of currents (in one minute of paparazzi infected for the hard core surface), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
The other route, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, is less effective.
CDC recommends that if there is expected or confirmed COPID case in public facilities such as office or child restraint, all areas such as office, bathroom, public area, electronic devices together such as tablet, touch screen, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machines used by the sufferer should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with chewing gum or using tissue when it is sneezing or sneezing, and then immediately remove the tissue.
The mask is recommended for people who may have been infected because using masks can limit the volume and the shortness of the explosive droplets spread while talking, squeezing, and squeezing.
WHO has issued instructions on the time and way to dress masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "the use of masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch the face with the hands that are not clean enough, which is a major source of recovery."The mask is also recommended to be used by those who care for others who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who suffer from COVID-19, although WHO also admits that using masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
A number of countries have begun to promote the use of masks for members of society.
In the US, CDC recommends the use of a non-medicine face mask made of cloth. Prescription specifically recommends the use of a medical mask is used for a healthy society, especially when approaching (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing masks when using public transportation or living in crowded areas.
Thailand’s health officials encouraged people to make linen masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited the public from going out in public without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear a mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government urged everyone who entered the castle to wear a face mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear facial masks when they were in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, has authorized train passengers and intercity buses to wear facial masks on April 1.
Panama requires the use of facial masks every time outside the home, and recommends making your face masks for those who can't buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social limitation (also called physical limitation) is an act of control of infections intended to slow down the preaching of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social separation methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
People can apply the social exclusion method by living at home, limiting their travels, avoiding many areas, using social networking, and caring for the physical welfare of others.
At present, many governments are obliged to or have social exclusions in the affected areas.
The maximum number of people gathered to be recommended by the U.S. government bodies and the health organization is rapidly reduced, beginning with 250 people (if no COVID-19 is known in one area), to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Lansia and people with basic medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and immune systems with a higher risk of serious disease and complications recommended by the CDC for as much as possible in the home in areas with disabilities at the level of society. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health professionals began to use the term "social networking" as "physical networking", to clarify that its purpose is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social relationships, either virtually or from far away.
The use of the term "social networking" has the effect that people should be completely isolated socially and does not encourage people to stay in touch with others by alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This recommendation includes an incentive to have sex only with people who live with you and do not have a virus or virus symptoms.
Dwelling in the house is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those expected to be infected.
Many governments are obliged or recommend quarantine to all populations living in the affected area.
The quarantine instructions are the strictest issued for people including high-risk groups.
People who may have been exposed to the COVID-19 suffering and those who have recently gone to the country or region with the wide-ranging COVID-19 preaching recommended to do quarantine for 14 days since the possibility of the last siege.
The strategy in plague control is rebellion, oppression, and slander.
Guides are carried out at the early stages of the plague and aim to track and isolate the infected and take other steps to control infection and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to stop the spread of the disease, try to continue to shift to the stage of mysticism: these steps are taken to slow down the spread of the disease and reduce its impact on the health and public health system.
The combination of adhesion and adhesion can be done at the same time.
The suppression needs more extreme steps to reverse the pancreas by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the control of manipulative diseases is an effort to lower the epidemic peaks, known as the spread of the epidemic curves.
This lowers the risk of obesity in health care and gives more time for the development of vaccines and medications.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to deal with the plague include the prevention of individuals, such as hand cleaning, wearing facial masks, and quarantine; steps at the level of society intended for physical cleansing, such as closing schools and canceling mass meetings; public involvement to stimulate reception and participation in such interventions; and steps at the level of the environment, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries also apply various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduces mass arrests and local quarantines, as well as a warning about the movements of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for the infected who carry out quarantine and wear large dentures for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan enhances the production of facial masks and penalises medical care. Simulation for England and the United States shows that mysticism (slow but does not stop the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (returning to the growth of the epidemic) has a major challenge.
The optimal mitigation policy can reduce the demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but still results in hundreds of thousands of deaths and poor health systems.
The suppression can be selected, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus continues to go into the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this first one is achieved), because if it is not, the recovery will quickly relaunch when the suppression steps are completed.
Long-term interventions to suppress pandemics have a social and economic impact.
There is no specific anti-virus drug approved for COVID-19, but to try to develop, which includes an existing drug test.
Taking flu medications that are sold free, drinking enough water, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the level of obesity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the patient’s condition.
Some of the diseases previously agreed for the treatment of other viruses are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also said that some "traditional and domestic services" could alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that increasing the capacity and adaptability of health services for the patient's need for COVID-19 is a basic step in the response of the plague.
ECDC and the European regional WHO office have issued guidelines for primary health care and health care to divert resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services for the COVID-19 test, if it allows to cancel the electrical procedures, separate and isolate positive COVID-19 patients, and improve intensive care capacity by personal training and increase the number of ventilators and sleeping places.
There are a number of theories about the origin of the first case (called a zero patient).
The first known case of a new coronary virus can be traced back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, Tigkok.
In one month, the number of coronary viruses in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Great Ocean Food Market, which also sell animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A pneumonia cluster with unknown causes was observed on December 26 and handled by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei's Hospital, which informed the CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Hospital told their friends about the "sars-like coronavirus".

The Wuhan City Health Commission then released an announcement to the public on December 31st and informed WHO.
A large number of pneumonia cases are not known to be reported to health authorities in Wuhan, who then initiated an investigation in early January. At the earliest stage, the number of cases increases twice every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of Tingkok, supported by migration during the New Year's Imlek and because Wuhan is the transport centre and main railway transport site.
On January 20, Tiongkok reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States has exceeded Tiongkok and Italy with the highest confirmed cases in the world. By 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have been healed.
About 200 countries and territorial areas have at least one case.

National responses include measures to banishment, such as quarantine (known as a domestic order, a local security order, or a local quarantine order) and nighttime. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were in a type of quarantine in the United States, more than 50 million people were quarantined in the Philippines, about 59 million were quarantined in the South African region, and 1.3 billion were quarantined in the Indian region.

WHO was told the same day.
When this announcement is made, the doctor at Wuhan was warned by the police because of the "dispatch" about the plague.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human exploitation.
At the end of January, the Tiongkok government launched a radical campaign later explained by the secretary-general of the Communist Party Tiongkok Xi Jinping as the "war of the people" to combat the virus.

A person who wants to go to Tigkok should submit a visa to the Tigkok embassy or consulate.
On March 30, the Tiongkok government moved business and factory to open up and provided a package of monetary stimulants for the company.

WHO commends the efforts of the Tiongkok government to control and combat the epidemic.
WHO observes the difference between the SARS plague 2002-2004 when Tiongkok's authorities are charged with covering up so as to halt efforts to prevent and curb current and crisis with the central government "gives routine upgrades to avoid panic on the New Year's holiday".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central government implementing the ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO Gauden Galea's prosecution said that although the measure "does not explicitly recommend WHO", but it is also "an important indication of the commitment to combat the epidemic at the site of the most concentrated plague" and he referred to it as "never happened before in the history of public health".On 30 January, after confirmation of human recuperation outside Tungkok and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the plague as the World Health Organization (PHIC), the sixth step since the first time it was taken as a result of the fall of 2009.
Director General WHO Theodores Adhanom says that PHIIC is stated because there is "a global risk of preaching, especially to low-performing and middle-aged countries that do not yet have a predictable health system.
In response to travel restrictions, Theodores said that "there is no reason to take steps that do not interfere with international travel and trade as necessary" and "WHO does not recommend trade restrictions and movements."
On February 5, the WHO welcomed the global community to provide a $675 million assessment contribution that would be used to build a strategy in low-level countries, mentioning the urgency to support countries that "does not have a system to detect people affected by the virus if the plague is severe."

In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health insurance program, warned that, "This is the time every government on this planet is facing reality: Awake!
This virus may come to your place and you should be ready, and insist that the right landing steps can help the world avoid "the worst."
Furthermore, Ryan said that the current data did not allow the public health office to declare a global pandemic, and said that such a declaration means "at the very core we accept that every human being on this planet will be exposed to the virus."
On March 11, WHO called the coronavirus plague a pandemic.
Director-General WHO says that WHO "is very concerned with the level of preaching and concerns, and the level of vulnerability to action that concerns it." WHO accepts a strong criticism because it is not properly assessed to deal with the pandemic, which includes a margin in declaring public health emergencies and classifying the virus as a pandemic.

The Tiongkok government received criticism from the United States, the British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and the son of President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, on the early pantomime control in the province of Hubei, Tiongkok.
A number of administrators of Tiongkok Province's Communist Party (CPC) have been stopped by a management effort to quarantine the Central Tiongkok region, which is a sign of dissatisfaction with the political bank's response to the disaster in the region.
Some commentators believe that this step is meant to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party Tiongkok Xi Jinping from the public anger of the coronavirus plague.
Several Tingkok officers, such as Zhao Lijian, refused prior recognition of the early coronavirus plague in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theory about COVID-19 came from the US or Italy.
The U.S. Governor Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as the "Tyongkok virus" or " Wuhan virus" and said that "Tyongkok's cover-up action gave power to the virus that is now becoming a global pandemic." This word was finally criticized by a number of critics as racist and "lost attention from his government's failure to deal with the corona virus."
The Daily Beast received a message from the U.S. government that analyzes the communication strategy and clearly comes from the National Security Council, with the strategy described as "All about Tiongkok.
We've been told to try and deliver this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television shows."Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claims that the efforts of Tiongkok to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of the propaganda drive to affect the world.
The head of the foreign policy of the European Union, Josep Borrell, warns that there are "geopolitical components, which cover the battle to get influence through the conversion of facts and "the policy of generosity."
Borrell also said that, "Aggressively knocks the message that, unlike the United States, they are a responsible and accountable partner."
Tikkok also urged the United States to remove the sanctions imposed by Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, as well as to send assistance to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation was 100,000 masks for Cuba blocked by US sanctions on April 3rd.
The United States authorities are also accused of depriving other countries of their own aid.
Other masks are related to masks reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey takes hundreds of fans for Spanish.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticised at least the European Union's solidarity with Italy that was affected by the coronary virus.
Maurizio Massari, the great Italian ambassador for the European Union, says that "Only a bit of a bit of a reaction.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On March 22nd, after receiving a telephone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Russian troops to send military medicine, special infection vehicles, and other medical devices to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted "high-level political summer" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid "was useless or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of committing a "geopolitical and diplomatic attack".
President Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mayo ignored the media report and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo ships with medical assistance to the United States.
The jury spoke of Kremlin Dmitry Peskov saying that "when offering help to friends in the United States, [Putin] assumes that if US equipment and medical supplies get a chance, they will also be able to repay if necessary."
NATO military training "Defender 2020" planned in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war training since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary General of the Campaign for the Suppression of Nuclear Weapons Kate Hudson criticises Defence 2020: "In the current public health crisis, this training not only endangers the lives of the US military and many European countries involved, but also the people of the country where they operate."The Iranian government is very heavily affected by this virus, with about two luxury members of parliament infected with fifteen political figures at this time or earlier.
On 14 March 2020, President of Iran Hassan Rouhani wrote to the world leaders to ask for help and said that his country had difficulty fighting the plague because it lacked access to the international market as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. This plague has prompted a call to the United States to adopt general social policies in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, family benefits, and higher levels of education for public health.
Political analysis suggests that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-electing in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea criticises "the ambitious and passive Japanese quarantine" after Japan announces that every person coming from South Korea will be placed in quarantine for two weeks at a government-designed location.
At first, South Korea's views are shared by the President Moon Jae-in's response to this crisis.
Many of the people of Korea have signed the petition, calling on the moon, on the basis of their claim of the government's failure to handle the matter, and praising it.
Some commentators say that it can enable governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, his parliament chose to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree without time, to suspend parliament and public elections, and to punish those deemed to be spreading false information about the virus and crisis management by the government.
Coronavirus plague is dependent on the lack of supply, which comes from increasing the use of equipment globally to fight the plague, the purchase of panic, and the disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Drug and Food Authority issued a warning about the lack of drugs and medical devices because it increased consumer demand and consumer interference.
Some areas also suffer from a panic that causes the need for trees, such as food, toilets, and bottled water, which causes a lack of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about the transmission of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director General Tetras Adhanom, requests for protective devices increased by 100 fold.
This request resulted in a price increase of up to twelve times the normal price and led to the release of medical supplies for four to six months.
This has also led to a worldwide lack of self-protection tools, and WHO warned that this would endanger health.
In Australia, Panama opened up a new market for daiguu to sell Australia’s products in Tigkok.
This activity results in the arrival of milk formulas on some supermarkets and is finally banned by the Australian government. After the prevalence of the COVID-19 case in northern Italy and Wuhan region, and the demand for food, the two areas are prevented from lack of food.
The steps taken by Tigkok and Italy in the fight against the cultivation and illegal trade of important products have succeeded so that the lack of acute food expected to occur in Europe and North America can be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its large number of livestock production, has not yet been filled, but prices can be increased according to industry.
Empty food was found only temporarily, even in Wuhan’s city, by the officers of the Tigkok government who removed the pig’s meat supply to ensure an adequate level of public hygiene.
Similar laws exist in Italy, which requires food producers to keep a reservation for emergencies like this.
Global economic downturn has been felt in Tiongkok: according to the media report on 16 March, the economy in Tiongkok has been hit in the first two months of 2020 by government steps to prevent the spread of viruses, and the sales of petals of 20.5%.
Because the South Bank is the centre of the economy and major manufacturing, the virus plague is considered to pose a major risk of destabilization against the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the market will continue to move until there is a clearer picture of the potential of the end result.
In January 2020, some analyses estimated that the impact of the economic downturn on global growth could exceed the SARS plague in 2002-2004.
An estimate from the University of Washington, St. Louis, says that the plague affects more than $300 billion in the world's supply chain, which can last for up to two years.
The country's Earth Oil Export Organization (OPEC) is reported to be "cooked" after the oil price has been severely depleted as a result of a reduction in Tiongkok's demand.

Tourism is one of the worst sectors of the world's narrowest travel bans, the closure of public places including tourist sites, and the governmental actions that restrict travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancel their flights because of the few requests, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British Flybe regional company collapsed.
The impact on the shipping industry is at a level that has never been seen before.
Some railway stations and railway stations were also closed.
The epidemic is close to Chunyun, the main trip season related to the New Year's holiday.
A number of events involving many people have been cancelled by the central and district governments, including the New Year's Imlek festival, and private companies have also been able to close shops and tourist sites, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many of the New Year’s events in Beijing and the tourist resort were closed to prevent mass meetings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and the traditional temple exhibition.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, cities, and Tigkok districts, the authorities extended the New Year’s holiday to February 10 and ordered most of the jobs not to be reopened until that date.
These areas are the producers of 80% of the country's PDB and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has increased disease management to the highest level and announced emergency situations, closed school to Maret, and canceled New Year's celebrations.
Visits to Europe and Latin America dropped by 40%.
North American and Central American hunters have 50-60% pollination.
This also led to a 33-43% census and a pedestrian trip to the shopping mall in March compared to February.
An operator throughout the world is dealing with additional steps, such as increased sanitation, the installation of terminal scanners to check the temperature of the buyers, and the maintenance of the event. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the resurgence caused by the pandemic could increase the number of people in extreme poverty in Latin America between 14 and 22 million people compared to the situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in Tiongkok lost their jobs.
In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus can cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the rate of unemployment can reach 32%. The quarantine area in India has caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages). The survey of Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian homes have suffered some job losses. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since they had quarantined in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, a total of 4 million French workers advocated temporary unemployment and 1 million British workers advocated a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany advocated short-term work schemes for their officials, called Kurzbek.
The short - term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Throughout the world, the art industry and cultural heritage are affected by the pandemic, which affects the operation of the organization and the individual, both employed and self-employed.
The arts and cultural organizations are trying to support their high mission (often publicly owned) to provide cultural heritage to the public, to safeguard the safety of workers and the public, and to support artists if possible.
In March 2020, the world and at varying levels, museums, libraries, venues, and other cultural institutions closed without time limits, with exhibitions, shows, and shows cancelled or suspended.
In response, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, resulting in the loss of the latest disease and the rapid development of it is the removal of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences, as well as brothels.
The Vatican announced that the celebration of the Holy City in Rome, which ended in the last week of the Christian Passover, was canceled.
Many groups encourage the Christian age to live at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services by radio, direct radio or television, while others offer drive-in or uplifting services.
With the closing of the church and the chapel of the Roman Catholic Church and cleared it of the St. Peter's Land of Christian ministers, other religious bodies also canceled the service and restriction of public meetings at the church, church, synagogue, temple, and temples.

It has caused the most significant disturbance to the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events have been cancelled or suspended, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-2020, the 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA, and the 2019-2020 NHL.
This plague disrupts the 2020 Summer Olympic Plan, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will "be scheduled again until 2020, but will not be more than the summer of 2021."All over the world, casinos and other games are closed and the poker tournament broadcasts are immediately suspended or cancelled.
This has caused many players to move to a grid, many gambling sites to report significant new entrants, and the entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups lagging behind or canceling a concert.
Many big theaters like Broadway also delay all the shows.
The artist explores a variety of ways to continue producing and sharing work through the internet as an alternative to the traditional direct display, such as a direct broadcast concert or making a "festival" web-based for artists to view, disseminate, and publish their work.
Many Internet sites feature coronaviruses spread in chains with many people who turn to humor and turn their attention in the middle of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 plague has been surmised, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against the Tinghoa and East Asians, as well as those from the affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
An incident of fear, suspicion, and hatred in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
The report of February (when the majority of cases are still limited in Tiongkok) records racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world that Tionghoa deserve to receive the virus or accept what they claim to be a similar reward.
Some countries in Africa have also experienced an increase in anti-Tigkok feelings.
Many Wuhan and Hubei people report discrimination because of their region.
There's support for Tinghoa people, both chains and lumbars, and for people in the affected areas of the virus.
Following the development of the plague to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to suffer from a serious COVID-19 plague, can also be a target of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from countries include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea at first sign a petition to ban Tionghoa from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan tag has become a train on Twitter.
Tinghoa and others in the United States and the United States reported an increase in the rate of racism and aggression.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for calling coronavirus "Tionkok Virus", the term that critics considered racist and anti-Tionkok.
The Ukrainian sensitivists attacked buses that took Ukrainians and foreigners who were evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from East India, bordering with Tigkok, and learning in large cities of India were reported to experience a related relief of the coronavirus plague.
The president of Bharatiya Janata's party, the state party of Dilip Ghosh, said that Tiongkok had destroyed nature and "that is why God avenged them."
The statement was then threatened by the Calcutta Consulate of Tigkok, calling it "kluru".In Tigkok, xenophobia and racism against non-Tigonghoa people are reportedly slandered because of the plague, with foreigners described as "foreign promises" and targeted for "refoulement".
Many newspapers that use paychecks have removed them for some or all of their coronavirus bites.
Many scientific experts have made available open access to the subject.
Some scientists choose to share the results quickly on a work server, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronary respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes a method that detects the presence of the virus and detects antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect RNA SARS-CoV-2 alone.
This test is used to confirm new infections or are still active.
Antibodies (serology) detection can be used to diagnose and monitor populations.
An antibody test shows the number of people who have been infected, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report, or those who have no symptoms.
The mortality rate of the exact disease and the level of inability of the population can be determined from this test.
Because of limited testing, by March 2020, there is no country with data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
By 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of tests that countries have made.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of fatalities reported, which are likely to be too high in some countries.
Using a real-time (rRT-PCR) polymerase response chain, this test can be performed on breathing samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngos or spray samples.
In general, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests carried out on choking strains can only be relied on in the first week of disease.
Later, the virus can disappear in the throat as long as it continues to replication in the lungs.
As an alternative, for those infected on the second week, sample materials can be taken from the breathstream by using a catheter or a material released through the fungus (sputum).
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time polymerase transcription response (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 testing tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
British Raya also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korea's Kogenebiotech developed SARS-CoV-2 authentication tools based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) that ranks on 28 January 2020.
This device searches for the "E" gene containing all the beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In Tiongkok, the BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency approval from the National Medical Products Administration Tungkok for PCR-CoV-2 authentication tools. In the United States, the Control and Disease Prevention Centre (CDC) has distributed the RT-PCR Real-Time Coronavirus's Real-Time Diagnostic Panel to the public health laboratory through the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the old version test apparatus provided results that were not convincing because of reactive errors, and the number of tests on the CDC in the limited Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being processed during February 2020.
Tests using two components are considered to be unrestricted until 28 February 2020, and only then the laboratory of the country and the local laboratory is permitted to perform the tests.
This test was agreed upon by the United States Medical and Food Supervisory Board on the basis of the Emergency Use Authority. The US commercial laboratory began to perform testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made a COVID-19 test available nationally on 9 March 2020.
No quantity limits are announced; the collection and processing of specifics should be done according to the CDC specification.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the Center of State Research of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Care Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop tests to detect COPID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for tests that can be performed within 3.5 hours with high volume so that one machine can perform approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation (U.S.) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA previously issued the same authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also accepted the US from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using isothermal nuclear amplification technology that is not PCR.
Since there is no need for a series of heat exchange cycles, this method can only produce positive results within five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes.
Now there are about 18,000 machines in the United States and Abbott expecting to increase production to 50,000 tests per day, tests using monoclonal antibodies specifically linked to the protein nucleocapside (protein N) of the new coronavirus being developed in Taiwan, hoping to produce results within 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid influenza test.
A library research published in March 2020 concluded that "toraks photos have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, including CT [computed tomography] findings, probably already existed prior to the symptoms review."
Special features of CT include multilateral background-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetry, and posterior distribution.
Subpleura dominance, pavvy madness, and consolidation are formed in the development of the disease.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the starting point of the pandemic currently shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many features of the circulatory system with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT must not be used for alignment or as the first line test in the COVID-19 diagnosis."In March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for initial alignment.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections on individuals since about 7 days after symptoms examination, to determine immunity to the disease, and in population surveillance. Checks can be done at the central laboratory (CLT) or with a point-of-care (PCT) test.
Automated system with high output in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this test, but its availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLTs, generally one peripheral blood specimen is used, although a series of specimens can be used to follow an immune response.
For PoCT, in general, one peripheral blood specimen is used that was obtained through a skin skeletal.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction steps are not required prior to testing. On 26 March 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provide notifications to the agency as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received Europe's approval for their test tools that detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in the blood sample.
Its test capacity up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR checks on the RNA virus.
In early April, Raya discovered that none of the antibodies that she bought were good enough to be used.
Hong Kong plans a scheme to allow the expected patient to stay at home, "the emergency ward will give the patient a special tube," they slammed into it, sent it back, and obtained the results of the tests a few days later. NHS England announced that NHS is pioneering the case test scheme expected at home to eliminate the risk of patients coming to the hospital or having to infect the ambulance if used.
At 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance German physicists said that Germany had about 12,000 daily tests in road maintenance and 10,700 tests had been carried out last week.
Costs are borne by health insurance if a medical test is requested.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, a series of tests were offered in several large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested until and including weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Hospital Technikion and Rambam developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining the samples and only further testing if the samples were found positive. In Wuhan, the laboratory of emergency screenings of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin language: ↔, or "Api Mata" in Indonesian) was opened on February 5, 2020 by the BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction being monitored by BGI Wang Jian and consuming time for 5 days, the model shows that the Hubei case can be 47% higher and the cost of quarantine management can be doubled if this test capacity is not available.
Wuhan's laboratory was immediately followed by the Hua-Yan laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities all over Tigkok.
On 4 March 2020, its total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day. The design multiplex of open source produced by Origami Assays can test as many as 1.222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. The design of this balance can be run in a small laboratory without the need to maintain robotic fluids.
Until March, the lack and lack of sufficient reagents have been the subject of massive testing in the European Union, the UK, and the United States.
As a result, a number of researchers have tried to explore the sampling protocol involving sampling at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA gene for further testing. On 31 March, the Arab American Union was reported to perform more coronavirus tests per capita of the population compared to any country, and is preparing to increase the testing scale to reach most populations.
This was achieved by a combination of up-to-date testing and the purchase of a mass-scale laboratory of the population of Group 42 and BGI (based on an emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" in Tiongkok).
Built in 14 days, this laboratory can do tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory that has this scale out of Tionkok.
A variety of test recipes designed to develop coronavirus genetic profiles were developed in Tiongkok, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts German prescriptions for the production of test tools sent to low-power countries without the capacity to develop themselves.
German prescriptions were published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centre was not available until January 28 so that the tests available in the United States were delayed. At the outset, Tigkok and U.S.A. had a problem with test tools; these two countries and Australia could not provide enough test tools to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that extensive testing in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of new coronary viruses.
The test capacity, most of it in the private sector lab, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16th, the World Health Organization called for an increase in the testing program as the best way to delay the development of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In March 2020, Tingkok reported on the accuracy of their testing tools.
In the United States, the test tools developed by the CDC have "deficit"; the government then removed the bureaucracy barrier that prevented the testing by the private sector. Spanish people bought test tools from the Shenzkok Shenzhen Bioeeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The company explains that false results may result from failure to collect samples or to use the test apparatus correctly.
The Spanish Mint said that they would attract the wrong product, and replace it with other test tools provided by Shenzhen Bioeacy.80% of the test tools bought by the Czech Republic from Tiongkok produced the wrong result. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test tools from Tiongkok that proved not to be accurate.
Prime Minister Matovic recommended that this test device be disposed of to the Danube River. Ateş Kara of Turkey's Environmental Health said that Turkey's test equipment from Tungkok has "high error rate" and they did not "use it". The English Raya purchased 3.5 million test tools from Tungkok, but in early April 2020, they announced that this test device could not be used.
Tests, followed by quarantines of people who tested positive and tracking people who contacted positive people SARS-CoV-2, resulted in a positive outcome.
Researchers working in the city of Vo Italia, the first location of deaths due to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests on the entire population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of those who tested positive have no symptoms, and all the cases found in the quarantine.
With the restriction of travel to this community, new infections are not at all available.
With aggressive contact tracking, travel clearance, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has developed far more slowly than other developed countries without extreme borders, such as the closure of the restaurant and the hotel company.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore recommended that people stay at home on March 28, but schools were reopened exactly after the holiday on March 23.
Some other countries also deal with pandemics by tracking aggressive contacts, border crossings, testing, and quarantine, but with non-aggressive quarantines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, have a much lower number of fatalities, perhaps because these countries are more able to detect people who have mild or without symptoms.
WHO recommended that countries with no testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send five positive samples first COVID-19 and ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO laboratories referred to for confirmation.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 are in North America, and 1 are in Australia.
In this case, the "positive test result" column was influenced by the country's policy of testing.
The country that tests only those who are hospitalized will have % of the positive results higher than the country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, as well as other factors.
Washing hands, which is also called hand-cleaning, is an act of cleaning someone's hands to remove dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Wash your hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" throughout the day prevent many diseases, such as diuretics and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or seizures, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, facial membranes).
Five times during the critical day that is very important to wash hands with soap is: before and after the big water discharge, after cleaning the child’s ass or changing the pouch, before washing the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or cooking meat, fish, or meat.
If there is no water or soap, hands can be cleaned with gray.
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after treating the sick.
After changing the pouch or cleaning the child that just used the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, ankles, or lipstick.
After touching animals, food, or animal waste.
Medical cleaning claims that the medical procedure is related to the practice of cleansing.
Washing hands before giving medical treatment or medication can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to clean hands of pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also important for the public.
Washing hands has a lot of health benefits, including minimizing influenza, coronary virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing digestive causes; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the mortality rate of babies at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that the practical increase in the number of female children is likely to increase slightly.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children due to respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple changes in behavior, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple act can reduce the mortality rate from the disease to nearly 50%.
An intervention that encourages the washing of hands can reduce the diuretic to about the same extent; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in a low-performing area.
48% of the case of diuretics can be associated with soap wash. Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diuretics and acute respiratory infections (ISPAs), as a subconscious behavior in homes, schools, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, a major ISPA, is the result of the number one death of a female child, resulting in an estimated 1.8 million deaths a year.
Diare and pneumonia cause death to nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before and after using the toilet as the usual means to save more lives in exchange for any vaccine or medical action, and to reduce death to nearly half and death from acute respiratory infections to a quarter.
Wash hands are usually combined with other sanitary activities as part of the water, sanitation, and cleaning program (WASH).
Wash your hands and protect yourself from impetigo caused by physical contact directly.
The small side effect of washing hands is hand washing that often causes skin damage as a result of skin dehydration.
A study conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that excessive washing of hands could lead to convulsive skin conditions, known as hand rash or hand dermatitis, which are particularly common among health officials.
Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCDs).
There are five critical times throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important for reducing faecal-oral discharges: before and after using the toilet (small water, large water), after cleaning the child's ass (painting), before washing the baby, before and before and/after preparing food or cooking meat, fish, or raw meat.
Another important time to apply the technique of washing hands properly is before and after treatment of the disease; after brushing, swallowing, or brushing the nose; after touching the dirt or handling the animal; and after touching the trash.
In many countries, the rate of washing hands with soap is still low.
A study on washing hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of the households used to wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate of 97 percent; almost in the middle of 77 percent; and Tickkok at the lowest level of 23 percent. Now there are some methods of changing behavior to improve the usual adoption of washing hands with soap at critical times. Washing group hands for students at the time determined is one option in developing countries to wash their hands in child behavior.
The Basic Health Care Programme, implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines, is an example of a step - by - step initiative to support the health and education of children.
Two times a year, the medicine is added by washing hands every day with soap and brushing teeth every day with fluoride, is the essence of this national program.
The program was also implemented in Indonesia.
The clearance of the micro-organism from the skin is reinforced by the addition of soap or detachment to water.
The main task of soap and detergents is to reduce the barrier to running and to increase the ability to drive.
Only water is an inefficient skin cleaning due to fat and protein, which is a component of organic dirt, is not easy in the water.
On the other hand, fat and protein are assisted by a sufficient flow of water.
Fat soap, since it can be re-used, may contain bacteria that have been found in previous use.
A small number of studies that examine bacteria removals from the densely contaminated soap conclude that removals cannot occur because bacteria are able to fertilize them.
Even so, the CDC continues to say, "The tea that is released from the fabric without touching the hands more like it."
Anti-baker soap is greatly encouraged to people who are conscious of their health.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or infections that are recommended is better for an antibiotic-resistant organism in the natural world.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which have a long list of strains of the organism.
So, even though the resistant strain is not targeted by the antibiotic soap, it may not be an effective one.
In addition to skin surfactants and skin protections, high formulations can contain asthma (ascetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactate) as pH adjustment, asthma benzoate as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioner (broad, vitamin, mantol, growth extract).A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Health at the University of Oregon shows that common soap is as effective as the antibacterial soap that contains tricloses in preventing disease and cleanses bacteria from the hand.
Hot water is comfortable to wash hands not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Hot water is more effective than cold water is in eliminating natural oil that holds dirt and bacteria.
However, with the confidence of many, scientific studies show that hot water use has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Manual or antiseptic surveillance is a waterless cleaning agent.
At the end of the 1990s and early 21st century, hand-cleaning agents began to be known as non-water-based alcoholics (also called alcohol-based hand-breathing, antiseptic hand-septics, or hand-septics).
Most of this cleaning agent is based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated along with the anticoagulant substances such as Carbomer (acrylate acetate polymer) into gel or with the humectan such as glycerin into liquid or fumes for easy use and to reduce the dampening effect of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide to the enzyme enhances antimicrobial activity further. Manual screening containing at least 60-95% alcohol is an effective male killer.
Alcohol management kills bacteria, bacteria resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis), and mosquitoes.
Alcohol monitoring containing 70% of alcohol killed 99.97% (log release 3.5, similar to 35 decibel release) of the bacteria in 30 seconds after dressing and 99.99% to 99.999% (log release 4 to 5) of the bacteria in the hands of 1 minute after dressing.
Manual alcohol monitoring almost completely ineffective against the norovirus type (or Norwalk), the most common cause for dilute gastroenteritis. Antiseptic handsets or alcohol wipers in the amount should be used to clean or close two hands completely.
The front and back two hands and on the back and on the back of all fingers are boiled for about 30 seconds to the liquid, boob, or dry gel.
The U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases suggests that the hands should be washed instead of rubbing hands, especially when the hands are dirty.
Increased use of research agents because of the ease of use and rapid killing of microorganisms; however, research agents should not be used as replacements of the right hand, except for soap and water.
The use of hand-based alcohol may often cause dry skin, unless the emolein and/or the skin is added to the formula.
The anti-inflammatory effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerol and/or other emollins to the formula.
In clinical trials, hand-based alcohol - containing emolysis has led to irritation and skin weakness far lower than soap and antimicrobial disorders.
Dermatitis allergic contact, urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or adjectives in the hands of alcohol rarely occurs.
Lower trends have caused contact dermatitis that interferes with the attractiveness of the product compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents don't wash their hands of organic substances, but only disinfect them.
Because of this, soap and water are not effective in preventing many pathogens.
The success of free-hand alcohol research depends heavily on its materials and formulations, and according to history, this product has significantly worsened than alcohol and alcohol abuse.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been proven to have continuous antimicrobial activity and cumulative after clothing, not like alcohol, which has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to a progressive side effect.
Many in the community have been unable to buy soap and use it as a substitute for wheat or land.
Abu or land may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is that if contaminated with micro-organisms, soil or gray may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, gray is also a disinfectant agent because, if contact with water, gray forms the alkaline pathways.
WHO recommends gray and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Technique washes the right hands based on the recommendation of the U.S. Disease Control Centre to prevent disease recovery include the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
Water flows are recommended for a baccoma that may be contaminated, while water temperature seems to have no effect.
Put your hand around it with a lot of soap, including the back of your hand, on your fingers, and under your feet.
Sabun lifts a mane from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than when using water alone.
Gosok for at least 20 seconds.
Squeaking creates shocks, which help remove the germ from the skin, and squeezing longer removes more germs.
The water flowes gently under the water.
Counting in the trunk can make your hands contaminated again.
Swim with a dry sheet or let the air cool.
It's a wet hand, and it's easier to recontaminate, and it's a lot more common than it's a hammock, a handkerchief, an area between your fingers, and under your feet.
The made-up and wrapped-up nails can store micro-organisms.
The lotion is often recommended to ensure that the hands do not drop; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
There are, for example, water flowing from a well or a bottle hanging over it and using it in a country where the water is limited (as in a school or in a rural area in a developing country).
Tippy is a simple technology that uses a bottle of water that is tied to a rope, a rope that is operated by the leg to pour a little water into the hand, and a piece of soap.
The effective hand offset is an important part of the hand cleaning process, but there is a debate about the form of the most effective hand relief in the public toilet.
More research shows that the paper sheet is much cleaner than the electric hand cleaner found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was carried out by the University of Westminster, London, and by the European paper sheet industry Tisseue Symposium, to compare the cleaning rate of paper sheet, hot air hand washing, and a more modern jet hand washing machine.
After washing and shaking hands with a warm air cooler, the total number of bacteria found increased by 194% in the fingers and 254% in the palms of the hands.
Moving with jet air cooler causes the total number of bacteria to increase by 42% in the fingers and 15% in the hands.
After washing and washing hands with paper sheet, the total number of bacteria decreases by 76% in the books and 77% in the hands. Scientists also do tests to determine the potential for cross-contamination on other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of cooling method.
The jet air cooler, which discharges air from the unit at a rate of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to spray micro-organisms from the hand and unit and potential to pollute other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 metres.
The use of hot air-hand cleaners spread micro-organisms to 0.25 meters from the burner.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product and Environment, various methods of hand-held evaluation were used.
After the release of the hand, the following number of bacteria is observed:
There are many hand washing machines, and the hand washing has been compared to using a paper sheet.
Washing your hands using the hand navigation board is an alternative during the journey if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand navigation must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Medical treatment was required long after Hungaria physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effect (in 1846) in preventing disease in the home.
There are electronic devices that provide a backseat to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the rate of infection fell with the use of the device.
Medical washers are made for a minimum of 15 seconds, using soap and water in large numbers or gels to soften and soften each part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed together with fingers tied together.
If there's dirt under the boot, the hair can be used to eliminate it.
Because I can survive in the water in my hands, my hands need to be washed thoroughly and my hands are washed clean.
After drying, the paper sheet is used to turn off the water (and open the exit door if necessary).
This action avoids hand recontamination from that surface.
The purpose of washing hands in health care settings is to remove the pathogen microorganism ("human") and avoid its predators.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that at least wash hands still at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patient so that they develop microorganisms.
One study showed that washing the right hands and other simple procedures could lower blood flow levels to 66 percent of the catheter.
WHO’s concept of cleaning hands can also be seen on its website for public comments.
A significant conclusion was reached by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can be measured and validated by hand cleaning if compliance with the rules is required.
World Health Organization has "Lima Time" to wash hands:
After exposure to the blood/drying of the body
before aseptic tasks, and
After patient treatment. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (such as "medicine" or "antimicrobial") works to kill the handwashing agents.
The kill function may be desired before doing the cure or in a situation where the antibiotic-resistant organism is very sensitive. To 'stoken' the hands before the surgery requires a liquid that can be detected and killed without touching, chlorhexidin or iodium wash, a sterile sheet to wash hands after washing, and a sterile touch to clean up and other sterile tools to clean the base of the nail.
All the jewels have to be released.
This procedure indicated the washing of hands and hands down to the jaws, usually 2-6 minutes.
It is no longer the time of the long siege (10 minutes).
When it is boiling, the water in the lower arm must be stopped so that it does not flow back into the hand.
Once the hands have been washed, the hands are rubbed with sterile clothes and the clothes are worn.
To reduce the amount of time you spend in the ministry, you would do well to wash your hands or use your hands before and after handling the sick.
To control the infection of staphylococcus in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit was cleaning the hands from the first 20% cleaning, and that the extra benefit was very little when the hand cleaning rate increased by 35%.
Washing with soap usually causes more than three times the incidence of infection to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. The comparison between shaking hands with alcohol-based treatment and washing hands with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds shows that alcohol-based hand-washing reduces the contamination of bacteria 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than hand-washing alcohol to reduce influenza A H1N1 and Clostridium spores difficult than hand. Intervention to increase hand-cleaning in health care settings can involve training for hand-washing staff, increase the availability of hand-washing alcohol, and written reminders and smoothing of staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions in various health care settings.
In developing countries, soap - washing hands are recognized as a basic cost - effective way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, at least some water supply, soap, or hand - washing facilities in the homes, schools, and workplaces have become a challenge to achieve universal - hand washing.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, hand washing in the vicinity of private toilets or general toilets is rarely available, although options are available to make the laundry cheap.
In any case, the lower level of washing of hands can also be caused by a habit that has been planted rather than by a lack of soap or water.
Dragging and washing hands with soap can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and bring about a change in the behavior of the long - term population.
To walk effectively, you need supervision and evaluation.
Systematic goal of 70 studies found that an effective community-based approach to increasing handwashing in LMIC, while the social inclusion campaign is less effective. One example of handwashing in school is "Three Stars Docking" by UNICEF that motivates schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other cleaning conditions.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one star to three stars in the end.
Building a toilet can be part of a hand-washing campaign to reduce the disease and death of children.
Day Cleansing the World Hand is another example of awareness-raising campaigns that try to achieve the goal of change in behavior. As a result of the coronary virus 2019-2020, UNICEF encourages the use of hand-washing enamel.
Some studies have examined the cost-effective cleaning of the whole hand in countries developing in relation to disability-adjusted life year ban (DALY) or the amount of years lost due to illness.
One study showed that the promotion of soap-washing is significantly lower than the cost of water intervention and other sanitation.
It's important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in a state of emergency, such as a newborn mother or a wounded soldier in a hospital, first known in the middle of the 19th century by two hands-cleaning stages: doctor Hungaria Ignaz Semmelweis who works in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "the head of modern care" in England.
At that time, many people still believe that infections are caused by the smells of a bad smell called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, the plague caused by food and infection related to health care made the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases more active as an important way to prevent infection.
In 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, increasing awareness in many countries will be important to wash hands with soap to protect themselves from the disease.
For example, the poster "the right hand washing" is hung next to the washbasin in the public toilet and in the office and airport toilet in Germany.
The expression "cleaning the hands of" means something that indicates a person's willingness to be responsible for something or to be involved in something.
That expression comes from the Bible passage in the book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to enlist Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare’s work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands constantly to clean up imaginary nodes; actions that showed her guilt for the crimes she committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been noted that after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate the tools they use to wash their hands.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after the meditation have a smaller possibility of being involved in the "cleaning" compensation action, like being a volunteer.
The religion orders the washing of hands for the purpose of cleansing and symbolism. The symbolic washing of hands, using water, but without soap to wash their hands, is a ritual part of the washing of hands in many religions, including the faith of Bahá'i, Hindus, the Jews, and the Lavabo in Christians, and Wudhu in Islam. The religion also commands the washing of hands to cleanse themselves, especially after certain acts.
The Hindus, Jews, and Muslims were obliged to wash their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam were required to wash their hands before and after eating.
Hazard control for COVID-19
Hazard control of the workplace for COVID-19 is a safety methodology and work health assessment for risk control using the prevention of coronary viruses 2019 (COVID-19).
Hazard management at the right place of work depends on jobs and jobs, based on the risk assessment of paternity sources, the level of disease degradation in society, and the risk factors for each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk employment has a minimum employment contact with the public and other work partners; for this work, it is promoted steps to prevent basic infections, which include washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and doing cleaning and routinely infected work environments.
The risk of paternity work is covering jobs that require close or frequent contact with people who are unknown or suspected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected with an influx in a society that is going on or on an international journey.
This group includes workers who have contacts with the general public, such as at school, the working environment with high population density, and high volume retelling.
Risk management for this group, besides basic infection prevention steps, includes ventilation using high-efficiency airflow, protection against radiation, and providing self-protection devices when meeting with COVID-19 suffering.
OSHA considers the body's health and body capacity to be visible to those who are known or expected to suffer from COVID-19 at high risk, which increases the risk of paranism very high if workers perform aerosol procedures on, or take or handle specifics of, those who are known or expected to suffer COVID-19.
Hazardous management for this worker includes technical control, such as a negative ventilation room, and self - protective tools that fit the job.
COVID-19 can have some effects on the workplace.
The worker may not come to work because of illness, the need to care for others, or the fear of the possibility of paralysis.
The trade mark may change, either in the form of goods which are requested or in the form of goods which may be obtained (such as shopping outside a busy hour, by shipping, or by raising).
Finally, shipments of goods from the most affected geographical area of COVID-19 can be disrupted. Susceptibility and plans to prevent infectious diseases can be used to guide protection actions.
The article takes into account the level of risks associated with various jobs and jobs, including the source of parentheses, the risk factors arising from home and society settings, and the risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The article also discusses the controls needed to deal with the risks and emergency situations that may arise as a result of the disaster.
Sickness and a plan to prevent disease may be in harmony with national or subnational recommendations.
The goal of the whale control includes reducing the gap between the staff, protecting people at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing bad effects on other entities in the market chain.
The level of disease in the business community is affected by the intervention taken.
Hazard control surgeons are a broad range of workplaces used in the safety and health of their work to group hazardous control based on their effectiveness.
When the COVID-19 hazard cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and the last self-protection tool.
Technical control involves insulating workers from the risks related to work without depending on the worker's behavior and can become the most expensive solution to the cost of implementation.
Administrative management is a change in the policy or procedure of the employee or the employer.
Self - protection tools (APDs) are considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but they can help prevent most of the partitions.
All types of APD should be selected based on the hazard to the worker, properly installed as appropriate (e.g. respiratory), consistently and correctly tested, treated, and periodically replaced, if necessary, and then cleaned, and stored correctly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low - risk employment has a minimum employment contact with the public and other workmates.
Steps of basic infection prevention recommended for all workplaces including frequent washing of hands, prompting workers to stay at home if sick, breathing ethics includes covering the back and the back, providing nets and trash, preparing work from a distance or working circles with time/time to step, if necessary, informing workers not to use the tools and equipment of others, and doing cleaning and disinfection of the working environment routinely.
The rapid identification and isolation of those who are able to train is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free of the disease, the signs of the disease, and the other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medications or other symptoms, and that the health care policy be flexible to allow workers to stay at home to care for sick family members, and that employees know this policy.
According to OSHA, paternal risk work is covering work that needs close or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 m) with people unknown or suspected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-COV-2 because of population deprivation around the business location, or because someone has just made an international trip to the location with extensive COVID-19 recovery.
This group includes employees who have contacts with the general public such as at school, the working environment with high population density, and high volume retrieval. Technical management for this group and high-risk groups include installing high-risk air performance filters, increasing ventilation levels, installing physical barriers such as leaking plastics, and installing a drive-thru or stand-up window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk groups provide incentives for sick workers to stay at home, changing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, making working with the time to arrive/to-live, stopping the physical barrier to the leaking plastics, stopping the non-essential journeys to the positioning place that is experiencing the turn-on range of COVID-19, developing a navigational communication plan to stay at home, turn-to-to-to-end traffic, turn-to-to-go traffic control, turn-to-go traffic, turn-to-to-to-to-go traffic, turn-to-to-to-go-to-to-to-to-go traffic, turn-to-to-to-go-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-do-do-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-do-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-s
The workers in this risk group rarely need breathing.
If a person falls ill on a plane, proper control to protect workers and other passengers includes separating the sick from the other with six feet long, pointing out a cabin to take care of the sick, and offering a mask of face to the sick or asking him to close his mouth and nose with a cloth when he or she sneezes.
You're gonna have to wear a medical handkerchief once when you're caring for sick passengers or touching the body or surface that's potentially contaminated and maybe another protective device if a sick passenger suffers from a fever, sneezing around, or breathing difficulties.
For commercial voyages, including cruise ships and other passengers, the control of the danger involves delaying the journey, isolation, and informing the medical centre of the ship immediately if a person suffers from a fever or other symptoms while on board the ship.
Ideally, medical treatment is done in the cabins of people who are isolated. After preaching to the public, for schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if the infected person has ever been in the school building.
If there is a public education at the minimum level until now, the social exclusion strategy can be implemented, which includes: cancel field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, voice classes, or food in the cafeteria, increase the distance between tables, time and time-consuming, limit non-essential visits, and use separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high level of education in local society, along with a social exclusion strategy, the length of school graduation can be considered. For law enforcement officials who do day-to-day activities, health risks are considered to be lower by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to make contact with the confirmed or expected COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same instructions as emergency medical techniques, including the use of appropriate self-protection devices.
If a close contact occurs during arrest, the worker must clean up and disinfect the pockets and tasks before being used again by using a spray or a cleaning sheet of stairs and following the standard operating procedure to control and remove the former APD and to control and clean clean clean clothes.
OSHA considers that the health and safety of certain bodies are at risk of being high or very high.
High-risk work includes health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation services that are exposed to patients known to or suspected to COVID-19.
This job becomes a very high risk of parity if the worker does the aerosol delivery procedure on, or takes or manages the specifics of, a patient known or expected to be COVID-19.
The aerosol production process involves intubation, induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and dental examinations, or the collection of invasive specimens.
The work of the living room involves high parity involving workers involved in preparing bodies of persons known or expected to be COVID-19 at the time of death; this work becomes very high parity if the workers perform an autopsy. Additional technical management for this risk group covers the isolation space for the patient known or expected COVID-19, including when the aerosol performance procedure is performed.
Special pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and in the body.
The specs should be handled with a level 3 biosecurity prevention action.
World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come to a different waiting room be separated if they are expected to be COVID-19.
In the United States, the N95 filter face closure respiratory approved by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of a written and comprehensible breathing protection program that covers the tests of conformity, training, and medical examination.
Another type of respiratory agent can provide greater protection and improve worker satisfaction. WHO does not recommend covering the whole or coverall because COVID-19 is respiratory disease and is not cured by body fluids.
WHO'S only recommending a drug mask for a screening officer at the point of entry.
For people who take breath specs, care, or drive a COVID-19 patient without aerosol delivery procedure, WHO recommends a drug mask, protective glasses, or facial scars, clothing, and handkerchiefs.
If the aerosol-derived procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by the N95 or the FFP2.
Remember that APD stores are not enough worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing APD needs through long-range medical services, physical scan windows, with only people involved in direct care can enter the room with COVID-19, use only APD needed for a particular task, continue using the same respiratory device without letting it down while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and ordinating the APD supply chain, and does not induce the use of masks for people without symptoms.

SUGGESTION: [Covid-19] Lighten the burden and prepare for the future
GEOMETRY: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No copyright protected
We realize that we are in a unique situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes the global human relationship and the responsibility we have for each other clear.
We've never faced a challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, work together, and the development of a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we have witnessed among all our workmates through e-mails, calls, and conversations is an extraordinary validation of humans, which we are fortunate enough to work with them.
Thank you and my unmistakable pride can refer to you as a workmate.
Last week, someone shared their appreciation for our work with me.
They remind me of what it means for this world to be able to access Wikipedia and how powerful it is for this important resource to remain available to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site continues to run, helps pay our friends, or helps to maintain our community's security.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, especially at the moment.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we'll make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenge and the best way to keep an organization alive during this time.
We are eager to remove the pressures and support our long - term mission.
If you need to reduce the schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contractors:
Our hope for the future is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set holidays, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world cannot be predicted right now, and whether you need to care for your loved one, shopping for the necessities of the tree, or going to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not watching your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should not have to be said, but we did.
Sickness or PTO is not necessary, enough to inform your manager and your team's assistants to review the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main areas of work can be resolved.
(If you are diagnosed positively suffering COVID-19, please inform Bryan in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the right attention from the manager).
The employees whose salary is based on hours will be paid full.
We have said it, and said it again, to respect our commitment to fellow contractors and hour-based staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their employment as a means to cope with the pressures of the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Some work is considered essential.
There's a few jobs to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, and the Data Protection Team, among other things, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start a process with all departments to evaluate the current purpose and shift our focus to support the essentials of our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most essential project.
It's getting late right now, it's gonna be okay for the future.
We don't plan on "daggering" after this pantomime has passed.
You won't be expected to work in the grass to meet a time that is not realistic right now.
We realize that situations change and will try to set a new target and timeline if necessary.
What about APP?
To adapt to the new reality and the expected working hours, we meant to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Agenda.
Our point is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to estimate that employees can prioritise important work, care, and care of loved ones while recognizing their needs or wanting to work with schedules less for a few weeks in the future.
The length of this time line greatly reduces the workload and the current planning pressure throughout the organization.
We'll present our proposals to the House next week and update the delegations and teams in the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you for the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, Mapping, and Office Cleanup
Last week, we were told that one of our SF-based partners might have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
But because we're very worried, we're working on antivirus treatment to infect all the surfaces in San Francisco's office.
They use antivirus fluids across the hospital to infect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floor.
Buildings use their own safe havens, using products that support the safety of the driver.
We are happy that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol to us and all staff members based on the DC.
Starting last week, our DC office moved to a long, long-term job setting, a statement with a direction shared with San Francisco.
As was known by some of our associates based at NYC, we were also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
The discussion is ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our partners worked far away for the first time.
Our longtime partners have long worked long enough to realize that it may need adjustment and they want to advise you:
The duration limit is at least one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into a few days.
To identify clearly, make a schedule, and send out previous publications.
Make videos as default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connections.
Guide the leaders to facilitate each relative, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and to record the list of speakers, and someone to help make a close note (or make collaborative notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy little food.
Join the #remotes channel in Slack to talk to your friends about your shared work
The SDM Operation Team is looking for a web-based ergonomic guide to support the expansion of the work distributed throughout Yayasan.
Last week, we've been asking all the beneficiaries to drive the community to cancel the public event on Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO says the pandemi is over.
We tell them that we understand our request for shelter and other limitations that could not have them completed the agreed activities and that no one will be given the gate because of the delay or modification of the target.
This week, we are going to go on with additional guidance on Wikimania and regional and other community conferences.
In general, feelings from the entire global community seem to be the result of this interference, but at the same time relieved of the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT is trying to prepare a website at Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT for special staff.
We'll use this time to share additional upgrades, answer your questions, and take time for each other.
We're in this situation together and we want to help as well as us.
Meanwhile, you can continue to get information from this email and all essential information related to the other COVID-19 in the Wiki Office.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We also try to maintain routine communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, shows, work schedules, or problems with hugging, or other matters that may require help, do not hesitate to inform and cooperate with the CRT.
We're here to help support and be connected to the needs.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Global SDM International Operations Director.
Do not overlook any of these changes as a result of our hard work and responsibilities.
Rather, it is a recognition that, at present, our work and responsibilities may need to be adjusted in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need, and provide the world with which they serve.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support one another and create a room for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps a few months ahead.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work as well as you need.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of Team Leadership (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is placed on the outer surface of the cell (cell membrane) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and usus.
ACE2 has activity that is resistant to angiotensin-II (ACE), with reduced angiotensin-II levels and increased Angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also functions as a point of entry into the cell for several coronary viruses.
ACE2 human version is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin 2 angiotensin 2 enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing a spleen placed on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has a domain M2 of terminal-N peptidease and a domain of nitrogen carrier amino renal terminal-C collectin.
ACE2 is the protein of a single type I passenger membrane, with an active enzyme domain on the surface of the cell in the lungs and other networks.
The ACE2 extractal domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as scheddase, and the protein produced is released into the bloodstream and eventually extracted into the urine.
ACE2 is in most organs: ACE2 is placed on the primary alveolar cell membranes of type II, low-use enterositis, endothel arterial cells and veins, and muscle polio of the arteries in most organs.
MRNA ACE2 is also found in brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stems.
The main function of ACE2 is the ACE balance sheet.
ACE divided angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cut the amino phenylalanine terminal carboxyl from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and its hemodrolisisis angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break up a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, appelin, neurotensin, dimorphine A, and grelin.
ACE2 also arranged a chain of nitrogen carrier membranes of neutral amino SLC6A19 and was involved in Hartnup’s disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 functions as the primary point of entry into the cell for several coronaviruses, which includes HCV-NL63; SARS-COV (virus causing SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of S1 protein to the spike or toxins SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endositosis and viral and enzyme translocation into the endocrine contained in the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires the priming protein S by TMPRSS2 protease, which is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This makes people hypotheses that the ACE2 level alignment in the cell may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend further ACE and standard ARB inhibitor therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis research, published on 11 July 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors causes a significant 34% adjustment in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Furthermore, "the use of an ACE inhibitor also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients at higher risk for pneumonia, especially stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of an ACE inhibitor is also associated with pneumonia-related mortality, although the result is less powerful than the risk of overall pneumonia."
ACE2 human recombinant (rhACE2) is expected to be new therapy for acute lung injury, and it appears to increase lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipolysaccharide.
RACE2 half-life for humans about 10 hours with 30 minutes of work breaks apart from 24 hours of effect.
Some findings indicate that rACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to the renin-angiotensin (RAS) inhibitor or disease with angiotensin II in increased blood circulation. RACE2 infusion has been evaluated in a clinical trial for acute respiratory syndrome.
b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software application designed to help track the contact to overcome the coronary virus pandemic 2019-2020, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contact") that may have made contact with infected people.
Many applications have been developed or developed, which have received official government support in several areas and jurisdictions.
Some workflows to build up contacts tracking applications have been developed.
The problem of privacy is questioned, especially related to systems based on the geographical location of the application user.
Alternatives that don't get too close to privacy cover the use of the Bluetooth signal to record the user's proximity to another phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In Tiongkok, the Tiongkok government, along with Alipay, has distributed applications that allow citizens to check if they have contacted the COVID-19 suffering.
This application is used in more than 200 Tigkok cities. In Singapore, the application name TraceTogether is used.
This application was developed by the local IT community, written as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launches "StopKorona!", an application based on Bluetooth to track the proportions of people with infectious potential and respond quickly to health care authorities.
This application is being developed by Communication and Technology and Health.
By 14 April 2020, the app is still waiting for Google Play Store and Apple App Store approval.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking application was in the process of further development and would be available for distribution within a few weeks. Similar applications were developed in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether Singapore application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia means introducing geofencing applications for the diagnosed patients living in Moscow; this application is designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur on application-based systems, which include false positives and the possibility of less effectiveness if the data collected is limited to only a small part of the population.
To overcome concerns about the preaching of the "coron virus" application that is misleading or dangerous, Apple sets limits on the type of organization that can add the related coron virus application to the App Store, which is limited only to the "resmi" organization or that has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply a similar approach.
Private supporters expressed their concern about the implications of massive surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued statements that limit such surveillance.
This organization has eight requirements on government projects:
surveillance must be "in accordance with law, necessity, and proportionality";
the need for monitoring and surveillance must have a solar claustro;
use of data must be limited for the purpose of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data shall be protected and proved on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalisation;
each division of data with a third party shall be defined by laws;
there shall be protection against abuse and the right of nationals to respond to abuse;
Participation means all my "relevant stakeholders", which includes public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issue a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple article means to deal with surveillance problems continually by removing the tracking mechanism from the device operating system after no longer required.
Some countries use network-based tracking, not application-based, so as to eliminate the need to download applications and capabilities to avoid detection.
In Israel, a network based survey was agreed upon.
A network-based solution that has access to home location data has a potential for significant privacy problems.
However, not all systems with a central server need access to personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and used by the central server only for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application system is used to monitor contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes tracking data from mobile devices and card transaction data, and connects this information to produce notifications through text messages to people with infected potential.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also makes the information available to the public, which is permitted by a wide-ranging change in the privacy of the information laws after Mers has burned it in that country.
This information is available to the general public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using a system that's broken down and a system that protects privacy.
By 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been detailed.
A privacy-protected contact is a concept that has already been mapled, with a large number of research literature beginning in 2013 at least. On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups work on a private friendship solution, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the proximity of the user with other phones.
However, the PEPP-PT is an attempt to coordinate which has a centralized and decentralized approach, not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol covers the Approaching Protection of the Decentralization Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously called the Contact Event Number, CEN), the Protocol and the Privacy Sensitivity Mechanism for the PACT, and so on.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified has never left the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Media Lab Private Group develops SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-protective techniques when collecting and using location or frequency intersection data to track the COVID-19 preaching.
This is based on a study of the white film "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" written in March 2020.The other similar work is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology and was originally built in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive health information and locations with other users and employees without sacrificing the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was set up by groups that have the same basic approach as many closed protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which are the main means of achieving a wide reception.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its government's official application as an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that manages Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced initiatives to track contacts, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and encryption technologies that protect privacy.
They also publish the intellectual technology specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to be launched in three stages:
tool launch to allow governments to make official applications to track coronavirus that protect privacy
the integration of this function directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple are planning to deal with data collection and surveillance problems, continuing with the initial allocation of the system through the upgrade of the operating system, then removing it in the same way after the threat has passed.
b'Repositories of drugs (also called a new purpose, new profile, or a new task on drugs or a change of therapy) are the use of drugs that have been agreed for new treatment, i.e. for diseases or medical conditions that are different for the early development of drugs.
This route is a scientific research course that is currently being carried out to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Another study included the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the plasma transfusion of convalescent. SARS-COV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has several binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites can be the basis of an effective antiviral development project for the COVID-19 protein.
Several SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are the most important proteases such as papain, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A, et al examined some of the candidates who were then optimized and analyzed adjudication with the agreed drug and had the highest skill to accelerate the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potent drugs in its preclinical study to be recommended in clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial medicine that is also used to treat a number of autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that related chloroquine and hydrochloroquine were two of the four drugs to be considered as part of the Solidaritas clinical trial.
The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the testing of chloroquine and hydrochloroquine in New York would begin on March 24th. On March 28, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate based on the U.S.
These treatments have not yet been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and diauthorisation based on the United States as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients treated with liver disease, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
CDC says that "use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been established.
The doctor said they used that drug when there was no other choice.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is doing a small study on the use of chloroquine combined with feces, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Large studies are being carried out at Duke University and University of Oxford.
The NYU Langone Medical School is testing the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine preventive use.
Tiongkok clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in the median of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the medicine.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients received favipiravir and half of them received omifenevir.
The Italian Pharmacy reminded the public that the evidence to support the drug was not much and too much today.
On April 2nd, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine from Japan for preparation and use the military to send the medicine to the university hospital, where it would be used to treat the COVID-19 patient.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has offered to the Trump government the purchase of the medicine, which may be less effective in the case of a serious virus that has been replicationd.
This medicine may not be safe if it is used by a pregnant mother or someone who is trying to get pregnant.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir antivirus and ritonavir, concluded that "there is no therapeutic benefit".
This drug is designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to medicate a drug to find a life that will be linked to SARS-CoV-2 protease.There are criticisms in the scientific community about resource allocations for medicinal products developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO incorporates lopinavir/ritonavir into the trial of International Solidarity.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a cure for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Then, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir has antivirus activity in vitro against some philo-, pneumo-, paramixo-, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance through mutations that can lead to worse diseases and transmissions.
Some early trials showed that remdesivir may have a high genetic potential for resistance. Some clinical trials are ongoing, including two clinical trials performed by Cleveland University Hospital Hospital, which is one for people with disease and one for those with severe disease.
There are three clinical trials going on for intravenous vitamin C for people treated with IVID-19 severe, i.e. two controlled placebos (Tigkok, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The New York State started testing for azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
Japanese National Health and Global Medicine Centre (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (cyclesonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of patients with new pre-immaturative coronary virus infection.
For an angiotensin-angiotensin-angiotensin-angiotensin-angiotensin-angiotensin-angiotensin-angiotensin-angiotensin-a-trial phase II tests are going on with 200 patients will be recruited from an acute case in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to find out the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently examining the role of colkisin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients who suffer mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require care.
Women who are pregnant or who are pregnant or who are not using an effective method of contraception do not meet the requirements.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Heparin is a low - molecular agent that is widely used to treat patients so as to encourage the Italian Medical Body to publish guidelines on its use.
A multifaceted study in 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium at prophylaxis and therapeutic doses was published in Italy on 14 April.
Because SARS-COV-2 is a virus, a lot of scientific attention has been focused on giving new treatment purposes to the approved antivirus drug and developed for previous diseases, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition Tigkok guide
Umifenevir: umifenevir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition Tigkok guide
Some antibiotics identified are potential drugs that can be given new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-receptor IL-6): Agreed by Tigkok.
In addition, the test is also done in Italy and Tigkok, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaccin COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine that has completed a clinical trial, there is much effort being made to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causeant virus will not be available within a period of less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in the Phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The great wave spreads worldwide in 2020, resulting in large investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the genome published to develop vaccines that may fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative made a statement in April that what should be observed in the development of vaccines is speed, production capacity, preaching on the scale needed, and global access.
In April, CEPI researchers reported that 10 different technology platforms are in research and development during early 2020 to make an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform target for Phase I security study, including:
nucleate asthma (DNA and RNA) (phase I development and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
vector virus (phase I and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as an active project (79, according to the Milk Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered to be planned or planned).
Phase I-II tests have been performed in the early safety and immunogenicity tests, usually done by random, placebo-controlled, and in some locations, determining a more accurate effective dose.
Phase III test usually involves more participants, including control groups, and tests the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects on optimal doses.
Of the 79 active candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 are not yet in human evaluation (still in the "praklinis" study).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, Queensland University announced that they were investigating the potential of a molecular sneezing vaccine that would genetically medify the virus protein to trigger an immune response.
On January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that they began developing the vaccine, with a target test on humans in 2021.

On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Medical Research Command and the U.S. Army Department at Fort Detrick and Walter Reed National Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in West Maryland, announced that they were developing vaccines.
On March 10, 2020, the Biosolutions Emergency announced that they were working with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of vaccines.
Furthermore, this conflict exacerbated the plan of the Hellenistic trial and Phase I clinical trial in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were operating 11 isolates, and even on the fast track, the development of vaccines at least takes about one and a half years to two years.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported a particle development similar to coronavirus with partial management from Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
This vaccine candidate is being studied in the laboratory, with a test on humans planned in July or August 2020.
At the beginning of that week, The Guardian reported that President Donald Trump has offered "'a large sum of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, who was defended by the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced an alliance with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop mRNA-based vaccines.
Currently, a candidate for a vaccine based on mRNA, BNT162, is in a preclinical test with a clinical trial expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that they would receive the results of a praklin test in April 2020 and the vaccine candidate in the final stage could begin to be tested on humans in autumn.
On 19 March 2020 in France, the Innovation Innovation Coalition Epidemi Epidemi (CEPI) announced a total investment of $4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wine, Austria), and Pittsburgh University, with a total ECI investment in the development of COVID-19 vaccines to the US$29 million.
Another ECI investment partner for the development of COVID-19 vaccines is Moderna, Curevac, Inovo, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford, and University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, the Russian Health Officer announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates in animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing RNA vaccines that can amplify themselves for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days after receiving a sequence from Tigkok.
At the end of March, the Government of Canada announced a total of C$275 million for 96 medical research projects on COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government has announced a total of C$192 million special funds to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccinal bank" with some new vaccines that can be used if another coronary disease occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh University Medical Faculty reported a trial of PittCoVacc, a COVID-19 candidate, on a mouse; they said that "MNA that gave the S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine resulted in a specific antigen response that was able to [in mice] that began to appear 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the design of a vaccine candidate based on DNA as a potential nasal spray.
By using bacteria, DNA is designed to replication into human bacteria to produce non-hazardous-like particles, which can induce the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM's supercomputers, combined with the resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
It means that these vaccines can benefit from outside the disease they are infected with.
Further tests in Australia try to follow 4,170 health - care professionals.
There is a chance that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, shows the need to take steps to achieve the level of biological safety 3 in the management of live virus, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animals.
By 2020, there has been no protection medicine or vaccine for SARS that has proved safe and effective for humans.
According to the research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of vaccines and new medicines to treat SARS is a priority for governments and health institutions around the world, and there is no proven vaccine for MERS.
When MERS is a prevalence, the established SARS research can be a useful platform for developing vaccines and therapy against MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (DNA base) that completed phase I clinical trials on humans, and three other vaccines are in process, all of which are virus vectors, two adenovirus vectors (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media reports suggest conspiracy theories that claim viruses behind the COVID-19 have been identified before and that the vaccine has been available.
Patents written by various social media posts refer to patents that exist for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus color, such as coronavirus SARS.
b'Penyat coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a malignant disease caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
It's common to have a demon, a stone, and a breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle nerves, diarrhoea, sore throats, loss of pen strength, and stomach pain.
The time has passed since the Memorial, generally about five days, but it is possible for the emperor to start from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases have been associated with mild symptoms, some have developed into virus pneumonia and have failed to control organs.
By 17 April 2020, over 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been healed, and this virus is mainly spreading interpersonality when close contact occurs, often through small cracks or droplets produced through the spine, kisses, or when talking.
Although it was produced when breathing, the droplets usually fell to the ground or to the surface and did not move to the distance.
People can also be infected by touching the contaminated surface and touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus is very active for the first three days after symptoms are resolved, although the preaching may occur before symptoms occur and after the next stage of the disease. Standard diagnostic method is with the response of the real-time polymerase transcription chain (rRT-PCR) to the nasopharyngeal strain.
The use of masks is promoted for those who are suspected of being infected with the virus and those who care for it.
Recommendation on the use of masks by the general public; some authorities recommend not using masks, some recommending its use, and some continue its use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antivirus treatment for COVID-19.
The transmission of local diseases has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
A person infected with the virus may experience symptoms such as flu, such as fever, itching, tiredness, and breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, hives or swelling in the chest, confusion, difficulty in getting up, and face or mouth swelling; medical advice is immediately recommended if these symptoms occur.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as hives, nausea, or sore throats, can be found, but they are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, are observed in several percentages.
A few cases in the early Tiongkok just with a clinical scan of the chest and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can develop into pneumonia, an organ failure, and death.
It's called incubation time.
The incubation time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can take from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who walk will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection, reports show that not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of a guide without these symptoms in the recovery is not yet fully known; however, early evidence shows that they may contribute to the preaching of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is not known and are being investigated, with the Control and Prevention Centre for Korean Diseases (KCDC) reports that 20% of all confirmed cases remain undetected during hospital visits.
The Tingkok National Health Commission began comparing the case without symptoms in its case on April 1st; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of the test.
Sputum and running water can carry the virus on a large scale.
Talk up and release more cracks or droplets than talk normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered stone could cause the droplets to drop to a height of 4.5 feet (15 m).
Although this virus is usually not produced by air, the United States National Academy of Sciences shows that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and the air collectors placed in the hallways outside the room produce a positive sample for RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can turn respiratory secretions into aerosols and spread over the air.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through feses, this risk is considered low. The virus is most effective when people walk around; although the preaching may happen before symptoms occur, the risk is low.
The European Disease Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) says that although it is not quite clear how easy this disease is, one person generally infected two to three others; this virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it has been found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard/cards, up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and hard steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on the 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on the color and temperature.
Sabine and detergen are also effective if properly used; soap products analyze the protective layer of virus, deactivation of the virus, and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Another route, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (infection of the disease), is less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, live water samples were taken in the middle of two days after the first treatment began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load at the second day's test.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which is first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to the acute respiratory disease cluster in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus features are on the coronavirus that's been working on the natural world.
Outside of the human body, this virus was killed by a domestic soap, which damaged its protective membranes.
Pupus is the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the dark cell through the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is the most common in the alveolar type II lung cell.
This virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spike or tonjolan" to connect to ACE2 and enter the dark cell.
Acute heart damage was found in 12% of the infected people who were treated with liver disease in Wuhan, Tigkok, and more frequently on severe diseases.
High cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disruption during disease development, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the ACE2 receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
Thrombosis (31%) and high venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in COVID-19 infected patients in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis. Otopsy to people who died from COVID-19 detected peripheral alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrate containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for respiratory epithelium cells expressing ACE2, COPID-19 patients have severe symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Especially, the T cell that surrounds the GM-CSF pathogens has been shown to be in line with the monosites that surround the IL-6 inflammators and severe lung pathology in the COVID-19 patient.
Infiltrate lymphocytes have also been reported in autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
Standard test method is the real-time (rRT-PCR) polymerase response.
This test is usually carried out on a breath sample obtained by means of a nasopharyng bat; however, a nasopharyng bat sample or a spittum may also be used.
In general, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it takes two samples of blood taken within two weeks to produce a small amount of time.
Tinkkok scientists are able to isolate this coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop an independent polymerase chain response test to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, an antibody test (which can detect active infections and if someone has previously been infected) was under development, but it was not yet widely used.
Tingkok’s experience with the test showed that it was only 60 to 70 percent of the time.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidance of the Zhongnan University University Hospital at Wuhan suggests a method to detect infections based on clinical imaging and epidemiological risk.
Multilateral background-glass opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and posterior multiples found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, paving crazy (seven-passing beats with varying alveolar fillings), and consolidation can occur along with disease development.
A little data is available about the microscopic acid and the COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathology finding on the autopsy is:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation, and pulmonary oedema
Four types of pneumonia virus can be treated:
light pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, large atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration, and the formation of giant cells means much
Pneumonia severe: DAD damage with diffuse alveolar exude.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory disease (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the recovery phase: exudation in the alveolar range and interstitial fibrosis lunger
Blood: intravascular coagulation of the diseminence (DIC); leukoerthroplastic reaction
Steps to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding a lot of places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with tissue when swallowing or sneezing and recommending the use of parts in the sieve if tissue is not available.
Hygiene’s hand is appropriate after it has been sneezed or sneezed.
The CDC recommends the use of a cover cover from a public place, some of which restricts the escape of unaccompanied persons. The social exclusion strategy aims to reduce the contact of people infected with many people, by closing schools and jobs, limit travel, and cancel large-scale meetings in public places.
In addition, the road to baptism involves keeping people at least six feet [6 m] or eight feet [1.8 m] in length.
There is no known effective cure to prevent COVID-19.Because the vaccine is expected not to exist until early 2021, the main part of managing COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemic peaks, known as the "curve settlement".
It is also recommended that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after washing from the toilet or when their hands are dirty, before eating, and after washing their noses, ankles, or linen.
Further CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand navigation that contains at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand navigation is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Peroxide hydrogen is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this is "not active nitrogen for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humectane.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include liquid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs that are affected.
CDC recommends people who suspect they bring viruses to wear a simple face mask.
The extracorporeeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to deal with respiratory failure, but its benefits are still considered.
Self - cleaning and lifestyle and eating patterns are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive care may be useful for people who have mild symptoms at the early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission Tingkok have published recommendations to deal with the ill-treated COVID-19.
Intensive care and lung patients in the United States have decided to recommend treatment from various institutions as a free resource, i.e. IBCC.
By April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some of the medical powers recommend parasetamol (astaminophen) compared to ibuprofen for first use in linen.
Preventive action should be taken to minimise the risk of virus recovery, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intruders or hand ventilation.
For health-care professionals dealing with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in the IRB except for standard prevention, contact prevention, and sound prevention activities. CDC provides guidance for the use of self-protection devices (APDs) during the pandemic.
The recommended device is: APD clothing, a respiratory or facial mask, eye protection, and a medical handkerchief. If available, the respiratory (not facial mask) is better.
The N95 Respirator is approved for industrial adjustment, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used on the basis of the U.S.
The N95 Respirator is designed to protect from particles such as dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not mentioned in the label.
If masks are not available, CDC recommends using face protection or, as a last attempt, self-made masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until they require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but most cases are very heavy.
The type of respiratory support for people who have failed to breathe associated with COVID-19 is being actively investigated for those who are treated with liver failure, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow ducts or bi-positive airflow pressure.
Whether one of these two methods produces the same benefits for those who suffer from a chronic illness is not yet known.
Most doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique limits the preaching of aerosol particles compared to a high flow duct.
Many developing countries do not have a hospital bed by a suitable captain, who restricts the health system's capacity to handle the sudden number of cases of COVID-19 that are severe enough to require care.
A study in Tingkok found that 5% of intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Tiongkok, about 30% of the COVID-19 patients who were finally treated in ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex than acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occurs at COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
A ventilator capable of doing high pressure control mode and PEEP is needed to maximize oxygen transmission at the same time to minimize the risk of lung injury and related pneumotorax.
High PEEP may not be available on an old fan.
Studies on treatment potential began in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are under clinical trial.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take time by 2021, some of the drugs that are being tested have been approved for other uses or have been tested further.
Antiviral drugs can be used to try people with serious diseases.
Volunteers recommended by WHO are also involved in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatment. FDA has provided temporary authorisation for plasma convalescent as experimental treatment in the case of a person's very or immediately at risk.
Convalesen plasma has not yet been studied in clinical trials necessary to prove the safety and efficacy of this disease.
In February 2020, Tingkok launched a mobile application to deal with this disease.
User is asked to insert their name and ID.
This application can detect 'close contact' using surveillance data so that it can detect the risk potential of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If a potential risk is detected, applications not only recommend the presence of quarantine, but also inform local health officials. Data analysis on phone data, facial detection technology, phone tracking, and intelligence used to track infected people and those who contact them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security body to track the expected coronavirus phone data.
That step was taken to deal with quarantine and to protect people who might be in contact with the infected population.
Also, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared telephone location data with the German federal government, Robert Koch Institute, in a series of studies and prevention of the virus.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine users.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was told by the phone operator that "40% of the population are still moving around."
The German government did the hackathon at the end of the week 48 hours with more than 42,000 players.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the preaching of coronavirus.
People may be pressured by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic downturn are perfect storms that endanger mental health and public health."
This disease can take place lightly with little or no symptoms, which are similar to the respiratory tract on the other side of the body, such as the hip.
Mildness usually occurs within two weeks, while those who suffer from severe or critical illness may need three to six weeks to heal.
Female pregnant women may have a higher risk for coovid-19 severe infections based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for coovid-19 is still low.
In the worst case, COVID-19 can develop rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or an organ failure.
Complications related to COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and heart, kidney, and heart damage.
Blood clotting differences, especially prothrombin time increases, were observed in 6% of patients treated with COVID-19, while the renal function difference was seen in 4% of these groups.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 picture show an increase in enzyme (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between stroke and death is ten days, with five days spent in obese care.
However, the patient transferred to ICU has a median time of seven days between carelessness and death.
In a study that examines early cases, the median time starts from early symptoms to death is 14 days, with a full break of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC), men have a death rate of 2.8%, while women have a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples shows alveolar damage emitted by cell fibromyxoid exudes in both lungs.
The cytopathetic changes of the disease virus on the pneumonia.
The picture is similar to the acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission, heart damage is buried, with an increase in troponin levels or heart rate.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people treated with cancer have a condition, and the availability of medical and social resources in a region can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary from region to region, but also from methodological difficulties.
At least a simple calculation could lead to an excessive number of deaths.
However, the fact that death is the result of a case that takes place in the past can mean the number of mortalitys currently being counted too low.
Percok has a probability of 1.4 times the most severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times the most likely need intensive care or death compared to that of a non-percocious one, and there are concerns about the duration of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital authorities found a 20 to 30 percent lung capacity drain on some sick people, and the lung scan showed organ damage.
This can also lead to intensive care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it is not known if previous infections give effective and long-term immunity to people who are cured of this disease.
Immunization may be obtained if you look at other coronavirus behavior, but there's been reports of a coovid-19 case followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days later.
This case is believed to be a malicious infection, not a reinfection.
This virus is believed to be natural and derived from animals, through widespread infections.
Originally unknown, but in December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely caused by human exacerbations.
A study on 41 cases confirmed by the first COVID-19, published in January 2020 at The Lancet, revealed the earliest trial date is December 1, 2019.
WHO's official publications report early on December 8, 2019.
In general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary from region to region and from time to time, and are affected by the number of tests, the quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first plague, and the character of population such as age, type of crime, and health in general.
At the end of 2019, WHO established an ICD-10 emergency code U07.1 for death caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the laboratory and U07.2 for the death caused by the COVID-19 clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cause of death for the case reflects the number of deaths for the number of diagnosed cases at a specified time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the cause of death to the global case is 6.9% (153,822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
Other measurements include the number of fatalities in the case (CFR), which represents the percentage of the diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and the number of infectious fatalities (IFR), which reflects the percentage of the infected (diagnosis and non-diagnosed) who died from certain diseases.
These statistics are timeless and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of people who have been infected.
At the spa epicenter in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) died.
In Gangelt, this disease was spread through the Carnival festival, which spreads to young people, causes relatively lower mortality, and probably not all deaths of COVID-19 are classified as COVID-19.
Moreover, the German health system has not yet broken down.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied by blood donors.
69 people (0.004 per cent of the population) died because of COVID-19.
The effects of the pancreas and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher for men in a study conducted in Tigkok and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with a different risk between men and new women not appearing at the age of 90.
In Tiongkok, the number of deaths for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The reason for this difference is not known, but genetic factors and behavior may be the reason.
Immunological differences based on the type of sex, the lower prevalence of smoking in women, and the men who have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected are men and 72% of the people who died because of COVID-19 are men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government did not track the related type of feline infection of COVID-19.
Research shows that viruses such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
The percentage of health officials with a higher gender profile, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of becoming exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is short for the crown, VI for the virus, D for the disease, and 19 for the first time the plague was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name is selected to avoid reference to a particular geographic location (e.g. Tigkok), animal species, or a group of people, indicating an international recommendation to prevent stigmatization. A virus that causes COVID-19 to be given the name coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses the "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in public communication.
Both the disease and the lesion virus are called coronavirus.
At the beginning of the plague in Wuhan, Tiongkok, the virus and this disease are called the "coronavirus" and the "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for the virus and disease according to the 2015 guidelines to avoid using the name location in the name of the disease and virus.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Because capacity constraints in the standard packaging chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal sprays and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital really needs a fan cap, and the cook can't give in the time needed, a local company goes back and prints 100 caps that were needed last night.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 plague, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and information appeared about origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of disease, which spread rapidly.
People seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, pigs, and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and COVID-19 drugs is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization used the "Solidarity Trial" to investigate the effects of the four life-threatening antiviruses that have been most promising.
Vaccines are not yet available, but a number of institutions are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous studies on SARS-COV were used for SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 in combination with ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under investigation.
First, research is aimed at creating a full virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, whether an inactive or dead virus, is intended to rapidly trigger the immune response of the human body to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, is to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits in the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focuses on S-spike proteins that help the virus narrow down the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is a nucleat asthma vaccine (a DNA vaccine or RNA, a new technique for making vaccines).
The experimental vaccine made with these strategies should be tested to find out its safety and reliability. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a non-hazardous genetic code derived from the virus that causes the disease. An increase in antibodies has been recommended as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials taking place in April 2020.
Seven tests try to evaluate the treatment that has been approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The antivirus drug that has been given a new purpose forms a large part of Tigkok's research, with nine tests of Phase III on remedesivir in some countries with a record of reporting time at the end of April.
In April 2020, dynamic research on clinical development for vaccine candidates and COPID-19 medicinal products has been carried out. Some antivirals that are being evaluated for the treatment of COPID-19, which include remedesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir are combined with beta interferons.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence of remdesivir survival.
Clinical increases were observed in patients treated with remedesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being carried out in the US, Tingkok, and Italy. Chlorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, was first examined in Tingkok in February 2020.
However, there is a call to investigate the subject.
Korea's health authorities and Tinkkok recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending the daily dose of one gram, notes that the dose is twice as dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the policy of a doctor who treats the suffering of COVID-19.The 7th edition's Tionkok version also highlights interferon, ribavirin, or omifenevir to be used against COVID-19.
The initial data showed that a high dose of ribavirin is needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing SARS-CoV-2 decommissioning at low concentrations.Research shows that the initial premium for tonal protein by serum protease transmembrane 2 (TMPRSS2) is very important for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through an interaction with ACE2 receptor.
A study on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has a major limitation that has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro and does not have a known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The sitokin storm complication can occur on the COVID-19 heavy stage.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antisytokin properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission Tingkok after a small study has been completed.
This drug is undergoing a phase 2 test at national level in Italy after showing positive results to people with severe diseases.
Combined with serum ferritin tests to identify the cytokine storm, this medicine is meant to fight the cytokine storm, which is expected to be the cause of death on some of the most affected.
In 2017, antagonism receptor interleukin-6 was approved by the FDA based on a study of a retrospective case for the treatment of cytokine refractory steroid release syndrome induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
So far, there's no random and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an appropriate treatment for CRS.
Transfer the clean-up and implanted antibody produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need it is being considered as a passive non-vaccinal immunization method.
This strategy has been tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Neutralization of the virus is a mechanism of work that is expected for passive antibody therapy to mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cell cytotoxicity that rely on antibodies and/or phagositis, are also possible.
The form of other passive antibody therapy, such as monoclonal antibody, is being developed.
Convalescent serum production, which is part of the liquid from the patient's blood that has been healed and contains specific antibodies to this virus, can be improved for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Hospital Wuhan Hospital, who then fell down and died because of COVID-19 after the outbreak of the virus.
