Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and the destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-State resolution under discussion is also to be tackled.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticises the ongoing construction of the Israeli settlement and advocates Netanyahu's lack of will in the peace process.
The deal that Obama has taken on the Iranian nuclear program has further aggravated the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, which was partly valued as a front against Obama.
The speech was not in agreement with Obama, and this meeting had indicated that he had rejected his current election in Israel.
In a hurry, Professor, have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency, Professor Shannon Lamb told with a somewhat curious voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house the officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note that was criticised on a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted to make it back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb had made the hanging emergency some time later.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police stabbed him.
One day after the shooting at the university, students and teachers forced themselves to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to take a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal precedent.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful men", with whom he shared his academic life.
Both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which includes 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some trends in problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that at the end of the academic year 2014-15 he had to deal with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for permission for health reasons and said he had any health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion, for which the Lamb had worked so hard, would not provide him with a guarantee of an automatic way to an appointment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After the flight from the campus, the police found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb himself killed a .38 Caliber Gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the entrance.
It wasn't immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she thought he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
In the spring he promoted in pedagogy.
One of the longtime Lambs friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met together.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to play the guitar for a few years.
He was the woman's fever at the time.
All the girls melt there while he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in Jackson's suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss evidently had some time together.
In the emergency, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no warrant from a hero.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the Backstein House, which is adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they were divorced 15 years ago, but they had friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old now.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer year market three years ago.
Later, they played one or two gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night on September 5th for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and oral harmony game before a special audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and messing with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar programme and specialized in American natives and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the Student Committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including teachers, employees, students and members of the community, attended a Christmas celebration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Mahnwache, while the "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" were singing.
The course will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say Lamb was making the emergency after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency was named Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two had ever been married.
Toys R Us plans to set less workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the employees and seasonal workers who are currently employed with him a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to invest 40,000 people in shops and sales centres all over the country. In the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 workers were set up.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start with application talks and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is closer, and companies are preparing to set up timers to provide stores with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was professionally a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sit in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a prominent documentary film "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it makes sense to me that I am a simulated gang and an arm length away from being with the princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had premiered 30 years ago.
"It really is for me," said Spielberg, "unquestionably the biggest time travel film ever turned."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected movies in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the almost five years lasting conflict, and more weapons will only become worse for millions of people.
The UN Chief again calls on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to join and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the UK and France - on the occasion of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the revelations in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional authorities "make this situation unresolved."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they had demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Surveyes that show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have made him a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks in surveys down, it hasn't (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump leading in the two-digit area, and some start to wonder seriously what it means to nominate the real estate mogul.
Of course it's too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time Rick Perry's leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain, from which not only won a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he should have fought in a general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's assets and start letting their dollars flow to crush him.
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey of Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Six of 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are held in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of the Republicans had a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said they would be either "joiced" or "satisfying" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "enraged" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson achieves about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would "be excited" vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next in matters of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "suffered" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombing and poignant statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temper for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation's first pre-election state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicans think he has the personality for a commander, says Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 independent people say that his temper does not fit into the White House, as ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they set up their training huts, Republican voters hold Trump for real.
If they are asked who wins the GOP nomination first, they say after a survey of CNN/ORC from last week four out of ten that Trump is the best bet.
That's a change since the time they put their money on Jeb Bush from the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters in the past did not have the clearest crystal ball.
At that time, in the last cycle, four of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidate in the middle of Romney.
However, it turns out that a number of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beat almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the split field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while the anti-trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey at Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-on-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump collects the majority support.
He has 13 points in front of Carly Fiorina, 14 points in front of Marco Rubio, 15 points in front of Walker, 19 points in front of Jeb Bush and 33 points in front of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-on-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beat him?
Ben Carson would take over the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-on-head race.
A few majority of Donald-Trump fans say they've formed their opinion.
A new survey of CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters supporting the Trump say they have given their votes.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change the opinion.
46% said they let the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the time of the other external pages, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violent" in his election campaign two months ago, immigration was a turning point and starting point in the public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombing of Trump's decisive Hispano-Americans will be kept away from the Republican Party and damage the new orientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the ramp light, Donald Trump will appear to do it too.
The frustration over the government climbs to new heights.
In the meantime, Donald Trump and Ben Carson disappears around half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their foreign status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, they prefer to be a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three of four Iowa Republicans were frustrated about the Republicans at the Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "Hellishly angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residents of Germany
Here in Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential facility - overlooking the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter of a riding roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," says the study - therefore, the high price.
A new study shows which special layers cost most a square meter.
Of course, 18,70 Euro per square meter for a student offer in Munich are not really small.
In contrast to the German Top Wohnorten, however, one of the prizes is presented as Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residences - with square meters prices in swinging heights.
There are once several tens of thousands of Euros nothing - per square meter, well marked.
But, well, who can afford it...
In other words, Munich is not at the top of the road.
Champions League: Bayern Dream Start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double Torschütze in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserving 3:0 at Olympiako's Piraeus - then lived.
A sovereign performance of the Champions League season.
World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have protected FC Bayern in the Hexenkessel of Piraeus a dream start in the "Mission Milan".
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won her performance at the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a warm atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52/90.+2) and Götzes hitter (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start-up success in the series will be the first step towards finals on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get to Munich in the third run.
Müller received good help from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto at his 28th meeting at the Bayern League Championship, which was thought to be the world champion's flagship.
"We will not underestimate them," said Bayern-Captain Philipp Lahm before the game at Karaisakis Stadium before 3.1,688 hot-flowered fans - and the Munich kept the word.
They showed a concentrated and engaged imagination without glancing.
Piraeus had won his last six home games in the royal class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atletico Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) also drowned.
But the Bavarians, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They courageously went to work, but they often failed to do so in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were launched too often by the game shift on the left-hand Douglas Costa, who rarely survived the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellauui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flange from the right half-field in the upper left toreck.
In the 67th minute the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiako's storm Ideye Brown hit Poland's headball off the line (26th).
Then, by direct removal, Torwart Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians used to pull her dominant game, Piraeus was able to put needles.
On Torhütter Manuel Neuer, however, he was released.
For example, when he shot a shot of Ideye over the latte (56.).
Before New, Guardiola had a four-stringed with David Alabama in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did it well.
Mario Gotze, after muscle problems back in the box, sat out first.
The WM-Head has only given green light after the final training, sports chief Matthias Summer said at "Sky": "Whoever wants to do something else out of it, it's already bad."
In the first change, Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the attacked Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, after 11 meters, Müller set up another one.
Before the game, it was at the stadium to crawl.
After a small group of alleged Bayern fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and marched with strikes against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bavarian fan was transported injured from the stadium.
Whoever smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Whoever smokes does not only damage the lung, but also the teeth - this puts a Potsdamer long-term study close.
The good news: If you refuse, the risk is reduced quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DifE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth in advance to increase the 2.5- to 3.6-fold.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth decay are caries and inflammations of the tooth flesh, the DifE stresses.
For these parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to more frequent dental burns in smokers.
It is not clear how much smoking also increases the risk to careers.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, however, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years to reduce the risk to the level of non-smokers, first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham explained.
People had to be convinced not to smoke, studied director Heiner Boeing of the DifE explained: "Smoking shortens life."
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and also leads to good dental health to high age.
In Germany, more than 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by tooth loss, the DifE reported.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth decay.
The new long-term study undermines the findings.
Archaeologists hit Cologne Rheinifer on the remains of late antiques
Archaeological finds have been made at the right Rheinifer in Cologne.
Close to the building site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German-Museum Skelette and the rest of historical buildings have dug out, said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work at the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called soil paints.
At all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always raised as a professional for archaeological soil care.
In the third section of the Rheinboulevard the archaeologists have now been found.
It has already been known from text documents that in the 4th century there was a fortress and in the 8th century a church, explained Trier.
In addition to the rest of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman of good-will
After a young woman at the railway station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern is disappointed, the federal police ask the population for help.
On the morning of the morning at 1.40 p.m., the woman from the direction of the railway station building crossed the track at the end of the train station and was picked up by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, the recording of the train caused serious injuries.
She was treated notaryly on site and was taken to a hospital by rescue forces.
There are no findings about the reason for the nightly crossing of the track of the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have received acoustic perceptions.
Inquiries come from residents or passengers from Linderner Train, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information given about the cause of the accident can be provided on the clock and free hotline of the Federal Police by telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute with TTIP
To tighten the dispute over the planned transatlantic Free Trade Agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The contested private separatist institutions for disputes between groups and states are therefore to be resolved by a more transparent system, which, in its functioning, clearly corresponds to more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström explained in his presentation.
Sweden intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
Through TTIP, the world's largest free trade zone of 800 million people is to be created.
The plans to reform the current divorce proceedings specifically provide that the EU and the US will jointly elect independent judges for a new investment court.
They are intended to come from the EU, the USA and third countries as equal.
For the first time, there is also a second instance.
She would allow it to raise objections to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed with each other on arbitration, and there has been no opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion last month, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it intends to work on an International Investment Court according to its own data.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be resolved.
The investor-State split procedures (ISDS) required by large groups are considered to be one of the main reasons for Europe's major resistance to TTIP.
The traditional divorce courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel litigation, against which companies are subject to the burden of tax payers, subject to national laws or are able to enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations, such as Campact, referred to the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.
In particular, it was criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated Free Trade Agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Secretary of State Matthias Machnig (SPD) referred to the plans as major progress.
The Commission takes into account the essential points of the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel has worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private divorce courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Business Europe Association warned against limiting the opportunities of the economy by too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been taking place since mid-2013.
However, the topic of investor protection has not so far been discussed with the United States.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year.
This date shall be deemed to be no longer sustainable.
Delicate people of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Seventeen years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a Flipchart, on which the fearsome folk singer recorded the picturesque state of Michigan with pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost captured by Steven's speech.
He tells from different places that he always sign on the map, about which he reports his minutious and sarcasm-ordered songs.
Where they were created, and what it looks like, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative liar.
With the release of 2003 and the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs that are very harmoniously close to the American people of the late 1960s, but can always be very opulent.
The rumor is that "Michigan" would be the first part of a referenced series: each of the 50 US states is to be defeated as a result.
However, in 2004 and in the vicinity of the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared, and has given rise to some positive expectations.
Reduced, Stevens comes up here.
Live enough for him guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musicians who live in New York return to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invitations You To: Come on Feel The Illinois"), 2005 will be a highly celebrated masterpiece.
Overcoming ideas and stylistic fines.
The album climbs into the American Billboard Charts and lacks in any year's best list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then serves on "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic spare parts.
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and halls.
At the length of the smaller clubs, the stage shows will be presented here as a colourful spectacle of neon star bands and large fluorescent staged cobblestones.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens is part of a five-head band through Germany.
In the dark kept hamburger More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests are now confined in their chairs, the clearly mature Stevens returns to intimacy and to the people.
Without giving a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear: the lecture is "opulenter" and this allows you to throw away the plates in principle.
Only to an addition thanks to Stevens modest, acoustically plays a few older songs and finally declines under a thousandth of applause.
Jeremy Corbyn Debüt at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn Debüt has been looking forward to the Prime Minister's question.
The new Labour President, Jeremy Corbyn, will give his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time, and will first place himself with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will raise himself to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance being probably verified by the media and the Labour Members from nearby.
He called for "less theaters and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings in order to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corby's leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Chairman, during Tuesday during the singing of the National Hymne at a memorial to the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence, has provoked criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is at the centre of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corby's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention to itself.
One speaker of Mr. Corbyn said he would have "stand in respectless silence" and recognized the "heldendom of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle around England".
But a member of Mr. Corby's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Nights Program that he had arrived at the Labour Chair to sing the national hymns "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corby's team, and they relied on differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader.
The BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stumbled" within Labour, according to Mr. Corby's statements on the position of the European Union and the restriction on profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour has made changes to remove the whole idea of a total restriction.
Hours later, Mr. Smith told the shadow workers and rent ministers that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman, David Cameron, since he is the head of Tory, who has been on the side of the Dispatch Box in Parliament for the past decade.
The Labour Chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Icelandic North MP has said that the Prime Minister's questions are too confrontational and that he will be left to "fighting" and fight counter-hackles and instead concentrate on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow minister of the economy, would represent him if he did not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on his way abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the word, and that he had called John Bercow, the speaker of the Sub-House, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to get away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre" which is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time. But a few years later, he admitted that he had given up on it.
Since she was first broadcast on television in 1990, the question hour with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the basement and his position among his colleagues in Parliament, although critics have argued that she has become a cartoon and needs extensive reforms.
'Grosses in Joburg': homeless young people trained to photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a rough spot when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn their livelihood.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take pictures from their surroundings and earn a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
In parallel, FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, the result without bonus in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9 % over the same period of the previous year.
Since 2009, this percentage has been the fastest and most estimated at the time of a rise in interest.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was reduced to 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index was increased by 1,49 % to 6,229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20% after taking over the rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods.
Richemont's latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - again reported growth.
Glencore's shares increased by 5% after the mining said he had taken $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the Mondi packaging and paper group were the biggest losses on the index, with a decrease of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs put his estimate on "sales" for the company.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the year.
The leader of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion.
JD Sports Manager Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs of its company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber-Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
21-year-old lipstick, a handle with over-shipped hair.
The type with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros hard.
Even more.
Now Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going through.
Like Victoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone plate in front of the Berlin luxury hotel at the Potsdamer Square.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live an idol whose poster has been hanging up in Stettin since Monday night.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs just as much as her mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If not at all.
She says, "In fact, my Victoria had to sit in the tenth grade in gymnastics."
"I fulfill her dream."
Compulsory?
Who's kidding?
The fans don't.
Not even Bieber himself.
He never made it.
For advertising in the Superbowls advertising break, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pixel firm, many, many dollars on the beer account.
And with every doll that looks like it and the ladentic, Bieber also throws off.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you stay on the window.
He's supposed to have taken over over 100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others stress that Bieber was finally in the United States and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album should follow in November, the many zeros are not interested for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida Plakat brings Lebanese on potatoes
Potatoes or thunders?
It is both - and it is in the potatoestones developed by the oldenburg Imbisholder Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the phrase "cartoffel instead of Doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay Cartoffel and meat have stuck together on a spear.
The idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the title "Cartoffels instead of Doner", which he had accidentally seen on TV.
Since then, in his shop there is a barbecue that is filled with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculture for the stomach," Alhay says.
The idea has now been introduced by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
It has been protected, according to the Authority's information, for a short time as a pattern of use.
So how much meat and how much potatoes the spirit contains, Alhay doesn't want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
Also with its customers, the culinary understanding of the peoples is good.
Metcash launches soil resistance campaign to fight Aldi impact
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Metcash food wholesaler has launched a soil resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as through events like Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as icemaker Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA shops and shop owners, and sell the registered tickets to loyal customers for the South Australian football.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29th when the wholesaler carries out his annual investor strategy day.
There is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA charging business and generate higher profit margins than Metcash IGA network in the East States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to about 14 per cent in the East.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will be removed about five percent of the food market in these two countries 12 months after the opening of its first market and all existing players, but mainly independent retailers, will lose sales.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and achieve a sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Metcash high fixed-cost basis could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most reliable.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's turnover in the food and food business will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and the market share of 14% in 2015 will fall to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, the chief fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told in a business in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to react publicly to Mr Douglas' comments.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash has contacted Mr Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has decreased from 18 percent since 2010 to 14 percent, and revenue from Metcash's food and food trade, which has been provided by some 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction at the same time pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by improving fast-growing fresh food and providing a better choice of private label food.
Metcash's CEO, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and charging processes will be applied to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "Collateral Damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgyos and deserves, in the view of the president of the Australian tennis club Steve Healy rather than criticism of his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is always referred to as "Special Ks", runs into the Rampenlicht by the announced confrontation of Kyrgyos with Stan Wawrinka at Montreal Masters.
In a fiery skill game in Cincinnati shortly thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the judge of divorce, with Harrison saying, "Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgyos, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen defeating a tennis player after a crash defeated a potential U.S. open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was constantly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for the second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup-Half final against the UK.
"One thing that I think I'm quite familiar with is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi was a little involved in the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a battle when he lost in the US open due to a crash, but he is not the first player who broke a battle out of Frost with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US openings, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the dressing area, he's trained hard, he's good in form, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgyos into account in the important advance decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term fixed component to the team."
"First, we wish that the team is fully focused on competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick has managed to get up very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside of the ramp light, where he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and determined that everyone was trying to get into the country illegally. All with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a non-Serb country and Serbian officials responded with encouragement.
The people who had fled to the streets for an unknown time lay on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and lay down there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police raider swooped over them, the migrants ran "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian emergency police.
Some show off from protest food and water back.
Serbia's Foreign Minister stated that it was "unacceptable", that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border was unable to agree on a common immigration policy one day after the 28-nation block at a meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overcrowded Italy and Greece, and they expressed their hope that an agreement would be reached by the end of the year – next month or by the end of the year – that the EU States would include another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes on a swift action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The situation that arose on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto said that his country also plans to build a stacked crane along its border to Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to create the Stacheldrat-Zaun between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become a major hub for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and an entry point for the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most incoming economic refugees are seeking a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - an opinion that is strongly in opposition to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which enter into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4-metre (13 feet), which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"Because of the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say very clearly: Illicit border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but Reporters of Associated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for a long time.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Adviser for Orban, said that 45 people were already more deeply involved in the country when the authorities tried to cross the border.
They come over by damaging the zoo, they are now in police custody, and they are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are about to repair the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a train wagon with stacked wire to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and press a multitude of people to enter it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in national survey
Former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to have a two-digit lead in the democratic race to nominate at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her against the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 per cent of the democratic voters in the elections (58 per cent previously), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 per cent (an increase of 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidency, receives 15 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections.
More than five months before the elections, most democratic voters say it's too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS-News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has gained some profits.
Clinton has a great advantage in women and men, but these advantages have decreased.
Their support for men is clearly reduced, and Sanders is back here with only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under 50 has fled, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage in the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with a two-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the elections across the country say they would be happy to support Clinton if she was nominated by the party.
One quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because they are the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Maybe it's not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly excited about her.
The views are more mixed with those who don't currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with problems and selectivity is also cited.
Since the Vice-President throws a potential for the President's office into the Waagscale, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not.
If democratic voters of the elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Clinton's followers say more than half that Biden's second choice would be far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead towards Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, this figure has decreased by 78 percent in the last month.
Biden is a second in this measurement at a distance, but the percentage that sees him as the "chosenest" has increased.
Nevertheless, when it comes to the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters call questions about the eligibility.
Like in the last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate for these electors of the elections is ineligible.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates will produce good results in some important features in voters of their party's choice.
Most people view Clinton, Sanders and Beden as honest and confidential and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
The three candidates are best cut off by honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not believe in him.
Democratic voters of the elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's continued use of a personal e-mail address and a server during the term of office as a foreign minister are still asked, most democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their views in general.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was split in March shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsened.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of ten who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is regarded by the voters of its party as honest and confidential, this remains a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent view them as honest and confidential, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of the electors do not consider them to be honest and confidential.
At the same time, 55 percent of the country's eligible people also view Trump as not honest and not confidential.
However, Clinton and Trump receive good grades in leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush cut off the best in honesty.
A majority look at Sanders rather than honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson comes up in a countrywide survey near the back of Donald Trump
Ben Carson is in the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates are currently missing half of the voter support in the new survey, and others are dramatically losing hold
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers throughout the country. Support increases by 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson dropped from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is well-attended in demographic groups and that Trump excels among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the worst, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are 6% in the third place.
The error margin for the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was performed in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is increasing in the survey - it has 19% support for the Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly in front of Carson.
Looking at a carson rising last week, Trump found some side points for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for asking Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Comfortable bath temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm to 29 degrees.
Even if peaks are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for swimmers to find hot water.
A bath in the North or East Sea may be a shorter pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go to the sea: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and the East Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) shares.
However, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east there is even up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees away.
Five members of the brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College-Neuling
Almost two years after a student died during a shaky ritual of a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, death, murder charges against five people are filed.
Members of the New Yorker Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi-Bristership attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 brutally and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police informed him.
Officials said that he was loaded with eyes connected with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while he was trying to go over a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Society did not call 911 after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, as the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, throw out his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng to contact the national presidents of the brotherhood to get advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point the members began to hide tools and put the welfare of the brotherhood in principle over that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He couldn't be slaughtered again, and he died in his injuries the next morning.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with strong force injuries to the head, rump and neck.
"Many families have been destroyed by the Skikanes of the brotherhood. At least one student has died to the Skikanes since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brothers and their members must be taken into account, and this step by the authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third degree murder charge for the first five members.
Twenty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also accused of having been attacked and brought up by a criminal association.
"We do not only want to make the parties responsible, but if there is an organization that - officially or informally - has sanctioned this, we will also take them into account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has withdrawn its membership to the local group.
This will happen when the feed increases the interest
A rise in interest is coming, and the house is going to collapse, interest is going to rise for loans, and the economy is going to rise to a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long all this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history for the economy provides only a small guide to the end.
A recession occurred within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, although not always, a factor in how the economy and financial facilities react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when they start to increase interest rates, but rather on the time needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "picture money," said Julian Jessop, a chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still to a low level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effects.
Here is a historical trend based on how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen in the last month, the advance of interest increases can make things more volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for assets to be rejected 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," said Deutsche-Bank analysts in a new study to what happens after the interest increases of the fed.
More precisely, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest, rather flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal state after 500 days, with an average yield in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Head of Plant Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the growth cycle and the income starts to decrease.
Reactions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is of utmost importance that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an increase in the interest of the feed.
According to Deutsche Bank, at 118 interest increases since 1950, the nominal GDP was only twice below 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few expect this to take place and expect only 1.5 per cent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed data.
Increases in interest rates in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question, "It is different this time," said the Deutsche Bank.
Market participants focused all year round on an increase in the interest rate of the Fed, and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strata and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, the future trade is only a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study, all growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super-cycle with increasing pressure on GDP and pre-recession heights very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows," the report said.
In contrast, this is a clear slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is at a distance of the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are up to 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market is expected to increase interest, and the pattern is quite similar as on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of loans, the income appears to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the borrowers fell immediately, the Deutsche Bank said.
The strata of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer collection of income between longer and shorter bonds and to a deflating of the curve.
High-level loans often produce better returns in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the view of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is smoother, credit rates have expanded and volatility has increased - all features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
In general, companies that deal with most of their business in the United States will benefit from increasing interest rates and attracting local products.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts.
"History shows that "quality" shares tend to react positively three months after an initial increase in interest," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a customer report.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have averaged 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their pendants with low quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debts are going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savings could see gains through higher earnings, even if experts of different opinions are how fast this will take place.

Parliament's colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims to be a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the sender to prove that he is doing something that private broadcasters do not do.
Conservative Senator Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio broadcaster was "insanity" and that he was increasingly no different from his commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 doesn't seem - I don't like to use the word "dumping" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appear to be only under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two examples called spontaneous, in which you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director General pointed out the proposals and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public disclosure.
What I learn from Radio 3 I'm going to learn about classical music nowhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to commission new works, I'm also really important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that it had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production, however, which, during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, was under fire to bring commercial rivals to the feet.
The Tory Senator Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly noticeable?
Lord Hall stated that the BBC 1-show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "on a special BBC basis".
He added, he hopes that the company will find "a hit from our own home stable" when it next starts a series of entertainment.
However, he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to issue the fees for other forms of entertainment.
Internet exchanges are the slowest in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the start of the recordings in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for sale
Experts believe that the Black Friday has stopped spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs that the online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth rate since the start of the census in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there is evidence that online sales stagnate after new numbers show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, then this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG Sales Index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to shop with their phones.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now this is happening, and we may experience that growth decreases.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the residual sales.
Experts believe that buyers keep their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers fell to their computer to make their wallets, and some dealers' websites collapsed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, on which buyers fought because of the cut, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that a little more than £5 expenditure was spent online.
In some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now carried out via web-shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of the people buy clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashionnets in the inner cities.
Muslims buried those killed in Mecca during the Kran accident - Bin Laden's family is being punished
The bodies of 29 dead are borne by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partially charges the collapse of the huge Saudi bin-load group
The Ministry of Health said that in addition, 394 people were injured after the crash
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane broke down on Mecca's Great Mosque.
Regrettably, largely dressed in white, the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead entered their last trip to the Al-Moaisem-Freedhof.
The mourning process moved over to the Holy Place, where only days before a boulder came through the cover of the mosque and then fell on the bees.
The bodies were released for execution when the Saudi King imposed a penalty on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 better people killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Great Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly promised that the Haddsch to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the bin-load group should not have left the arm of the crane until it was used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said that the bin-load group was responsible for the collapse.
The English service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's leadership was prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the storm of the crane to collapse in an inner courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before Haddsch, which later took place in this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not issue statements on the collapse of the cranes and their representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also destroyed the group because of non-current security measures and because it had not cooperated with meteorologists.
Hundreds of cranes surround Mecca as part of the massive construction project led by the bin-load group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is undertaking larger construction projects.
The dead leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a distraught son, who was rejected by the family in the 1990s.
The overthrow of the crane came in the middle of strong winds and rains, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for pilgrim travel, which is at least once needed in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people are staying in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (£ 174,000) be paid to the members of the victims and the same amount to permanent victims.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European artisans is over
Britain is increasingly employed by artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe has risen behind them
This leads to the opening of 200 additional Screwfix downloads targeting handicrafts
At the same time, Kingfisher 60 B&Q sales outlets will close the countrywide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britain lowers its barriers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European artisans who carry out the work at home
If you are able to handle a hammer or a brush to tighten the walls, you appear to belong to a minority today.
Because Britain increasingly employs handicrafts to carry out homework jobs in their homes, the company's head behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe, the services offered at low prices, were currently being met.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 additional Screwfix shops, which are directed to handicrafts and close 60 sales sites of B&Q.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are made by women.
At the moment, the men are superior to the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that are taking more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There's still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to shift this to a greater balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, who is one of only five women leading company at the top of a British FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 per cent of the team with women, including its management and financial management.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find good women for our board of supervisors.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in the half-year’s earnings and sales after the group paid the costs for closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, the Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Functionaries of Aich/Dob because of mistrust in court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt, on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vizemeister Aich/Dob have to be responsible for their mistrust and tax evasion.
The defendants are not guilty.
One of them was also accused of abuse.
From this proposal he was legally acquitted in May.
The current process has been lost.
According to Prime Minister Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, the defendants had been crystallised to use funds from associations that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
The damage is about 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also accused of financial misconduct.
This fact was distinguished by the president of the Creation Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
For the rejection of the faithless, the defence was that at no time was a asset to the association.
The sports officials had only calculated the damage caused by expense and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and which they invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings in 2001 (EUR 44,000).
"At that time, we stood before the situation: Do we lead the club further or do we stop?" said one of the defendants, in the brothel Big Business Examiner of the Finance Office.
With his colleague and co-rapporteur, he then decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We have set up money, placed our life insurance as security at the bank," he said when he agreed.
It was agreed with the association: you can manage the money freely; it must not be done in any way.
In addition, it was decided - in financial terms - that the payment of the damage caused by the expenditure had been repaid in a negative way until 1991.
Therefore, a part of the damage caused was paid only years later, that is, from the year 2003, when a plus was on the account.
Therefore, pauscal and non-departmental bookings appeared, the former Obmann explained the proceedings.
The accounts and savings books jointly managed the two accused, the second accused said.
Why the payments were not made to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association has not been interested in the details of the financial contribution; it is important that it was only the freedom of debt, so the answer.
As a result of official abuse, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account when a functional investigation began in 2011.
The defendants explained that these were a setback.
This paper account was on behalf of the second accused and was not known to the association according to its statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The questionnaire did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he finally thought he believed this was the best for the association.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The co-rapporteur was informed, the officer justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a "damaged recovery".
Why do you want to know about damage?, the judge and the state attorney.
The first defendant stated that he had not agreed with this wording because the association had never been damaged.
But what am I supposed to do when the lawyer says, "You're all out of the cut."
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never paid a cent worth, he calculated only kilometer money and diets.
He took into account the company's diets of 1,000 euros a month, but he added that the actual effort was much higher.
The defendants were not able to present precise documents for the previous years.
These were no longer stored after an operating test in which everything was assessed as correct, they explained.
The second defendant had also been charged with kilometre money.
All the repairs were in the bar, and he had to drive from his village of Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main debate will continue on 23 September with the examination of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard covers another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the three years that have been in progress, the computer rise will reduce further jobs in the company's fragmentation.
There is no end to the job strings at the U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP).
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce the number of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its company customer.
As a result, costs of $2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion) were to be saved, the company informed on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special load of about 2.7 billion dollars, which will fall from the fourth quarter.
The three-year reduction of 55,000 jobs has not yet been completed.
By the end of the financial year 2013/14, HP had more than 302,000 employees.
After all, the Hewlett packaged stock accounted for 2.3 percent.
The group that grew up with printers from the Californian Palo Alto currently split up: So the computer and printer business is still to be merged into a new society - separated from the more challenging areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business parts are to be listed at the stock exchange.
A further disappointing PC charge, as well as a weaker demand for company customers for its services, recently added to Lenovo's second-largest PC manufacturer worldwide.
In the third business quarter to the end of July, the paragraph of PC and printers went back by 11.5 percent.
The turnover fell by 8 percent to almost $25.4 billion.
Thus, the ransom went back in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a break-in and massive job strikes on the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only recently reacted to the fact that customers strengthen smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online at the same time.
Whitman's restructuring plans foresee the total reduction of around 55,000 seats.
Conflicts: Most support the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in Iraq's fights would largely result in rejection: 54 per cent spoke against, 35 per cent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying air against the IS in Iraq and Syria makes 61% positive.
24% are in conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian ruler Baschar al-Assad denied 51 per cent of the respondents, 20 per cent for that.
29% could not decide.
Car: Second Press Day on the 66th IAA

After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Car Exhibition under the motto "Mobility Linked" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA of Saturday.
The organizers of the VDA Car Association count as two years ago with about 900,000 visitors.
Röszke: violence against the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have deployed on the Serbian border at Röszke Tränengas and water towers against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Daniel Bozsik has experienced the violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
After that, a police line had formed and behind the police stood a water tower.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles after the officers.
The officers first set up an uninterrupted pepper spray.
Then the police used Trengengas.
Many trengengas have been sprayed toward the refugees.
So the group was dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the area.
Children who had taken in the train gas scream.
Other refugees fell together and left under breath.
The Serbian police press also suffered injuries from the use of Trengengas and Pepperspray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Bank
The world is watching when the US notary bank meets in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether or not the interest will be raised for the first time for almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half the last week of the view that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will continue a little longer and that interest rates will be maintained at the current rate of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been here seven years since the Fed interest was put on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Head of Staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good level of performance, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a little inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.

Death shot at Delta State University left apologizing
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues and killed them later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it was "to kill him" at the first murder and wanted to make it invisible," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, Professor of Geography and Social Science at Delta State University, reported the emergency number at 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning
And said, "He shot someone and killed someone."
Lamb told the emergency department staff that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" was in the house, but "no one will disturb", but he'll probably be upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it to him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found Amy Prentiss' body, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening, when the police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "threefold relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they had been married for about seven years as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, which is 19, and she was "damaged on the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had met Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "Don't go to jail."
When the police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, ran away, walked into the woods and killed himself with a gun.
Lamb received a doctoral title from Delta State University in spring 2015, as his life course on the University website indicates.
Stars that lost their lucky bringer
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor also reportedly has to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of possession of drugs.
I'm sure all this calls for his tributary.
Eurowings: Lufthansa built the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group building.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation.
150 of the world's 1000 executives will pay the job.
With the pilot union, there are new negotiations.
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and values the Eurowings.
The aim of the re-establishment was to make a profit or loss contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost- and recovery synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
For example, there is no board for the passenger business in the future at Lufthansa.
The Eurowings ticket should be developed as independently as possible.
In the board team around Chef Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future.
With the re-establishment, the track underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to take action against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120 000 employees was a complex company.
The airlines signed under the roof of the Airline Passage Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the cockpit (VC) pilot association, the negotiations are scheduled to be resumed after the strike on Thursday.
That's what the union shared.
The topic of the conversation should be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to come "in a year with a predictable record result" as quickly as possible sustainable results.
The conflict between unions and airlines has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision of the pilots, the concept of "Wings" is the background.
It is anticipated that Lufthansa, in the fight against competitors, will set off routes to the Group's Eurowings Billiglinie.
Under the title "Morgenzug in the South", paintings by Leena Krüger are to be seen in the artist's house.
For a long time now, Finnin, located in Göttingen, has compiled a selection of titleless works for the White Hall of the House, which encourage its viewers to go on a trip.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffers from a double fracture of his right leg at Manchester's Champions League at PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left foreign defender to the wine and will exclude him for at least six months from the game, Louis van Gaal does not give hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The injury was caused by an unwarranted attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old show broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the playground for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operating in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it's very hard and then plays fantasticly, and then it happens.
He had an oxygen mask in the dressing room.
He's not crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to be missing a red card and hanging an eleven meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the judge, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian judge was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an 11 meter and a red card were missing.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said: "Thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how I am broken, my path to recovery begins now, I will come back stronger."
Related to this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat of the PSV
The England Defender with the European Championship in France has an additional incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this type of injury leaves the room, all are very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent.
Moreno suffered a bone fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the WM 2014.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then if you hear that it's a very bad injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction, so it looked like he [moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In the conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard this can be.
I feel really bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a game by Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
It's a thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't last long until you know it almost externally.
Maybe you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, the environmental facilitator of Dr. Seuss, appeared in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "sudden, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give a picture or message that we've missed so far."
Everything is nice and good, except that the next paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book, instead reflects a content of the 2012 film version, which added the new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the middle of the walled town of Thnead-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a young man named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by seeing her desire to see a real tree," he read. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose true name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991 but was completely unknown.
As if this would not be suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film that is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and begins: "In the walled town of Thnead-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a product, a young man named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey's dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the book. Here is an unnamed boy, like the local environment through the money-making, falling trees, shriveled once-strikingler despite the protests of the so-called Lorax, a horrifying, narrow-minded being, "who speaks in the name of the trees", is being devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times each other.
A Downing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
To hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the box chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series is not on my map.
I would not exclude an outside victory.
Alastair Cooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Batting setting, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars from 2012, only a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related message: Adam Lyth departs from the England Test Framework and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, hard to analyze for me as his master coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I have said this before - players are their own best pickers.
Long ago, you would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control over his own fate.
If he hopefully issues further runs for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The English coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not do so well, and that does not surprise me; he is a team-man in particular.
The question of how much time a test slagman gets to put his signs is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only suggestion that can be raised was that England first set up Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a hit man I appreciate very much.
He is an X-factor cricket player, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he reached 236 against us in a Trent Bridge place, which hit us very much.
He must have at least the same opportunities as he had before him, but of course this depends on the team formation in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moeen beat next to Cook, which would bring an extra spin-bowler and get four quicks, blew up, and I didn't have anything to do with it.
I don't see why a hit man can't hit there, and this left hand has already shown that he's a hell of a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He got three hundred runs right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the box as a back-up spinner, and in my limited treatment with him, he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at their statistics - on average 31 with the ball and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are no large numbers of backup spinners who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for young people.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman of Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a lot of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and how Mahela has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is consistent with the previous sentence.
Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Days, Root got a similar break against Australia and I don't have a problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team designers do not determine the timetable.
And you have to think that, like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made by light hearts.
The Brexit warehouse (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could win in Zulup if the economy runs in a river until 2017
David Cameron's tireless new negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is becoming more difficult every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is deeply ingrained because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, as deep in various crises as the EU is now and not always because of their own debt, are set up by Britain itself with broken consents and disturbing treaty changes that they do not want most.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if they were in danger of social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win alliances for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a British-looking outside the EU target - "Let's not be alone with France," says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have arrived in some major cities to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's carefully-founded Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office, before it looks bad for her, as it has happened with the exaggerated long-lasting ones such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is looking at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a bluffing force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain may be left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will be stretched out a leg to help the Selfie-Britten, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's withdrawal from the UK - something they don't want, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, perhaps some such ministers plan not even deliberately helpful remarks, in the SNP style, while Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a plea" and "United Kingdom has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how the Fleet Street can be stolen at their expense and what the EU-sceptics are the Oligarchy of the press barone, as they were not, during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can remember Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro opportunists, who made a name as an "EU-Grade banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of Tax-fearing Squirches, Telephone-Hacking Aliens and the Pseudo Non-Interns, who own most of our big newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similar about them, but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you distribute better bananas to get rid of it, instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blairian than Blair himself, when he opposed Cameron's referendum, because Blair had laid down the principle of the unadopted EU Constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never did that to him either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needs time to waste on me - seems at risk to repeat Neil Kinnocks Boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 1980s, a mistake then and today.
It can take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I express it in a friendly way - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue-coloured trend and the wildest fields of Tory's Small-Englanderism, probably everyone can say yes to that.
It's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week when the roadfinder fought in him, not to say that Corby's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father tried to be unfair to his cabinet colleagues on TV, without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "under all circumstances" - Ben's statement - was not what McDonnell said, what JC told his colleagues and deputies after all the reports at her closing meeting on Monday.
Whatever the moving bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he has even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the battle of social media, a crime scene of Paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for self-esteem, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corby's fundamental multiplicity to EU membership - in line with its Benite Warehouse, its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents for which the nazisism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its multiplicity to the Nato - Tom Watson is rockfest convinced that JC does not start a campaign to get out - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of home for their bosses.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be meaningless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction in the cost of the Tory government in power, where I was reminded of something called the British Influence Security Forum at the beginning of Monday.
Experts criticise Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a State-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "baseline statement" last month and described it as a "extensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the burden of data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A reference in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinary wind base" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers wrote in BMJ and asked whether the claims "to build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expected that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people invited to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to bring their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose manager had previously received the British American Tobacco Medium (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding that he was supposed to receive from Philip Morris International after reports from the tobacco company.
The reasons for the selection of members of the board are not provided, but several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in the tobacco management of PHE.
The group's research work "is markedly," that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, no such links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes were too early to serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers".
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded to.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifetime smoker dies in his search.
All evidence indicates that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to this, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence is and what it is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die of a smoking-related disease each year, and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ per year.
Through the clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastAnders, former chief of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastAnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit-shows like Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for placing public-law programs that are probably seen by a smaller audience in hard-disputed windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasts such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried to contact the BBC for six years at Channel 4 in his time without success.
"I've had problems with the idea that BBC programmes are being commissioned or sent, which would also be clearly demonstrated by non-subsidized rivals," Johnson told the Upper House Communication Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the radio fee, which I don't think medium or long-term for a good idea, you should at least have its production on programs that don't do or order others.
They send The Voice in a first-class window because they want to reach the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that anyone else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program is funded, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastAnders is another, given to both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was responsible for hunting for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people working there and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts return to what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTagart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows like EastAnders should be sold.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programmes should "go to BBC4 where you can hardly measure the audience, but they fulfill their tasks, and they can argue if they go on their seeming missions to justify 4 billion £ radio charges, "Now, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen."
They put them in a time window in which no one would ever want to see them.
Johnson told the committee about the radio fee: "I ask you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from this.
Of course you all think, we all think you get a big value here for £150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for £150, ask me if that's right, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also said before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC check their Reithian mission "to inform, form and entertain".
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% of their radio production - and that it should be an example for public-law TV broadcasters in Australia and Canada to change this in "intellect, explain and entertain".
On the question of the partnerships Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful of people are shown on TV, and enter alliances with the commercial channels to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment they are hit with sound pulses.
Scientists have raised worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The small nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are attacked with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard.
The impulses work by activating motoreuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Further on this topic: Researchers read and write hiertivity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new process, called sonogenetics, when ultrasonics can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that provides an electrical impulse in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fadenwarmers usually do not react to ultrasonic noise, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthen the ultrasonic waves that then enter the worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP-4-ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves affect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, such a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of its motor neurons carry TRP-4-ion channels.
When applying ultrasonic signal to the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microbulbs and transferred to the worms where they include the modified motor neurons.
The process has some similarities with optics, a cutting-edge tool that allows the scientist to switch on and off neurons with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light, which must be sent to the desired place in the brain at an optical fiber, low frequency ultrasonic tissue may pass unimpeded and thus can be sent to the brain from above on the shoulder.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right in front of your door!
The adverts shame the United Kingdom arms trade
See Amnesty International Anti-Waffen fair video.
Terrible killer drones!
Leg joint smearing legs!
Struubumben!
And electroshock rods that cause painful pain, but do not leave any trace!
The happy voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this display for the world's largest gun fair is a battle parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the British government's readiness to bring to light the ramps of weapons on repressive regimes about the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stops and in the subway trains and require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive from September 15th to 18th with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the London Underground fonts and the DLR line marks that turn into a picture of a panzer.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will drive with the DLR ... Customers will be asked to help with the stop of the gun fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have shown their work in the museum for gruesome designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £ package of in-bus keys, which claims that "access to around a third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will be more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists in protest movements and note that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another one of the anti-arms trading venues welcomes the pendler in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, who works with the graphic and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Liver was amazed at the silence that ruled around advertising for the gun fair - through an empty site of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic multi-stakeholder company, but "by investing in bright colors and animation it remains more binding."
"They have done a fantastic job helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an entry of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not unlawfully dealt with at our door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the gun fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors make fantastic euphemistic products worse.

This includes a "uniquely shaped fighting head that delivers outstanding effects within the target."

Eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Housing
Eleven years ago, as a self-repentant 19-year-old, I moved to a student's home, still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those I've been angry with - and the numerous long-standing complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance to the student residence is quite scary from slightly nervous to absolutely scary.
It's tempting to hide: tell people where you come from, whether or not you've taken a Saturday year, where you're talking about Corbyn and why you're saying "Marmite doesn't love or hate because in fact, boys, it's just a HAHAHA hefe extract, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It links the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your fire extinguishers were driving in fire and these fire extinguishers would be.
Let people go.
People's rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie night venues and municipal meeting places, but they are also the places where people are attracted to and justified by their underwear.
To this end: Do not think about starting with a relationship at the Uni
Introverted people receive severe treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many students' homes form a space-to-space cotton culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This may be the hell for someone who tries to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away, so that I can get back the energy I've spent on the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a comiliton of sociality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead.
Approach: Do it.
A guy in my student residence had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship through bakken.
As you begin the Uni at the height of the Back Manie, the knock on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of Brownies is less strange than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have baked you something. So, and now I smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade candy is a good way to make friends.
Your fellow citizens feel compelled to entertain themselves and may eventually associate your face with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you're a decent baker.
Bad mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you hit.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, swallowing chickens is a theft, but is taking a drop of milk for your tea as well?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my companion, who added a drug to her milk to punish the thief.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a noise that keeps people from sleeping or from work.
It is not only to be a decent person, but to be among the people who sit in the glasshouse in the true sense of the word.
A girl on my floor asked her neighbors if it would be possible for them to put something quieter in Drum & Bass, for it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When she finally stopped at 5:00, she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before she gave up her own music, closed her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future mate accidentally moved into the same student's home?
On the other hand, it would not be extremely painful if you were to hold a companion for your future mate, to date her, to separate herself, and then to see her every day, and perhaps to live with her, how she moves all of her friends to herself?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a warm companion is definitely not your future mate, at least try to convey a little sense to your inferiority.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his key in his unclosed room, the border between a wolf and a mobbing is as fine as it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it only takes moments until it gets to the boomerang.
By hiding, give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never waste any room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock her door, and place her keys in a glass of water that you then put in the freezer - but thank you for your properties on the deck no more than twice.
Series houses for refugees, self-employed, low-cost workers
The real estate company Markus Gildner builds in the medium-sized corner houses for people who do not have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the only raising mother and the minors."
"I show how you can still build cheap and well today," says 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly to create cheap living space: he builds in a project series houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be forced into the housing market.
Which solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or tournaments has no sustainability.
Because people stay a big part here.
In view of the refugee flow, we also need sufficient living space in the next decades.
A very banal, three-storey row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs at least a seat.
It facilitates integration.
It's different when you put people in housing blocks.
Each of the six houses built directly in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each of four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living area per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
That's obnoxious.
Six months has passed.
That's appropriate.
Did the construction regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I went through my project correctly.
Especially complicated, it always makes the threatening Damokles black special construction and the place regulation.
Terrible.
It is still subject to the need for at least three places to build three apartments in a row house.
Only in the cities there is no room for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their row house project?
Gildner: There were some of them who suggested that I create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
That's definitely not true.
But don't you enhance the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: It is true, however, that in the last five years we had a building tree in Germany, but luxury apartments were built that could hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need a living room.
Not only refugees, but also the only raising mother or the minor.
I'm showing you how to build up and build well today.
That's why we're here.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, typing to "General" and then selecting "software update".
If it's ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have been hit by problems after installation, as they receive an error message that tells you that the "software update failed" has failed.
In order to deal with the problem, users are advised to wait either until the storm returns or tries to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by shrinking the update. Also, it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then install them again once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is up to date or is in the vicinity of a charger, so that the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off half way and this could lead to a break in the update.

Rosberg's only currency: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows the WM title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton only a single currency: "Full Attack".
The WM second stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose anymore".
53 points separate the world's champion before the night break in Singapore on this Sunday of title defenders and double champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the 12 season races and also takes the Flutlicht Grand Prix in the city as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Brit was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city will have an influence on the high price of Singapore is still unclear.
For days a shower bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club, founded three months ago, "Schachfriend Bad Kissingen" has also joined another member in its series, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who took a course more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is a carrier of the 1st class and honorary of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that the president, Alfred Klein, defeated.
It is thus possible to include chess players who cannot afford the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent research should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-White" will be seen as an expression of its connection with the Kurstadt.
Quarter office looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Old Center Antonistift have joined the Mantel der Sozialstiftung and opened a new starting point at the Graf-Stauffenberg Square.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain into the center of town.
More precisely, the Count Stauffenberg Square.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and consultants will immediately receive information on issues such as care insurance or the services of the hospitals.
For years we have seen with our ambulance care service that caregivers are often left alone.
There are endlessly many questions.
"Neither are many of the services of the cashiers rarely taken into account, because the complexity of the insurance is not yet understood," explained the new Home Minister Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonist Foundation and the citizen hospital as well as for the ambulance service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
To this end, the saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as storm prevention, memory training or physical therapy can be used.
The offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis are complemented in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, care and reha.
"The Senior Care and Care Centre," Heike Riedel, director of Saludis, painted.
The reason for the opening of the new headquarters in the city centre is seen by both business leaders, especially in the demographic change.
Because this makes good decentralized infrastructure in the various parts of Bamberg in the future essential.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the dedication celebrations, the Quartiers ’ office also devoted itself to the association at the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite you to a regular social association".
Thus the Social Foundation made a big contribution to the ability of seniors to live as independently as possible and well as in their familiar environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o'clock, Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o'clock and Saturday from 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock.
Entracht Bamberg v. Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the appointment of Fuchsparkstadion for the game FC Entracht Bamberg against the third party of Würzburger Kickers has not yet been determined, the 6th of October has now been appointed as an appointment.
The meeting of the FC Entrracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian football Totopokals against the third party FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalized.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 7.00 p.m. in Bumberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is going over the stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the sale of cards now started.
It's something special for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore look forward to many spectators, and this is not without reason, because Flut light plays have a special time.
In the course of the last 16 teams, FC Entracht Bamberg 2010 won the district league 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and home against the regional leagues 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Association 2016/2017.
Title Defender is a third party SVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna Architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the artist's house reported on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the broadcast.
Born 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture during and after the Second World War at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he has worked as a liberating architect, but also as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Forming.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned with the establishment of the treasure chamber in Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz to the Austrian Theatre Museum.

The footballer was once, in the meantime Tim Wiese, ex-nationals in Germany and at Bremen and Hoppenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass, according to his own statement in the past two years.
However, he did not give up intellectually.
Wiese was allowed to cut his hair in the Bremer Inn town when he saw a parking guard outside exhibiting a criminal record for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the store, harassed the officer and threw the fines off her feet, as the "image" section reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the predictions, but is not yet clear about the consequences of the unusual event.
"The thing is still in the test," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that will decide whether or not to show grass.
Authorities of Panama destroy 4500 Marihuana plants
The fertile soil and the rain forest-like climate of Isla del Rey are best suited for the cultivation of Marihuana plants.
For three days, the Panamanian authorities have torn out the 4,500 plants and burned them.
Men spread to 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for an event in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 23.45 a.m., three young men were on their way from Bad Soden to Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghane, followed his two friends in a distance of about five meters, according to the police, and asked them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft tank.
There were also three persons standing on the site of the tank.
One of these men now screamed at the young man and struck him in the face with the fist.
The victim suffered a nose fracture and was bleeding out of the nose.
When his two friends flocked out and sat down to the battle, he first let go of his victim.
His friends brought the injured young man home now.
The actor followed the group with a pkw up to their apartment and went through there demonstrably multiple times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the fighter and another male person.
With the aid of a stroke, the victim's face and neck were struck.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical purposes.
So far, there's only a vague description of the killer.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second battle was supposed to be about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and notifiers to register under phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euros
Silvia Müller-Gongol and Frank Müller (left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
This is also welcomed by Mayor Bernd Bormann, Minister of Economic Affairs Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs Mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country, there are no doctors - Asenddorf, however, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is in rest, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, is still on the side of his successor in the coming months.
After a refurbishment phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises at St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was at first sight when the Rockehausen Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongol, met the Rockehausen, who is currently performing their specialist training in the World Hospital and wants to join the practice in the coming year.
"We always had in the back of our head that the müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was so, I just called her."
The couple Müller felt the idea of doing their own practice in Asenddorf in the future.
"The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
As an advantage, he also sees himself as soon as his own boss.
And so you agreed that the millers bought the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, the father of two families Frank Müller has also grown up, his medical study in Hannover followed in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sullingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as an supervisor in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as the leading notartz in Diepholz County and is a member of the DRC's Brechhausen-Vilsen team.
From September 19th, the practice is being prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his Gattin Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both Internistians, want to leave home as doctors.
"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongol.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic investigations as well as long-term and load EKGs and need a more speaking room.
In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.
A total of EUR 50000 is awarded to the millers under a programme of funding from the rural district (EUR 25000) as well as from the municipality (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being carried on," stressed Samtgegebührer Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongol, approximately 2000 patients come to the Valtehausen practice every quarter, in which the Northern German average practice is about 500.
There's another home doctor practice in Asenddorf.
A positive side effect of the practice acquisition by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the apothecary remains in Asenddorf.
If no successor had been found, they would have gone too.
Those who visit Müller's interview hours also continue to look in private faces: they take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rock houses.
With its separation ends in Asenddorf an era, however, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms," remembers Ursel Felstehausen shimmeringly.
A little bit of wetness she's been chasing after a long time.
"But we are still living in Hohenmoor and many patients will probably still be seen," says the Internistist.
Your husband laughs: "We have a 6000 square metre base."
"Bisher I always pushed myself before gardening, now it could be different."
The couple also has two singles and enjoys travelling.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now the border controls are also going high at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The checks at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also make this "self-evidently".
The supply and security of people are at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," the Minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, nor across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled procedure.
Croatia Considers Corridor - Slovenia Refuses
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow incoming refugees to travel towards Austria and Germany and, under circumstances, to establish corridors for refugees.
However, this did not see the Minister of the Interior Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will, rather, intensify border monitoring - especially in Hungary.
However, the border with Croatia has already been heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to limit its borders to refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government reported, the first refugees had already tried to travel through the Tovarnik/Sid border in eastern Croatia in the evening hours to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to intervene in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been in contact with the Croatian factory ever since.
It is primarily about Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country is counting on about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade argues that it is it that people should be instructed to take certain routes: "We can, we still want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, in the early morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The stakeholders have been travelling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometres away.
"We have heard that Hungary has joined, so the police told us we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could, in fact, result in the already predicted shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Hungarian-Hungary to a slightly further westerly route.
Croatia: Comprehensive possibilities for border control
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptions in the event of a strong flow of refugees.
Details he did not call, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member has "extensive possibilities for border control".
Strict checks are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Since 2007, Slovenia has been a member of the EU partners since then, as far as border controls are concerned, a good witness has been given to the country.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain fully closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down in the middle of the afternoon at a local sight in Horgos: he held the debate on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, too early.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Help advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps on which alternative routes are signed by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: in parts of the border area, there are still unscrupulous mining fields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners in the border region had been sent.
Exchange hacker: Ukraine pays 30 million dollars
Supranok is supposed to have been a ring of cybercriminals, which has been proposed to have gained insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwire and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information used should have included insider business on the financial markets.
In this way, the total amount of over $100 million was recovered from the investigators.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country borders will be finally captured," says the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 other defendants took place in the case.
Most of the accused came from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted both in the US and in Eastern Europe.
Economic hospice aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz reigns in business.
People perform their concerns, partly quick steps, partly cozy.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim car salon at the parade site.
Keep the city track.
Pulsating, rewarding life with a wonderful autumn sun and in the middle of four large tables each with the title "Before I want to die"....
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospital Assistance paid attention to its 20-year-old existence and is clearly confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lamber.
The Head of Ecumenical Hospital Assistance is also available to the passengers for questions and conversations as well as to the honorary staff.
While some spontaneous passersby grabs at the cricket and the sentence to "crowd my life", "read", "run by the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "do not suffer long", others stay short, read, say sentences like "as far as I am not yet" and then go on.
On the other hand, small discussions on the action on itself, on life, on how to deal with death continue.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I make it clear to myself that at some point the end of this world is coming to me, I can live with responsibility," says the director of the Mennheim Diaconian Works, who is together with the Caritas Association bearer of the Ecumenical Hospital Assistance.
Therefore, this public action should be good for the 20th year.
However, if not everyone wants to make themselves public on the tables, it is a very personal matter.
The topic of death and death is still gripped with tobacco, so the experience of Josefine Lamber, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening up of people.
An assessment by Angelika Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the honorary employees of the first hour.
Faced with the subject of personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the aid of death.
When the Ecumenical Hospital Assistance was sought by officials, it was immediately reported and was at the time of the establishment in 1995.
Godfroid is a team of 45 honorary officials - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the affected and members of private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and in the hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They're all trained carefully.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences involved.
"I see the life of another wait, hold it precious and treasure the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulance Ecumenical Hospital Service is free of charge and free of charge.
The financial support of hospitals and donations of members and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of death and mourning attendants.
Every two years, training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be listed on postcards.
FedEx mixed result, financial prospects for 2016 decreased
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced its profit outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said that it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time, FedEx announced last year that the company wanted to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in the pre-market trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cent less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected a survey of FactSet $10.84.
The lower prospect comes despite the price increases of on average 4.9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher subsidies for land transport of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November.
The company said, however, that it expected the result to increase over the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Charman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "makes solid profits when considering the weaker economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the rival UPS, which plans to set up 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, such as the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which twelve analysts asked for.
Sales increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks interviewed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has reported a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which led to a stagnation of sales in its unit.
But the tree in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport sales increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the pre-market trade, about an hour before opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday it closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a recorddoch on 11 June.
At its most anticipated meeting in the year, the Federal Reserve Strategen spends two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to lift the ladder for the first time for almost a decade.
Threatening them at the end of the depleted two-story sitting room, there is a wall image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that F-president Janet L. Yelle and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation ahead of all other things.
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from the Congress: maximizing US employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be exempted from the unprecedented incentive by the short-term interest rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most economic data show that they are growing solid, the latest turbulence in global financial markets could scare the already prudent Fed representatives to reinforce this volatility by raising the interest on federal bonds - and it is also only a quarter of a percentage.
"Indeed, the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they're watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the Makler company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think, if they were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which will insure the financial market itself.
About half of the economies that were recently questioned by Bloomberg have predicted a rise in interest this week.
However, the financial markets are expected to wait for the Fed, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market, if the feed increases the set, it is that the stratifiers will pardon the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy maintains the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the sentences at this time," he said.
If she does, "she had to go very far in her statement to calm down the financial markets so that they wouldn't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the fed will act.
One month ago, the fed seemed to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow strengthening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of rest in the USA.
In the spring and early summer, Yelle had said that in spite of the complaints from Liberals that more economic progress would be necessary, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although the creation of jobs slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level seen by the fed as full employment.
Increases in wages have shown signs of rest.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can manage higher interest rates and needs them because of the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets all over the world came together at the end of the last month, after China had lost its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would dampen global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, with the dow now being almost 10% below the peak of May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation when the interest is to be increased.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weaknesses of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have been drawn to this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US Note Bank.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better in the grip.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the fed, so it should not be technically involved in its finding.
But in the end, the Fed has become the currency authority of the world.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "enlarge" its monetary expansion, resolved confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, the Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global asset management strategy of Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, observed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacts on financial market movements that are apparently not related to economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who used to raise interest, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its lead by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "in spite of limited recognition of the impact on growth in the USA," said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives withdrew these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a serious crisis such as the collapse of the market in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest-fixing committee.
The latest turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest because the markets are excited," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that it should advance the time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market/store is a central starting point and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need motor oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes about an hour to slide through the walk.
If the whole shopping is hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garage (good and priced) in this shop is close to the boxes and has different reception options.
What is there here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C's probably got it.
Products are priced and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat tea is extensive, as well as the fish tea - the staff behind the tea will clean and fillate the fish and even break on request for you.
A good part of the shop is part of the massive cooling department. Here you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and gall, pig natural guts, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys in here: restaurant owners and kitchens, including individual families and individuals.
The wide ranges are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the box.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and the city centre - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not hard to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small Life Help for Refugees
More and more refugees come to Germany these days.
To prepare you a warm welcome, does not go without the commitment of countless noble helpers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support useless asylum seekers in the city.
They belong to Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
With her 74 lenses, she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum competition house at the Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from a real school.
Brazil's Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy lifestyles
The Brazilian Paediatric Organization SPRS tries to find out in a shocking way how important good food is during the time of silence. It does this with the presentation of images of babies who suck on breasts that are painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers will be able to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results indicate that higher calorie consumption is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A current study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions to the new Bernrier Sporthalle
The municipality of Bernried approved the application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sporthalle.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be smoother for solar system.
The plans for the long-standing construction of tournaments at the Bernreid sports grounds are taking place step by step: at the recent municipal meeting, the project was unanimously approved without much discussion.
The Board had previously decided, among other things, to apply for a "exemption" or "exemption" from the applicable construction plan.
The "exclusion" was the permit for a special form of roof construction.
Thus, a "satisfaction with non-middle first and top top" is to be created.
On the basis of the planning, the intended use of the roof area for solar systems is: "This brings us together a wonderfully large southern," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In the case of the "freedom" the roof was to lie below 10 degrees for energy reasons, other than in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "freedom" was therefore necessary because the construction plan for the roofing does not allow "emissions" - while Bernries' community council is generally more restrictive in the case of relief applications.
However, the construction of the tournament is not a recurring project: "We do not create a presidential fall," says Steigenberger.
The tournament building at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and of the SV Bernried.
At the cost of about 2.3 million euros are calculated.
Grants are expected from the promotion of school and broadband.
In the next step, the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will now be submitted to the Land Council for examination.
Pißenberg clinic leads to Schongau
The Pißenberg Hospital is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - that is 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of employees move from Pißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the hospital house GmbH of the county district confirmed by the Landrätt Andrea Jochner-White.
However, a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Board, and it will take place on Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in Pißenberg would continue to work.
The majority are to move to Schongau with fishermen and the remaining internal station.
The rooms are available.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, as Jochner-White.
The staff are informed of the plans.
The change has resulted in the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been the medical director of Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice near the hospital.
On the question of who should follow up, according to Jochner-White, the name "Fischer" came into the game, which was ready to take the lead from October 1st, and to move with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case a "revaluation" and an extension of the offer in the area of "Internal Medicine", according to Jochner-White.
Fisher is a specialist for heartmakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the interior station.
For the next two years, Fischer and his team will, if the Supervisory Board agrees, lead both houses until the next year, the former hospital of the Battalion, which still has 35 beds, will be finally closed in Pittenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county has planned this for 2018 when the current recovery at Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Landrätin Jochner-Witt, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, opposed the announcement that the house, which is in possession of the federal deficit, should be used in the future as accommodation for asylum-seekers.
"That's what I'm saying." As it goes on with the property, Jochner-Knowt could not say there are several considerations.
At present, there is a short-term care for caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What better thing could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come back," says Fischer about the curing of Quasi to the corpse that was recorded by the employees "positive and very understandable".
There has been no real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief for more than 30 years.
He had been asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the position of the Director of Medicine.
The Pißenberg Hospital (one hundred beds) has been threatened again and again in the past decades, departments have been closed, such as surgery and birth care.
The handballs of the Rhine-Neckar Löwen are required at the HC at night (20.15 am).
The head of the Bundesliga is in Wuppertal, although the clear preference, but there is no cause for superiority.
In the last season, the bathers at BHC had a painful downfall and had some good smells there.
Hunting accident with two injured in Pratau
Two tractors were seriously injured during their maeser days on Tuesday afternoon by shots.
During the evening on a corn field near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg) several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a shot, a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals.
Just as it could have happened, it was not clear at first.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rheinland-Pfalz Victims of Violence
A suspect has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds who have been missing since Saturday from Rheinland-Pfalz.
In the hearing, the 20-year-old added that the young people were killed and had to throw their bodies into a channel in rock houses.
Since Saturday, 16-year-olds from Rheinland-Pfalz have been killed by violence.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday in Rockenhausen at Kaiserslautern, as state attorney and police reported on Wednesday.
As a suspect, a 20-year-old arrested on Tuesday is also considered to be a suspect, who was in line with the fact and led the investigator to the founding site of the body.
The 16-year-old was missed on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed upon after a visit to a autumn party in Rockenhausen.
When looking for the young woman, the investigators first focused on personal objects of the victim.
In the case of interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, a suspicion was finally expressed against the 20-year-olds.
The obstetrician then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen where the body was found.
According to the police investigation, the arrester added that the 16-year-olds were killed and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the court-martial on Wednesday, who will be charged with murder.
A review of the circumstances of the case should lead to further investigations.
Refugees Need Accommodations: Study warns against apartment accidents
The situation on the German apartment market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for a payable stay.
The pressure on the apartment market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have started for the longest time.
With the incoming EU refugees and job seekers, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with poor citizens for the last affordable apartments.
In order to cover the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units had to be built each year by 2020.
This results in a study on behalf of the Association of Social Housing.
For comparison: This year 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
That's why 140,000 homes are missing.
Refugees are no longer obliged to live in an asylum-seeker after the first three months of their stay.
Many then enter the apartment market and enter the long hoses in front of the apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for the last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not limited to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study has also made significant losses in housing policy over the last few years.
Germany faces a housing deficit that is growing from year to year.
Currently, about 770,000 housing units were missing in the dance areas, complained Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities forced into WG rooms.
Young adults remained unwilling to stay in the "Hotel Mama" because of the fluctuations in the apartment market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per head has been reduced for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the Alliance of Social Housing proposes a new start.
New incentives should be reinvigorated in social housing.
In this way, the basic taxes could be waived and the basic taxes imposed on funded apartments would be suspended.
Moreover, according to the Alliance, attractive tax options are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation at the KfW State Bank is already well under way in cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start of the Monday evening, more than half of the 300 million euros available have already been collected with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be suspended.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up Corridor
According to Hungary, there is virtually no more passage, as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant the journey through Slovenia to the north without any threats.
But the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to understand with the neighbouring Slovenia the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the removal of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have been displaced to Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV broadcaster RTL.
Hungary had cut off its border on refugees in the morning.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make orderly asylum procedures virtually redundant in Hungary.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had attacked Croatia's first refugees at the border of Serbia in the morning.
Most media reports are from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border city Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not cross the border.
The border zones pose other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mine-spacers should now create a safe passage quickly.
After the border is closed to Hungary, there are hardly more refugees.
On Tuesday, the police took 366 people.
Shortly before the close of Monday, there were 9380.
The new Hungarian laws condemn the overcoming and damaging of the border zone as a criminal offence.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern border city of Szeged.
The convicted are threatened with imprisonment for up to five years and the removal from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" on the border, of which almost all - 93 - were the most important transition from Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
In the middle of the morning, there were still 40 refugees.
In practice, however, no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The refused asylum-seekers are to be moved there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the garbage, leaving tens of thousands of people on the road in the past weeks.
Sperrgitter was demolished and one of the recording camps in the border area was rebuilt.
No one wanted to speak for the purpose of this refurbishment.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the border between Serbia and Hungary is closed.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, according to government data, some 20,000 migrants remained in the country.
In Salzburg, some 1,400 people are waiting for the move to Germany.
The transport from there to Germany was stopped on the morning of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees met regularly.
Mayor "Gestrandette" drove across the border
"We were busy cleaning after the bridge party on Sunday, when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Because on Sunday, however, because of the fluctuation, Germany had surprised the train traffic with Austria, it was in Wernstein's conclusion," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the beachmen along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the nearby Passau.
Before that, we ate the unexpected guests, with juice and drinks.
We just said we'd bring them by car to Passau.
"That was of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN discussion.
They were very grateful.
A man couldn't afford to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the firefight.
"We are very pleased about that," said Stadler.
On Sunday evening, the beached train passengers moved from an ICE to a regional train to Passau to try to cross the border, but after the short-term announcement that the traffic was stopped to Germany.
However, the regional train was postponed in front of the border in Wernstein at the Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge party is in association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, days before a two bridge race - organized by the Union of Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending us more tens of thousands of visas is a logical result of a clear policy:
Instead of helping immediately with the establishment of structures to ensure humanity in the Röszke camp, our Federal Chancellor has put the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dunstkreis of National Socialism.
The leaders of this policy are not only the Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the "loved country", which they have invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
There will be a great challenge in view of the continuing flows of refugees and the approaching winter, to create decent conditions for protection seekers in our presence.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter holidays
Konrad has all his hands full with the escape.
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to build quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center of Traiskirchen has already reached Konrad.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday was also without a big spin, Konrad said and praised the organizational "mastership".
On the other hand, the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a "critical situation".
In total, Konrad has a need for 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 more accommodation will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries, 15,000 of the feds.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a phase without ground," said Konrad.
He has already held talks with the chief of state.
They would have assured him that they would also create neighbourhoods for the future refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandater supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, explaining how the church will help.
Large expectations also put the asylum coordinator in the ORF action "Help as we do".
On the platform, private individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier criticised yesterday the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it may not be possible for the quartiers to keep a certain height of the hand-held or the size of the upper lights.
For a limited time, "not standards" should apply.
The fact that he was more successful than the Ministry of the Interior when he was in accommodation is based on Konrad's experience.
I am an older lord, one who is not told the truth without any further face.
Convinced power is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cost the Republic as they themselves explained.
Their number of employees wants to increase to three to four.
The search for their own quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are obviously problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better distribution
First, there is no opening of urban sports and other buildings such as Tip Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees, the city of Linz plans.
This is not necessary at the moment, as it is now possible to stop the people concerned without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, further locations should be checked for the emergency.
Criticism is practiced by the head of the city in the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other areas must contribute here as well.
Seehofer: "limits are not cut off"
In a longer phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday to continue the process in the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be abolished.
The further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic was still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
Special services with refugees to Germany will not be available any more.
However, protection seekers would be brought with regular trains to Germany.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer once again called for enhanced solidarity in the issue of refugees.
Now that Austria is re-introducing controls at its borders, Pühringer is "a logical consequence" from the German process.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The generalization of the "new yard" in the Linzer industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T is hired, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT are the smart heads of our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies in the new company and then acquiring any.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - some of which Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros have been invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the techcenter, which is one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the federal (FFG).
The building is contaminated by the Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remains in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second business in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to raise a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to put up with this project in the Taubenmarkt Arkada shorthand: she has now been raised in the form of another business venue.
In the Furla shop opposite the store where they sell bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from different manufacturers, everything is now turning around to have women's handbags at the Furla brand, money exchanges are from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop is in operation.
It was rebuilt several weeks earlier.
"But I've been wondering for a long time if I should open another charge," says Breit.
The decision was that, among other things, the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of their own place where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the large area of Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has got width from her mother into the scales.
I get the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why can't the expert answer with the latest certainty when looking at a nice handbag?
Maybe it's because a nice bag evaluates every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Callstadt
The Pälzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place called the inhabitants.
This property is also linked to the billionaire who wants to become president of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for fans.
Whether he's a stranger, he's a journalist, or he's a misconception in international crisis policy, the candidate for the US President's office is making a strong election.
And cut off well.
This is also recorded in the Pfälse Callstadt, where the grandparents of the real billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the Féhnfrissur is a term for many in the wine village on the wine road.
Some in the 1200-occupational location are over -twenty corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the election mode.
The cold city woman Simone Wendel filmed a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think those who find it kind of exciting, but are also not so deeply impressed in their call city style," says Simone Wendel.
The native cold town has filmed a funny documentary about the place and its famous spruces, including the Ketchup family Heinz, in addition to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, comes to "Kings of Kalllstadt" (2014) as well - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kalllstadt.
He didn't bring it there to the king of hearts.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, it tends to be the opinion that Trump is "a little bit of a big mouth," says Wendel.
Randomly, the name of the town of Callal is said to be "The Brulljesmacher" - in German: the teller, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the donors.
The Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later Grandfather expanded and opened a site for gold miners in the United States.
The foundation of the real estate group was the first real estate buyers in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: your desire to return to the home for a long time broke down in the Bavarian state, to which the people belonged at the time.
He didn't record Trump because he was out of his mind once without permission, the director of the Institute for Pälse History and Nationalism, Roland Paul, had declared the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrator".
This contrasts with the underlying marked statements of the offspring.
He had repeatedly spoken apostately about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to scare illegal immigrants.
"As the pultered, it's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative Trump ("The grandmother was a born trumpet, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The winner at rest sees the American rather distant, "he's always so exciting".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Call City."
The pension manager Veronika Schramm mentions, like some of the cold cities, that a descendant of the Heinz family at a visit gave something to the church organ, which generally came well.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says 68-year-olds.
She found it better if he didn't win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who had the matter at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "where he never got there".
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzer daughter Sarah Bühler.
What about as president?
"My president isn't," she says.
And, "The grapes will also be ripe without President Trump."
Wendels Film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 filmmakers, also in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
At the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabited village of Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "Gergsteiger villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have up to 2,500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be identified as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite Nina's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at today's show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson moved to Canberra to report the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but there have been no major shifts in the evaluations for today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the Bundeshauptstadt, when Malcolm Turnbull created Tony Abbott's storm.
The rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a weekly series of international television broadcasts in London, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved an average of 397.000 spectators in the five main cities, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap on Sunrise in the last few months.
Today, on average, 318,000 reached the 330,000 of Sunrise in August.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise stands at an average of 349,000 spectators to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The wind of change concerns these people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for checking!

The great novelty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star from Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently-white father who decides to leave with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit show Solo without the rappers Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday's evening answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million spectators and slightly beat The Block (838.000) and TBL families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results at night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5.30 p.m.) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe on average 446.000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 till 18:00) ran to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour it sat 720,000.
Hot seat on average 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will be most likely to agree that the hot-satet will finally be held at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn't make it to fly the McGueres show.

The last three votes agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Enlightenment of Secret? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have incredibly obvious who wins The Bachelor.
The woman who finally landed Sam Wood in The Bachelor was kept secret.
And not one of the three remaining girls will certainly be rewarded if she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before becoming out of two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women were lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor, pride, family values and positive attitude as a reason why they wanted to be his partner.
However, when the question is asked "If you don't, who should get Woods' last rose?", their answers to the game destroyer, who won the hearts of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski called both fast - except for themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went to the house and (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought about it all over the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands on the ground with both feet, it makes so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they've got the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week the house visit made it clear that Wood could be one.
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now completely on him," she said.
And when she was asked, who would choose Wood if she wasn't, she was ridiculous.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the rest of the girls alike - it's an inconsistencies between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches would have banned Hayne from the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a band like the Aussie-Rugby-Liga conversion at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula confided to his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return to a score and also to the current game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of smacking his smokes before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49th sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who encouraged him to forget his captured catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point that was restored in the first game district of Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the beginning, the Hayne and his massive Australian succession for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field soon after the Fumble and later told Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1, that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his origin Debüt in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a trial for Queensland.
All in all, it was a great experience for the 27-year-olds.
Hayne posted for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the slums
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested in a Siberian field with weapons.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company accused Yukos and suspended his democratic efforts.
The free voters call for the establishment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high numbers of refugees.
Head of Party and Group Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW Erbstklur in Großwallstadt against a severe crisis in Bayern's schools, if there are no new teachers for many new students, "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapsing," said Aiwanger.
"Unfortunately, we will receive recruitments in the Bavarian education system."
The rural part of the Free Elections will take place in the underground municipality until Friday.
In fact, some other key topics were envisaged.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the free electoral meeting.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will overcome the Klausur," said Aywanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it did during the Yugoslavian war in the nineties.
"That's not the way it goes, we have to deal with the causes," said the Free Voter Chief.
Declined asylum seekers want to remove the free voters as quickly as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum courts," said Aiwanger.
The FW Chief criticised that several federal countries were not consistent: "We need federal uniform standards."
"Byern's pulling off, not the others."
"We need to be more capable of action."
But the state policy in Großwallstadt is not to fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
In the new school year, Culture Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 Gymnasia launched the pilot test "Middle Plus" in which an extension of the secondary level is tested from three to four years - the result then takes nine years to the Abitor.
But that's not enough for Aiwanger.
"The G9 theme needs to be accelerated," said the FW Chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all gymnasiums who want to do so.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Fester Wall Street helps Dax to jump
The German stock market has closed down a wide range of directionless and nervous trade with profits.
Only in the afternoon was a firmer rise in US stock exchanges for a clear direction that eventually moved the Dax by 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points above.
The MDax averaged value won 0.54 percent at 19,552,88 points.
The technologically flexible TecDax increased by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50 as the Eurozone's lead index averaged 1.01 per cent to 3207.60 points.
Solid wins also booked the trading venues in London and Paris.
In the United States, the Dow-Jones index last noted about 1 percent in the plus.
Many Borsians expect markets to take place on this Friday until after the US interest rate has been decided, as well as for the large fall in the deadlines.
The debate on the loads from the nuclear power plant has, at the same time, pushed RWE’s shares to a record level and left deep traces at Eon.
According to "Spegel", German energy groups may be missing 30 billion euros in savings.
The Federal Government dismissed the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy groups recovered slightly, but ultimately lost 3.31 per cent (RWE) and 6.15 per cent (Eon).
Infineon shares increased at the Dax point by another 3.22 percent.
According to a dealer, a positive report from the US depositary magazine "Barron's" came after the weekend.
Thus, investors gave too little attention to the German Chipbauer at the moment.
Investments in future wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid.
Car values were asked: Even in the traditional weak summer month of August, more cars were replaced than in the previous year, as the Acea Industry Association announced at the beginning of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of the autobuilder Daimler and BMW added by 1.34 per cent or 2.21 per cent.
Volkswagen's advance was 1.26 percent.
In the German interest rate market, the turnover of listed Federal securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) per cent.

The Federal Future lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
The euro's price fell to $1,1262 in the afternoon.
The European Central Bank had set the reference rate at $1,1305 (1,1268) on Wednesday.
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) Euro.
4 people killed after police shooting rubber shots on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, an officer said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday in Rupandehi District, approximately 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Head of District Officers, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police used Trengengas and then shot into the air before she attacked rubber shots.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber shots used, of which it is known that they can kill, but which are traditionally used as less lethal alternatives, apparently produced such a high rate of death.
The dispute was the last week of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group said that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want a state of their own.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflicts since the 10th century.
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emmer Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square meter area.
A mix of trade, commerce and housing is planned - concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a large plot of approximately 4,000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Old Post youth centre.
Preparations are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, commerce and housing.
You wait for the corresponding offers, it's from the city.
Any investor's inquiry is not clear yet.
It is also true that the contracts have not yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had bought a part of the property located on the Ringstraße / Ecke Grandestraße, a few months ago, and had the building covered.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home at the Small Sea at Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Some of the investors are still concerned - they fear the sale of their holiday home
For months it had been negotiated, groped, debated and signed behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home at the Small Sea are close to Emden on the table.
The interested, the medium-term Ember company "System-Bau", presented its plans for the first time on Monday in the Council’s Urban Development Committee.
This item was originally on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critic and the FDP Group, who challenged the investors and the administration of the secret ceramics, Ralf Behrends went to the offensive from the system building management: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he told the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
It has been in the debate for about ten to twelve million euros.
The images and new details called for the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, the shipowner and board member in the representatives of the investors, Pro Hieve, complains: "This is a giant club that surpasses all other buildings".
He also fears, like several other project critics, that traffic would increase strongly by the intended size of the plant: "There must be all bus charges to make this count," says Schulz
However, what is happening on the very good hectar of the large area of the former guesthouse is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"We must have a key concept first," said Ralf Behrends.
Because of this lack, the construction plans are still variable.
Billings growth at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy to grow up with its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Diana brought twins to the world yesterday.
The birth of twins is rare in Gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is almost 50 years behind and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, called the Zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla wills has not yet been established, since Mother Diana has so far kept them close in the body.
At first, the "image" had been reported.
NHC predicts 60% chance for Cyclones south of Cape Verde
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center said a wide depth printing system of approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verden islands, which has a 60-percent chance of developing into a tropical vertebral storm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined depth pressure system, for example, in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60-percent potential to form a tropical vertebral storm in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations, to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations, as they flee from the war to end and to end poverty.
Google has an unusually personal approach to making the donation information available on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our trip included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The funds go to four non-profit organizations to provide help for refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugee relief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from the war - torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.
Report by Yasmeen Abutaleb; working by Christian Plumb
For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote a guide to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositional surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of the body to absorb food.
Over the years, adiposa operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill-fated with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered fat-like.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 comparing two types of adipositional surgery - stomach bypass and stomach tumor formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
In the meantime, BMI remained with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatment at approximately 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% of the patients had a complete and 28% resolution of diabetes.
In the medical-treated group, in comparison, diabetes was completely resolved only by one percent and partly by only about two percent.
In addition, the results of blood pressure controls, triglyceride and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were "in general better in the "surgical" group", the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, according to researchers.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, as led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrettomy group (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved higher reductions in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs 2.1%) and reported a complete excess of diabetes (46.9% vs 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more difficult people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study it was for fat-eating people undergoing an adiposa operation to die about 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the surgical patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a conversion is really difficult."
Love history plays in the back of the Huns
It is a topic that is currently growing in Belletristik: A young woman, unloved and indistinct at school, meets her youth's miseries after years, and she falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "In fact we're not like that" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the history of love, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author has grown up in Langweiler and is happy that she was able to place a literary monument to her home.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Budadist leader called for the end of violence in the refugee home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of its ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents in the circumstances.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis was remarkable, but the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama Germany and Austria praised efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To care for several thousand refugees, it is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long-term solutions, how a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we must consider how killing in their countries is reduced.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attack of 11 September and noted that the violent reaction of the United States attracted a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my resignation in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in vain.
"I know his motives were good, but he put on violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Repeat increase in the use of hand infection agents by children over the last 4 years
Drug control centres in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who have suffered severe alcoholic hand infection, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gailord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of the intake of hand infections in children under 12 years of age reported by poison control centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them go to emergency recording," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young disinfectants drink only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing mouth water to obtain a stronger drink.
Younger children can be angeled by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think it's bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapefruit and orange juice, which are very suitable for children.
Hand infection agents contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Dentistry Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, Sender Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't let a whisky blow out, but people let these hand disinfectants in the range of children, and when children come to it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaija Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four sprays of hand infection at school from post-earth beer, was taken into emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice as high as the threshold that is legally applicable to an adult as drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, a emergency admission doctor who treated her in the Winnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nahiah kept her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children’s hospital on signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through alcohol and had hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaija's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and to store hand infections outside the child's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with fatalities.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand infections that included a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials assume that the product contains methanol, a lethal solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which has been listed as an active substance.
In January, three of the fourth grade students in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by putting antibacterial products around the teaching area," a police report reported.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand infection and banned her from her room.
The police viewed the plan as a "sweet" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwingingen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been easily injured in an accident on the cross-breed between the Nordring and On Herden.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove across the crossroads towards the district of industrial traffic and took too late to realize that two leading vehicles had stopped in the circuit.
As a result, he drove his truck into the corner of an audis and drove this vehicle to a nearby Ford Fiesta.
In the case of unmanned vehicles, damage was caused by around EUR 10 000, the police report.
The 33-year-old audience was no longer ready to travel and had to be dragged away.
Kitchen: No Disharmonie at Celtic
Griffiths plays the string of harmony down at Celtic Glasgow, Deala adds that the Hopes are in a bad place, but that he will turn it again.
Hearts will fight SFA because of Neilson's indictment and Warburton will be careful about January's new obligations that could destroy the unit of the camp.
Dons increase lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half of the time gave Aberdeen a short victory over Hamilton in Pittofrie, so that the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays directly over harmony down
There are reports of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was deliberately rejected by Griffiths. This was because he and his team comrades are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch table guide.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football longevity Netherlands - de Boer
The former rangers middlefield player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic, since there is no title rivalry with the rangers.
De Boer, currently a ambassador for Ajax, said, "In Holland they no longer show the highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the rangers aren't there.
People here are not only talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the old firm games, and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Dela.
RONNY Deala has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn things around.
Following the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League, the defeat against the 10 men from Aberdeen, who now stand at the top of the table with five points ahead.
But Dela said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out as quickly as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way - but we have to move on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
It's so important to be together now.
Warburton Careful on January Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he indicated some January transfers, Ranger's boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new accesses and insists that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox Framework unit.
Brentford's ex-chief said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this preseason time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is arranged by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic-Zielperson Michu with rear registration
Swansea storm Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract expires at the Swans.
For two years, the 29-year-old has been hooked up with a lousy bone and has not made the withdrawal from Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA Battle set for Nelson comments
The hearts led 2:1, as Patterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the Defender was later lifted - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson continues what he has said, and continues: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The unparalleled hibee was justified after he admitted to singing a song with aggressive lyrics about Ex-Hearts Player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a Roseburn in Edinburgh in March 2014 in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer, adding: "It's safe to say that I'm not going back to Tynacastle if it's not for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has trust in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that the board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but that the downfall has to end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll get the boys back to work," said Donnelly.
McInne's happy to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes argues that his team from Aberdeen had to fight against Hamilton Accies in despair to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything in puzzle games or leagues that have not won this kind of game."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose from 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above that of the UK of 5.5 per cent, as shown by the figures of the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, the employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The long-term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Limitations disrupted the course
Since security personnel were unable to clear the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepperspray could the officials take the disruptors into custody.
An athemalchol test was performed at a 16-year-old, 0.89 promille.
The adult was taken by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and was first in custody.
Why am I going to be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a later legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear myself.
So, why would I do that?
I agreed, because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see locations in the United States, and since more applications are often available than places, a makeable lottery takes place to decide who is selected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will be watched without emotion.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossips, a close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephones and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants, and you will be given access.
I'm complaining about her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better", but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would.
I told him he could get me out of his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks the public work of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I have made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his orientation is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn.
What you get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man is surprised to come out of the Canning River after a wet police chase.
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry when he crossed the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the hot and suspense water, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "slowly persuade him to return to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale were called on Tuesday to a house break in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them in the direction of Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I won't come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to make his uniform wes, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "a good cop negotiated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Mastership football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the graves to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired by natives to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end the race sport
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his cities last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had carried out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's Late Scratching due to a Wednesday's treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he faced difficult conditions himself when it was about the positive cobalt topper test at Ledaris that he couldn't explain.
He had stayed for 18 months because of the espionage proposals and did not want it "to look like grapes hanging too high."
"I had nothing to say about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that it's all coming out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around the raised head, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
Then I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my seats to provide information about what I'm doing within my seats," Moody said at Racing.com.
You obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly stick to their noses because they refused to catch me when they tried to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, the official president of the RVL and Bernard Saudry, the current CEO of the RVL, were aware of it at the time and are still there today.
Should that make me think it's going to be personal?
Did the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps make people out of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and break me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying is now letting them think about it.
But I have come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and force them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration level of the coach has been built up with the long-lasting cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late Scratching led him to say that he could "put his license on the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeatable Master Black Caviar, called the racing day treatment rule "laughing", after a pack of mud or sound was placed on the horses' legs, which interfered with the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has mistakenly put a bad foot on his leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like yesterday all day, whatever it was.
But it was the same on Sunday.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the packaging on Wednesday. An investigation of this issue was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after a driver's flight
At the weekend, the police arrested a man after a collision with a biker and then a driver in Cobram.
The biker was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at Murray Valley Autobahn.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia, the police, arrived in Shepparton.
It is expected to be charged for driving and for lack of assistance and for other traffic offences.
The rider, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy fights rivals because of claims to ring fights
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players as "Agenda setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the divorce courts allowed the storm players "ringfighting" with his team during the high storm victory at the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly hidden remark to the storm team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening. He called the game a "pattern example" of Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team's tacks and said that they were focused only on their "contact" at the tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team was credible, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm team.
"It always turns out - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything to our defensive system or techniques all year round. But in the last six weeks, we've made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has brought us the trend.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing it, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It is already funny, as it always shows up at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennetts' idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawra Dragons won the 2010 Premier League with "long-term" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to our Friday night and how exciting her game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticised as a boring team, and Wayne said he'd take care of a piece of shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we view as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are pauses and no points exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in one phase.
The Storm team is free to receive on this weekend, as they have won the right, either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday evening at the AAMI Park.
Serbia with $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man who may be threatened by a lifelong penalty because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that were smuggled to Queensland was released against a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drugs on the yacht Solay, who came from South America over Vanuatu and set up in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his fellow prisoners at the yacht port during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible lifelong penalty for attempting to own a commercial quantity of cocaine, the lawyer of Maximovic argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the whole quantity and that it could have been in the café for a harmless reason.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of flight at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of crime, he denied the police about his place of residence.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had offered a bail of $200,000 as security together to reach his release.
"After reading the separate statements of the two parties, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Justice Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, subject to the conditions that he gives his Australian and Serbian passport, reported to the police daily and held at a starting stop from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: Guidehouse breaks apart
On Tuesday night, a truck driver was seriously injured on three trucks on the 5th motorway at Karlsruhe.
Two of the three involved trucks had braked in front of a permanent construction plant towards Basel.
The third driver noticed that it was too late and tried deliberately to escape at the last moment to the left, as the police reported.
The driver's house of the accident triggers completely apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for over six hours to 2 hours.
There was a damage of EUR 122,000.
Steven Hogg's phone used by girls to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when he slept, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a number of inappropriate images from children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping Hogg.
She watched it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed the computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used the terms for looking for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that he had done it because it would lead to "Pedophile on the Internet" and then he "destroyed to be a police officer to scare them".
State attorney Elidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a search - that he was sick to scare people.
He added that the searches were carried out on the computer by him, but he said it was because he claimed to be a cop to scare paedophile.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he was sick in his head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was at the cider and the wine.
She then also saw the inappropriate images on the phone and confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and Playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, guilty in the sense of the indictment, of having taken undue pictures of children on 14 June last year, of having violated the orders on 25 January of this year and not of having appeared before the court on 24 March of this year.
Defendant lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" was found in his past.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael removed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was granted bail, but because of hearings on other cases still pending, it was kept under investigation.
He was registered before the date of the judgment in the register of sexual offenders.
Schleusers vary on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being attacked at the German-Austrian border, apart from the major checkpoints.
Many lockers have allowed fear of discovery and arrest to increase people at smaller border crossings
on the Austrian side out, a spokesperson of the Federal Police said.
Along the river Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been attacked in the Passau and Rottal-Inn districts since Tuesday.
They were on foot on the German side of bridges and bridges.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to registration.
At the Munich Main Station, after federal police reports, more refugees again arrived on Wednesday, compared to the start of the week.
By 8:00 a.m., about 700 people arrived in the capital, a speaker said in the morning.
Following the re-introduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday, 1759 refugees reached the city.
Stuttgart: Tropensturm "Henry" runner expected in the south-west
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest of midnight.
The German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart, which is currently operating in a deep pressure area across Western Europe, has been able to provide hot sea air to the country.
The strong depth was the exit of the "Henry" tropical storm, which had been pulled over the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in the past days.
Strong storms and winds are expected mainly in Baden.
According to DWD, it is still to be calculated until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Schwäbische Alb and on the ground seekreis with curves of 60 to 90 kilometres.
So on Friday, the sun can be reappeared.
The mass makes it: Every two years the autobuilder on the IAA shows their news.
2015 is mainly to be recorded in the compact cars, which are currently sold particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly asked: Around 28.1 percent of the new permits were issued by the KBA alone in August on this segment.
This is also reflected in the IAA (Public Day 17-27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year in particular.
One of the biggest prizes for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be held in the autumn by the dealers.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new astra should not be much more expensive for it.
Opel represents an entry below the largest rival VW golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 Euros.
The Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
In addition, the lifts offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, which are also included for the first time.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, there is the Opel Astra first only as a five-star.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the van, which is already visible on the IAA.
And what's going to happen next to the Astra on the IAA to new compact cars?
Renault Megane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra-competitive Megane into the race.
At the fair, the Megane is only seen as a five-holer in a conventional and accentuated sporty GT version.
He comes to trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a van.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
The Nissan Abeger wants to find its position in the highly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti fits fully with its curved lines into the design line of the brand.
The base model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
In the offer there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: The new segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premieres in Frankfurt.
The model with petrol engines is offered, including a newly developed 1.0 litre turbo engine and a performance of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum torque is set at 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The sale of the Baleno in Europe is in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not quite new, but around it is the compact class model DS 4, which is to be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble citroën-abeleger especially hand on the front: Here the cooler grill was redesigned and the modified light bulbs equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernised, the number of buttons has been reduced by a touch screen, and Apples CarPlay has been integrated for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are listed in the IAA compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are humanly unworthy
The Federal Constitutional Court has given a former prisoner to the Tegel Judicial Office, which was held in a small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation when they are placed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the victims can even hope for money if they were confined to the narrow spaces for a few days (Ag.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This led to the success of a former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was placed in a single cell at the Berlin-Tegel judicial office between June and November 2009 with about five square meters of ground area; the toilet was not spaced apart.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer's statement, was now on a free footing again was placed in a larger cell.
His charges against the Land of Berlin were dismissed because of the undeservable conditions of imprisonment.
However, the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and re-examined the case there.
You see the human dignity of the man injured.
Court of Justice now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, the period in question was only a few days long enough for compensation, there was a claim for compensation.
Otherwise, it would be "an advocate of the protection of the person".
The Court of Justice must now clarify the amount of damages.
In the past, the constitutional courts have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they only spoke of a prisoner's injury because he was naked locked in a cell.
A 2011 decision on a multiple cell without a separate toilet is not worthy of human dignity.
In addition, Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The complainant was placed in a cell of the same type as in Karlsruher case every three months between 15 and 21 hours.
In the last few weeks, the Berlin prisons have also come to the battle lines because of missing personnel.
Prisoners are therefore constantly included for 23 hours, increasing aggressiveness, even in battles, because of the tense situation.
After the hearing of the press, 21 people in Tegel are not occupied due to a lack of maturity, 19 are due to disappear in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the Refugee Policy: "We create it"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What happens to Germany?
About 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice-Kanzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can create it, and we create it".
What happens in Germany is the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Tree Ministry) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - and the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as previously built (250000 apartments).
The lack of living space is dramatic, but especially in the case of affordable rental facilities: annually, 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price bond, and refugees will apply for these particularly favourable apartments.
Federal Ministry of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding from the current 518 million to a billion euro.
Much too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social apartments had to be created annually and the federal had to invest a grant of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Ministry of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 per cent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them when they entered, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to value in the reception society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says Migrationsforschker Dietrich Tränhardt.
In Germany, according to Tränhardt, there has been a political change: from the ban on working for refugees to recognition of work.
While there was a ban on working for asylum seekers up to five years earlier, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence requirement, which limited asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In the society - also because of the introduction of expertise - most people have the view that refugees should be given faster access to the labour market.
A large shield for access to the labour market is lack of German knowledge.
So far, there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.
Moreover, studies show that jobs are most often communicated by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore in the view of Thränhardt the King's Way to Labour Integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to Kitas, estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the developed parents, it is only once very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the Kita, the administration distributes handsets in different languages.
If the need for educators rose strongly through the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more schools.
In the countries, students with no German knowledge are prepared to teach in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by full-trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a secondary language.
They have no shortage, says Beate Materials from the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Office estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no federal state of asylum or patient prohibits the study - the only exception has so far been Berlin, Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Student refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or cancellation will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Competition Act when they start a study.
The latter do not, in principle, receive a baccalation as they do not fall within the circle of the baccalated persons.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for up to four years in order to be Bafäg-authorised, from 1 January 2016 this spanning is shorter than 15 months.
However, this funding gap also needs to be closed, Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Network.
The students should be given a bath immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should successfully deprive Islam of the same rights as they have the churches, and further develop the existing State-Church law into a new state-religious relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association, which is professionally responsible for the new arrivals.
The rights also include obligations.
In this way, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the State in many areas and provide him with certain control options.
This includes the willingness to take a stand against religious fundamentalism.
The President of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed on Thursday the concern, religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to austere such conflicts in Germany "have their right to live here, in Germany," he said in the Bavarian radio.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
Integration will be much more than today as a topic of society as a whole.
In order to change the majority society too, the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more urgent.
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti-discrimination centre and a general equality law for a few decades.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long called for and what international agreements like the Anti-racism Convention Germany are committed to, must become reality in the coming years when the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany has been able to provide medical care for the refugees expected to be, says medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"When it comes to man-power and capacity, we will create it," he said to the daily mirror.
However, additional money had to be flown into the system.
In order to avoid aggravation, Montgomery calls for all arrivals to deliver health cards at the same time as registration.
The benefits provided could later be calculated with the federal countries.
And in the long term, it would be most interesting to feed so many people with the limited performance catalogue provided by the Asylum Competition Act.
On the other hand, doctors tend to create language barriers.
Until now, as the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proved, migrants are becoming worse off with their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, interpreters have to be taken over, she demands.
However, many refugees would have been helped with more general medical procedures in emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
In refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and in young people it is HIV-declaration.
However, with the other disease images, German doctors come out of their training clearly, says Montgomery.
"Parasite seizure or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as for the lack of a doctor, it may even be an aggravation in sight by the refugees.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, however, they had to prove their qualifications and perhaps re-test them.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to the estimates of the Federal Psychotherapy Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
In particular, the refugee children are particularly vulnerable, says Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK.
A recently published study by TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with breath, dizziness, heart beats and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe scarcity and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
To date, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although psychologically ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, most professionals or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether or not a treatment is necessary.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
Many invite to dream
With the new stage of "Leadness", Circus Probst returns to the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to attract each age group into the band of fascinating acrobatics, animaldressers and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to the managee on the brick water to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chief.
"Leadness" - under this motto is the current man-made scenario.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift of enthusiasm is therefore in the blood of the family.
"It is important to take the people away from their daily struggle and take them to a completely different world for two hours," says the 27-year-old Junior Chief.
"Manegen cocktail with World City-Flair", says Director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov clown family pulls the audience with fun and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand her work.
With the heroes of the stupid movies it wants to take the Cuban duo loosely.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Except for many salmon salads, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with fingertip feeling and tenderness.
Balancing with the one wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
The snakes fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinates with their mobility.
60 Employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," says Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the attitude of circuses are only too often the subject of various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes the position: "If it's not good for our animals, it's not good for us."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four-end artists", as they are kindly called, will be read from the eyes as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to be in the mane.
So the greatest command: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhangst and a zebrastute, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
Although Zebroid is not yet ready for the manage, it is the unique mask of the Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One is sure," says Stephanie Probst, "whether five or 1,200 viewers, we always give our best and are with all our heart".
The Circus Probst invites you to his performances every day from September 17th to September 20th.
On Sunday the program begins at 11 a.m. and 16 p.m.
Thursday is a family day, prices are reduced for the show at 5:00.
In addition, the animal show is open every day from 10 to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwes Robert Mugabe holds false speeches in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year from a podium.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case spread rapidly over the social media.
The opening of the Parliament was also disturbed by the claims of the opposition's deputies that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's address with bourbons.
Last month they had built him up and interrupted him during his speech to the position of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to disrupt Mr. Mugabe's address.
"The message comes from a number that will not be displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity will end in Parliament, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "anxious" about the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and rescue efforts in the company's services.
HP will later be divided into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its services business.
The expected decommissioning leads to a charge of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard-Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger focus than it is today, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better equipped than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers all over the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion of annual turnover and "will be concentrated on the provision of unsatisfied, integrated technology solutions for companies so far," said a statement by the company.
It separates a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and whose Palo Alto Garage was named "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone massive restructuring to manage the deviation from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the conviction that highly focused companies will achieve better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere in front of the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Werner pointed out to Wilsher that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilsher will probably miss at least the next four games for England and, in view of his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big damage to this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate bone injury and had then returned to his old swing during the preseason.
"This kind of injury does not threaten your career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that doesn't heal well.
This is no big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not associated with his bones or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the corresponding risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd shows 23 different diseases of Wilsher since his debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five games.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six of eight games since 2007/08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have most days of injury to record.
Nobody accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you get back from an injury, you have an offensive period, a time when you have to strengthen your body and win the fighting force," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is putting in a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not travelling to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to take a little break," said Werner.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to continue through Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most fearsome playgrounds in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeatable after 41 games after the "unavoidable" campaign was launched in the last season.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was shaken by an earthquake, measuring 3.2 on the court scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Werner believes that Arsenal has drawn the lessons from last season with the Champions League Capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading his management to his first European-Pokal triumph.
"This drive is huge," said Wenger.
It's never hit Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in the business to be realistic.
We're jealous, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar performances in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up, now even more desperate than ever before, how suicide killings among young men prove at a 15-year-old height.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it remains three times more common for men than for women.
In an effort to address the problem, the campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a miserable life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the goal of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need it.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A current study of over 2,000 high-school students with depressive symptoms found that if the leader had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "sound mood", his chances of healing doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends half the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you need to have friends just once so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on substance-style, the immediate response is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital lives have the need to appear, strong, life-threatening and successful, doubled, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsical values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which has a far deeper impact on our spiritual health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really cannot buy happiness.
The beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of footballing in cozy chairs and the quest for Ross to Rachel - all came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even though they often refrain to fully discover their feelings.
As an employee of phone cell care, it explained to me: "My role in listening to people who feel depressed and threatened with suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old sentence "I'm right about it" has an enormous effect, like the feeling that it's perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that makes sense to me when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
It presents clearly the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective external status over the phone can also help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, when you visit this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFest with the completely redesigned scenes for the celebration of the day, why don't you take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG destroy Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his encounter against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League Season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Debüts as a PSG player who led the French champion, but then they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani achieved a top baller in the 61th minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish masters, as they not only strive for the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the fourth phenylenes in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, there was no class game by Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate. He was later in the game against his home city team and the association with which he started his illustrated career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or outside the Champions League. So it's a good start to win 2:0, to cause our opponents problems and to relax, even if there are certain things we still have to perfect during the season," Blanc said.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven't reached one or two more doors yet."
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury to one of three changes to the Paris team, which at the weekend could hold a 2:2 indistinct place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was kicked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine bird storm was described as the man who can take the PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United, and he pointed out why when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he passed by Johan Wiland in the long corner of the network.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who hit Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, attacked Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a severe opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who was far away from Kevin Trapps Pfosten in the 34th minute pass, they offered little attack.
Instead, the PSG himself sometimes turned up, with some flaws and bad conclusions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who had not less than five attempts alone in the first half and then given up after Cavani had used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more fit when he brought his fellows into the game, and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic, whom Di Maria turned into a turnout, which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the foot ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour-mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan achieved its sixth seasoner after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flag of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could get back to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the outcome low before the replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi a door was opened at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later added that the PSG played a class on his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which has not the same level.
The skill games are not enough."
Get out of Paris!
It was a great game of them!

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
World and European Master Xavi has been playing since summer 2015 for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar
The FC Bayern was apparently just a few years ago before Spain's commitment to Superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Pocal winner, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champions, two times European champions, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
In an interview with Marca, however, Xavi now betrays that he was already in front of EM 2008 before the departure from Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we won nothing," he says.
And that was also recorded by the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change didn't stop.
And the successful man is working for the German recordmaster: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has contracted Guardiola and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's playtime 2008/2009 would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the fourth final of the Champions League against the Bayers all over the distance on the race, turned off the red (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrated the Royal Class Triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity in filmmaking down
Matt Damon confronted the African American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she would not be needed behind the scenes.
During a follow-up of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the selected spinbook of the project.
"If we talk about diversity, then you do it when the film is filmed and not when the show is filmed," said Damon.
Brown reacted shockedly, with policing disbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments of the actor of The Martian got stuck.
Damon and Brown joined Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony," Brown said first.
The only black person, and she's a utility that's hit by her white container.
The producer of Dear White People took part in the film for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the director's rights; Damon pointed out that her director could "give us something at the end of what we don't want."
After the discussion was released, the social media exploded before misconception about Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts".
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when the very racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After the death of the Teenager Michael Brown in 2014 by a white police officer, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved national effect and forced legislators and authorities to offer discriminatory practices against colour content.
In February, the singer Prince played a role in the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", (Albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
In recent times, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement that, in response to the question of the Fox-News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be viewed as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," said the leaders.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media Moguls that will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior" won the first champion
Profi sports climber and operating aid Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the big price of $1 million home.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season's finals, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten made it to the finals.
The last task was to climb on a 75 foot long climbing line in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within the time when he was the first athlete to complete stage 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero ended this challenge three seconds more quickly, making him a winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard win, still under shock about the win of the $1 million prize.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never earned more than $10,000 or to live," said Isaac E! about his Haupe money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed agreed with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it will get him with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, it gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's talking about any of that.
He's just as happy to have done what he did.
Lots of awards he received from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed their roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eight staff, the rotation work will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak into Minnesota Twins past
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
They were once one of the best teams in Baseball, today the tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers were reduced to their role as a spy, but on Tuesday, this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the target field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a half of Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard Square.
For Detroit, even for one evening, it was a return of the three letters F-word, which was so difficult to capture over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victory is fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitch Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to end this year strongly," said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and so I want to concentrate on the game.
The designed Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBI since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first triple hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He squeaked the wood well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at the (schlagttraining), looked significantly better at the bullpen, and he brought it directly into play.
With three rounds in the background meeting at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Field Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left line.
Right Field Aaron Hicks reached a suit, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strike out before he was replaced by the left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Mauer, the only man with whom he was confronted, before the designed Rookie-Schlagmann Miguel Sano, who had a two-run entriss to the right-hand Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of runners and the finish run at the second pleasure, the third baseman Trevor brought to a double play.
It was the leader of the Major League 27th time this season that loops hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the nine innings, Mauer created an RBI double against the tiger's castle Bruce Rondon and achieved the status of 5-4.
However, the right-hand man ran out of Sano at three Pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a still unmoved Phil Hughes to launch the game.
The tigers scored three rounds in the first two innings against the right-hand veteran, who was cut off from the injured list before the game, after missing more than one month due to a back-up.
"Of course not the beginning that I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt better when I released and felt that I would create some pretty good Pitches there in the third inning."
After they first received the leadoff battery, Hushes gave up a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play, which created a single "up the middle" during the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 series of success with the runners in the score position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third, which ended the threat.
The tigers added in the second, a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center-fielder Anthony Gose achieved a 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a Pitch-Count, achieved no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reliever Right-Handles A.J. Later.
At Hughes it came to three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was separated due to an injury to the shells.
He is investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list due to a shoulder fracture, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris will be removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starters with the tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30th.
He has been missing since 20 August due to a collapse in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to live in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people involved will then be accommodated in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday.
It counted with 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several teams of the Hessian capital had been prepared in the past days for this case.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily displaced there.
They should then be further distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, 7500 people in Hessen have arrived, according to the Government Bureau responsible for the first admission.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sportallen because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German participation in Syria an opportunity.
"I believe that the particular thought about military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He presented to the European States "collective views".
Four years ago, it was a joy that the Kelch had passed a military participation in Germany.
"Now the conflict lands in front of our door," he said in German radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on site for refugees.
Austria controlled at the southern and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner explained on Tuesday at the Austrian TV station ORF, no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Even Germany did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement, after which Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not call concrete numbers and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Its aim is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, applied for a special summit next week.
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls.
The EU has so far been unable to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
On Tuesday (September 22nd) at a special meeting, the EU Home Minister wants to take a new call for the mandatory distribution of more than 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee campaign in Germany, the Federal Government wants to support the countries in the first and second generation of people.
The Federation will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on the following Tuesday after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister at the Berlin Office.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection also fight them.
But those who do not have a living perspective cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was explicitly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "great effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are currently on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175 km long border to Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government announced in Budapest that the border to Romania was also bordered with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU other than Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent Schlepper from seeking out routes across Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto to the planned new border crossing.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, according to eye sample reports, thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds Ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the icepan of Saturn Mond Enceladus, a global ocean floats.
That concludes researchers from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Thus, the moon easily fades on its path around the ring planets.
This thumb movement is only small, but still too large for a constantly solid heavenly body, it is called in a message from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, from Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the "Icarus" section.
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
Thus "Cassini" had already discovered 2006 ice volcanos at the south pole of Saturn, feeding the water vapour and ice particles, thus feeding the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there was to be a subterranean sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the extension of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to give up about a month on the offensive agent Valdet Rama.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury at the age of 27, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich Löwen, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced retirement".
"That's hard for us, Rama is a bitter loss."
"Of course, we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "image" section with a view to the possible commitment of an unifying profession.
As a training guest, however, the 60s first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was recently active in Belgium and was already under contract at the VfL Wolfsburg.
Croatia currently has "the opportunity to demonstrate its ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his brain injury.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is scheduled to join the race.
Okotie had injured herself in the party at Fortune Düsseldorf (0:3) in a loud crash on the head.
On the other hand, he remained without a heavy blessing.
No diet fruit - Mangos contains a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and sweet.
But those who want to follow his slender line will often be taken away from them.
Because Mangos contain relatively much sugar - mainly sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. Most of all, however, Mangos contains a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-carotene.
Therefore, those who eat the fruit support visual, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying Mangos should not be too soft or stiff and smoke pleasantly.
The shell color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within less days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or sweet food.
However, a mango also gives a special note to the court of heart.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits in well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The U.S. Package Service provides up to 95,000 aid for the Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS shared on Tuesday.
In particular, drivers are being searched.
As of last year, UPS had invested around 95,000 aid for the holiday season.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its rival FedEx have made arrangements to be armed for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries had put the package services to harsh criticism.
First wave, then marked cold face
In the coming night, the valley of the Alpennorth side of the Föhn breaks through, as Meteoshweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and at night on Thursday, the pheasant blows partly with storm strength through the pheasants.
After arriving in the middle of Thursday morning, we are surrounded by a spectacular cold front, which brings strong rainfalls, winds and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of a vast underground area over the British islands in a strong southwestern stream.
On the Alpennor side, the valley breaks into the middle of the night.
As a result, the Föhn will blow until Thursday morning in the Föhntäller with bows from 60 to 100 km/h, individually and in particular in the Urnerland, with more than 100 km/h.
On the mountains, even hurricanes are possible from over 120 km/h.
While in the north on Wednesday the stormy fan for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity starts to rise at the alpine slope.
Here are some of the rains that last until Thursday night.
In total, the Alps have to be calculated in the south in the next 48 hours with partially over 100 litres of rain per square meter, after which large amounts of rain have fallen in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the air goes out to the fan, resulting in a cold front with a strong, partially vicious rain from West to East over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind cools strongly until stormy, and the temperatures go back clearly.
The following days are presented in the north by 15 to 20 degrees in the south, on the other hand it will be sunny and warmer by the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the reform, there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, a nameless place was baptized on Wednesday in the park on the oppio hill on behalf of the German Reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Luthero" he is now rated as "German Theology of Reform".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name was applied for by the working community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Community in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes over the centuries could often live their faith as a minority only in the hidden.
The place will symbolically show that their tradition of Christian belief in Rome has been welcomed.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) held himself as a young Augustiner monk for the 1510/11 anniversary in Rome for a few months.
He received the city at that time as a condemned sinner.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome in the eyes of historians.
Luther then began the division of the evening church with his teasings against the casualty trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) Dornekron is one of the main works Otmar Old painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At first, was it the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which now appeared with magnificent images.
At first, the picture was for Otmar Old, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and fantastic shapes has been received by the 75-year-olds - but it is not the same with "listening" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to each subject, it can seem quite dark.
About three years ago, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he met a subjective and artistic selection from the many topics of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have been created that dedicate themselves to issues such as crossroads, plagues, commandments or fathers' cousins.
As a result, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther edition with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler edition with its focus on books of art.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who, on the basis of the painting, has intertwined with the respective Bible sites.
He interpreted the Bible sites chosen by Otmar Old and thus translated into today's context.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible site of Martin Luther and each of them a set of artists, who here formulates his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry belt has golden letters.
Thus the 75-year-old alike doubles a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Finally, emotions were triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant orders of the Lord.
"The education was done with the pipestock," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this out so that I may be able to make a deal with the Lord Father again."
His second concern was to help art in a fast-paced time again to increase its value: "The perception of image worlds today is marked by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolically, it's being forced.
Artists have another desire and desire to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "influence" into the images, let them affect themselves, discover and sense the power they have: "The image is looking for its opposite."
Klaus Altepost was present on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Fiftung, "always" a lover of Otmar's old art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Old people did not pay attention to fully grasping the Bible, but they chose important, even mysterious, subjects for it.
"It was not cooperation on eye height," Altepost says, "this is about the images that the text explains only".
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "increasing his life and finding freedom".
Otmar Old images speak for Möhler both the (bible) language of love and the responsibility.
Part of the original - paper and canvas images - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened at the Otmar-Alt Foundation on 15 November.
Start of construction for BMX track close
Plans made, space found, company commissioned, rearrest modeled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX train was finished again.
Political and administrative omissions, especially among the inhabitants who did not want the train, were caused by confusion.
So the hills are torn apart, looking for a new place - now with formal planning and application for construction approval.
The approval will take place in October, the first municipality of Sabine Mosbach-Bock was able to announce to the Committee on Children and Youth.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It should then start with the work of the former hall bathroom without a "further memory break".
DFB intensified engagement for refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019, the Bundesliga sets a clear sign at the weekend.
The football reacts to the inconspicuous situation in Germany, and politics ensures its help in dealing with the problems ahead.
"I have considered this to be the biggest challenge of our country since the reunification."
"There's no one in principle saying that I don't care, I don't have anything to do with it."
"This must interest every individual in getting this topic into the grip," said DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At an annual meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I am in the office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor there."
"There will certainly be a central role to play," he announced.
The football can and will help.
But the decisive flaws must be the policy.
The German Football Union has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" for four years.
"On the Egidius-Brown Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach said on the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federalists also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professionals have a clear sign when they are wearing the impression "We help - #refugeeswelcome" instead of the other usual sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how only they can," said Leverkusen Sports Manager Rudi Völler of the "Picture" section (Tuesday) and described the project as "self-understanding".
"The Refugee Drama is everybody's on, no one can see away."
"We can, no, we need to use our radiation power, our influence and our opportunities to help many refugees who have suffered so incrediblely," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's CEO Peter Justig spoke of a "prominent sign of the League".
On Friday, the National Team of Women invites 100 refugees to Hall/Saale to the EM Qualification Game against Hungary.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as "a large community of German football".
That all 36 licensing associations have started their own projects in their places, be great.
It's just as great that small and smaller associations are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have published, is live in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The associations have already collected the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
The CEO of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, has lost his left eye, according to several reports by a storm at the beginning of July.
In the case of the accident at his brother's house in the United States, after midnight he fell on a glass of water which he had carried in his left hand, the "Employment Week" reported on Wednesday.
"He's almost fainted, he was powerless, then he slipped out on the street - that's how he told us last week," says the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could follow his work.
"In early October we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was at the meeting and "full-time".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutschen Zeitung" (Donnertags issue), he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software groups.
"I'm full for SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually lasts between Germany and the USA, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP centre in Walldorf.
To him it was important to go with such a personal story to the public, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can do something like this."
"It's important to get up again when you fall."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen except fight ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was disturbed by the wheel.
Therefore, he comes in the middle of the night in Singapore on the weekend as little as a reserve leader for the two tribal pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as one week later at the Japan Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without giants against Krasnodar: Weidenfields in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus have finally collapsed in the first group game of Europe League.
The national player will also miss the table leader of the football league also in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (9.00/Sky).
"We can't take it back," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be on Sunday at the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen again, the BVB coach opened: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
Given the high load of his profession, Tuchel will not only change his strain on the giant position.
That's how he announced a change in the torhüter position.
That's why Roman Weiden fields take the place of the tribekeeper Roman Bürki.
"He is training on an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, if weddenfields are to be used in all European League games in the future, Tuchel opened up.
He'll probably fight the second party too.
The research statement by fellow players Reus that the final entry for the BVB in Europe League must be the target, says middle-field player Julian Weigl: "Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robote cars: Government wants a leading role for Germany
Germany is supposed to be a technological pioneer after the will of the Federal Government when the car changes.
The Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car fair from a "new mobility timer".
The automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less stability, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 States, who also associate with representatives of industry in the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's strategy paper highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband development and a rapid growth in digital radio.
To test new technology, a test line is currently in place on the 9th motorway in Bayern.
In order to ensure that the driver is "no additional liability risks", the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
Thus Germany intends to make an international effort to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-propelled cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government will also make use of an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car increasingly takes the driving, the driver becomes more and more passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data quickly in seconds.
After a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated road rides will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, roadless vehicles on public roads are "to be expected long after 2020".
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the Pkws can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPD Transport Politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of drivers should be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptically - much more than French or American.
A survey submitted on Wednesday at the AA by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Dekra test organisation resulted in only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be implemented in the next ten years, 32 percent only in 20 years, and 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, up to 2025, 21 per cent of the surveyees have autonomously driven cars, 33 per cent in the USA.
Nevertheless, the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the journey on all roads.
On the motorway, however, this could be represented by 15 per cent in the ongoing traffic, 45 per cent in the stau.
Good every quarter would leave the car under no circumstances.
Boll quits team and double start at table tennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to fight in the title battles from September 25th to October 4th only in detail.
The final decision shall take place at the latest on 22 September.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys have learned it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsoring term in China at that time.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Jekaterinburg, also recalled the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Then Timo also failed, and we became European champions."
"Darran should guide us," explained the World rankings.
The English football national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg.
At the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defendant was hit by Héctor Moreno and was replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a break in the neck of the 20-year-old fellow of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a growing figure-grass cabinet: designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The high points: Schaufensterpuppen, which thanks to video projections look scary human.
They bring the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things with Madonna's stage outfits, became the big star of fashion - and so that he put men in a dress.
"I can't say today that I'm the child terrible of the skin couture because I have white hair."
"Before it was lighted, in the meantime it is real," said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (from the citizens' ladder to the race), which is to be seen in the art hall of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation from September 18th, it is a lucky thing that the fashion designer has initially changed his negative attitude to a show about his person.
In fact, he was on the other side because, "I heard an exhibition a little after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Art Hall, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the man's hardly to be overlooked, who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographical work of art, for which much effort has been made: for example, a stylist was engaged to refresh the dolls.
14 tons of material have been sent by the makers according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the beginning of the October festival, there was still a special hammock: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women (“Women are tougher than men”) and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy is also seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the first, curious fashion experiments of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football) he wore his Teddy BHs and clothing, Gaultier said.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The design of fashion he later joined himself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, though, I bought it, of course.
For his first fashion show he couldn't pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the rags.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener tipze as fashion niches
Previously it went to the long stick machines to make a meter.
The glued materials and tips were produced in large quantities for customers who, for example, further processed to roofs and gardens.
This alone does not work today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Fashionspitze Plauen.
Instead, the fashion is important again.
The fashion played a larger role in the early days of the Plauener Spitze, was then forced by the home textile industry - and is now discovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: peaks in jewelry, with accessories such as pockets and regional suits.
At all, the so-called Vintage mode, which is based on past style pockets, is an increasing contract potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all the orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spitze and Stickerie industry association with nine other companies.
Only they can wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of the turnover has been lost.
There are almost no private trades and even wholesale trade.
Our products are barely reaching customers this way.
The mass goods are now much cheaper in the Asian space and almost exclusively distributed via chains.
In addition, exports to Russia and the United States are weakening.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The Association of Industry also tries to point out through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stick Pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have been leading a quality seal, which shows that we are producing environmentally and socially acceptable".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger outside of the West Saxony University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in stickers and tips.
In order to counter competition from the Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the latest ideas of designers and the companies that have to think economically in particular," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design will often vary only slightly to keep a customer strain.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter relived the historical snowball tip.
The machine plugs small balls in some places.
The Plauen goldsmither Bianca Hallabach-krauße was inspired by this: "Before, I couldn't start anything with traditional Plauen's tip".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In a demanding process, she touches the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuters.
It also delivers to the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose predecessors have lived in the plauen and the surrounding area and who want a piece of memory.
So I see my beauty as the modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney planted new Mary Poppins movie
You shouldn't touch legends, but Disney is still watching a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, it is not about a refilming, but about a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first movie with the magic child girl.
It's about the experiences of Nanny and the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Whoever plays Poppins for more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already standing: Rob Marshall, last time with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi insists to open the economy wider for the world
The economy needs to open more widely outside to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday a group commissioned to drive the reform.
"China should work towards attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business-based strategies," he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
To promote new foundations and to advance reforms will lead to new momentum and vitality and provide a new place for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access arrangements, the relaxation of border control policies, the promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), private capital, and the overhaul of the population reporting system.
After the status, a negative list will be created identifying sectors and companies that are not in question for investments.
The system is tested every time and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loose checks on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The Statement also said that China will be allowed to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open State-controlled sectors, further areas of private investment will be opened.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," the Statement said.
Moreover, it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to ensure the exercise of their duties and the appointment of professional judges and civil servants was also discussed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also took part in the meeting, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double the value of mercury in ruminant fish
The European Commission wants to double the thresholds for mercury in large ruminants and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve poison.
The Foodwatch Consumer Organisation, which has a corresponding EU working paper, criticised the plans with strong criticism: "The risks and adverse effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are further addressed with full attention to pregnant and minors," said Matthias Wolfschmidt von Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shark or swordfish for "economic political reasons" are to be raised by one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
But large predatory fish are already so heavily loaded today with mercury that about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the existing limit values.
After double the limit values, only 14.5 per cent would be unsold.
In contrast to this closure, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to increase the limits for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, referred to this as "trick", because smaller fish, such as carpfs, are usually so low that they already observe the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfect decomposition manoeuvre that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt explained.
Quecksilber is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched by the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "almost small amounts can cause particular harm to the nervous system in the case of unborn babies".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment, however, states on its homepage that there is no "health risk for the general population".
Quecksilber is mainly due to carbon burning in the environment.
According to a written statement by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal plants are at the disposal of the Green-Bendägsagsag-dealer Annalena Baerbock more than six tons of mercury per year, two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, e.g. in Elbe, Rhein and Donau, was "permanently surpassed and flat-covered", the "pecker" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year European warnings against mercury in fish already included the most frequently reported health risks in the EU Warning System RASFF.
