The members of the Wales Assembly (AM) are concerned about the possibility of being "recognised as an apex"
Some members of the assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament — Member of the Wales Parliament).
Its purpose is to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament (Velsa Parliament).
AM throughout the political spectrum is concerned that it can make them a funny object.
One of the Leiborist parties AM explained that their group is concerned with "consonances with the words Twp and Pwp".
To readers outside Wales: The Welsh word "twp" means "unity", but "pwp" means "cake".
The Plaid AM indicated that none of the groups were "unsatisfied" and recommended alternatives.
The representative of the Vels Conservative Party acknowledged that their group was ready to examine the change of name, but added that "MWP" is very similar to "Muppet", which means "arm".
In this context, it should be taken into account that the English word "w" is similar to the English word "u" in Yorkshire dialect.
The Committee of Assembly, which is currently preparing for the amendment of the name of the bill, informed: "The final decision on the terms to be used for the appointment of members of the assembly is, of course, to be adopted by the members of the assembly itself."
The Act of the Government of Wales granted the Wales Assembly the right to change its name in 2017.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation of the proposals and received broad support for the change of the name of the assembly to the Wales Parliament.
As regards the name AM, the Commission gave preference to the Welsh Parliament Member (WMP), but MWP received the greatest support in the public consultation.
AM clearly recommends alternative options, but the fight for an agreement can bring headache to Elin Jones (Elin Jones), who is expected to submit a bill on change in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes to the work of the assembly, including legislation on the disqualification of AM and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on how they will be called will be taken when the legislative acts have been discussed.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in the name of the country
The vote will take place on Sunday in the vote, whether their country name will be changed to the 'North-Macedonian Republic'.
The national vote was organised to resolve long-standing disputes with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, for decades.
Athens has long argued that the name of the North Neighbor has given rise to claims on its territory and has already repeatedly objected to Macedonia's request to be accepted by the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov (Gjorge Ivanov), one of the plebiscite on the name changers, announced that ignoring the vote,
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev (Zoran Zaev), argue that the change of name simply is a matter to be done to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's call to hear the church of Harlem fight for existence.
"As the old people I've been talking to have been on every corner before," says Mr. Adamsa.
"Now there is neither one nor the other."
He recognizes that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer home to the living rooms that people visit on a regular basis."
Speaking even to the gods, he is concerned that the money he receives when selling property will end faster than the leaders hope, "and sooner or later they will return at the beginning".
Goddess, he added, may be replaced by multidwelling buildings with apartments where people who are not going to help the rest of the temples around them will be buried.
"Most people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and therefore the day will come when these gods will turn forever, because it is unlikely that most people who will gather in these apartments will become members of these congregations."
Both deities were raised by the white congregation, before Harlem became a black metropolis, in 1870 by the Metropolitan Community, and 10 years later by St. Martin.
The original white Methodist congregation was abandoned in the 1930 ’ s.
The building took on a black congregation that had served God alongside him.
The Black Congregation of St. Martin’s Goddess took over his blessings during John Howard Johnson. He led a boycott of workers at 125th Street, Harlem, who had refused to work in the blacks or to give them an increase.
In 1939, the fire was seriously damaged, but since the members of the Johnson congregation planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call.
His blessing is David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to the St. Martin's congregation, proudly called the call game "for poor people's calls".
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: "Cultural treasure" and "historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng (Tiffany Ng) from Michigan University added that it was the first call game in the world played by the black musician Dionysius A. Linds (Dionysio A. Lind), who moved 18 years ago to the larger call game in the Church of the Riversidas.
Mr. Merivezer (Merriweather) said that the St. Martin's congregation did not stop him.
The events of the last few months around St. Martin’s goddess have reflected the relationship between contemporary architects and builders, some of whom have been engaged in the work of the temporary authority, and others — the diocese of the episcopal church.
In July, the Council of the Congregation, formed by the temporary leaders, addressed the diocese in writing with concerns that the diocese would "try to pay the costs" to the Council, although the Council had not been involved in the settlement of the desiccated architects and builders.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
The shark injured 13-year-olds in the omar fishing area
The shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California and injured him. It was the first day of the lobster season, a storyteller.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near the Beacon's Beach in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel (Chad Hammel) informed the KSWB-TV Sandjego that he and his friends had been nil for about half an hour in the morning when he heard that the boy was calling for help, and then the group came to him to help him pull the boy out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he had thought that it was simply a thrill for the nailed lobster, but then he "understands that the boy screams" I said!
I'm sick of it!"
All his key bones were loosened," Hammel said, who immediately noticed it when he had gone to the boy.
"I climb to leave the water: "There is a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transferred by air to Reidia (Rady) ’ children’s hospital in Sandjego, where his condition was considered critical.
The species of attacked shark is unknown.
In the meantime, Captain Larry Giles reported that a few weeks earlier, a shark had been observed in this area, but it was recognized that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Jails added that the victim was traumatized by the upper part of the rubber.
Officials for the investigation period and security purposes for 48 hours closed access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca (Casablad) to Swami (Swami's) Ensinitas (Encinitas).
Jails pointed out that more than 135 shark species are present in this area, but most are not considered as dangerous humans.
Sainsbury's plans to impress the UK industry's beauty market
"Sainsbury's" goes on to attack "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with universal-style beauty-making products for hair rows and trained sellers.
As part of the substantial contribution of the United Kingdom to the large beauty market of 2.8 billion barrels, which continues to grow, although the decline of fashion goods and household items will decrease, 11 shops in the United Kingdom will be tested for higher beauty products, and, if all the tracks are successful, the next year will be more.
In the beauty sector, funds are invested when the supermarket is looking for opportunities to use hair that were previously allocated to televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
"Sainsbury's" announced that they would double their offers in the field of beauty collection up to 3000 products, including brands such as "Revlon", "Essie", "Tweezerman" and "Dr. PawPaw" for the first time.
The existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more places with brand zones similar to those in the Boots shops.
The supermarket also re-markets its "Boutique" decorative cosmetic line, where most products will be friendly to vegans, which are increasingly required by younger buyers in years.
In addition, the fragrance wholesaler Fragrance Shop will try a concession in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, but the second will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the transition to small food purchases every day in local stores means that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
The CEO of Sainsbury's Mike Coups has said that the trading venues of the goods will become more and more like universal stores, because the store chain is trying to fight with the discount shops "aldi" and "Lidl", offering a larger range of services, but without food.
"Sainsbury's" has placed the Argos trading venues in several hundred shops and has opened several "Habitats" since bought both chains two years ago, which is claimed to have improved the sales of goods and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended with decay.
The "Sainsbury's" joint venture with "Boots" was tried in the beginning of 2000, but the Union went off after a dispute to share income from pharmacies stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after "Sainsbury's" 3 years ago sold its 281 large pharmaceutical business to the owner of the "Celesio", "Lloyds Pharmacy" chain, for 125 million brands.
Under this plan the task of Lloyds will be to supplement the range with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hiks (Paul Mills-Hicks), commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "In order to improve the intended environment for customers, we have transformed the look of the hairline of our beauty products and the impression it creates.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our brand range has been designed to meet all needs, but the attractive environment along with the convenient location means that we are now a dazzling goal on the way to beauty, a goal that challenges the past purchases."
Peter Jones "the whole business" after Holly Willovia's refusal to pay 11 million bills
"Dragon Den" star Peter Jones (Peter Jones) "takes the nest" after the TV broadcast leader Holly Willoughby refused 11 million bills of deal with his lifestyle brand to pay all attention to his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Vilnius has no time to devote their home clothes and accessories to the "Truly" brand.
The two business was compared to the Guinean Paltrow (Gwyneth Paltrow) brand Goop.
This Morning 37-year-old broadcaster used Instagram to report that she was leaving.
Hollija Viloubia has abandoned the Dragon Den star Peter Jones in anger, for the last moment he left his profitable lifestyle brand business – to pay attention to his new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources of information claim that Jones was "full of business", when the TV girl closed the meeting on Tuesday at his business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant that she no longer had the time to dedicate her home clothes and accessories to the "Truly" brand.
The company was compared to the Guinette Platrov brand Goop, and according to the house, it twice increases the wealth of Vilnius, which is estimated to reach 11 million mark.
When Wilubia (37) used Instagram to report leaving "Truly", Jones moved away from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
As the source of information says: "Truly" was the main priority of the Holly.
This was to become her long - term future, dedicated to her in the decades to come.
Her decision to resign surprised all the non-prepared participants.
No one was able to believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
In the centre of Marlov, there is a warehouse for the sale of ready-to-sale goods."
Experts believe that the leader of "This Morning" who is one of the most financially profitable stars can pay millions to the company, as a lot of money has been invested in various products — from lightnings and candles, to clothing and goods at home, and it will be even more delayed to place them on the market.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Three children’s mother, Willovia, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
"Truly" was created with Kep in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the president in March.
Both of them have a total holiday, and Jones owns 40% of the shares of the Boldvina TV producers.
Wilubia must become a brand M&S Ambassador, and she will replace Entu Makpartlin (Ant McPartlin) as ITV'm A Celebrity's leader.
"We don't want to comment on his business."
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was concerned about the criticism received from the news companies about a comment that some might consider to be 'inappropriate to the President' and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why does the President have so much to give up?
Tramps said in his image in the voice of the "narrator of knowledge".
"I didn't say anything!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting again after Trump recognized their initial meeting in Singapore as a big step against North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations on denouncing have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of the main North Korean diplomats Ri Yongho (Ri Yong Ho) informed world leaders in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see the "responsibility" of the US towards the initial steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he indicated that the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
The tramps in their home speech were much more optimistic.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were preparing to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have these great relationships."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had resulted in a positive outcome — the cessation of the missile testing tests, the release of the beneficiaries, and the return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's just to create the President's impression, but instead of standing 10,000 people out there trying to get into this very populated area, we have 200, here, here," Trump said, pointing to the effort directly ahead of him.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia dropped the island by killing hundreds of people
Following the Lomboca earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they did not need assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lomboka were displaced, the state of the national disaster was not announced, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international help, so it is a known problem," the young woman Sombung acknowledged.
Although "Save children" collects groups to travel to Paul, it is still unclear whether foreign workers can work there.
The representative of the National Disasters Agency, Mr Sutopo, explained that the Indonesian officials valued the position of Paul in order to see if the international agencies could make their contribution to help.
Given that earthquakes occur regularly in Indonesia, the country is still extremely negative to the natural habitat.
Although Aceh (Aceh) has been established in the case of parachute tsunamis, these occur rarely along other coasts.
Most likely, the loss of people was also the result of Paul’s failure to heed the warning sirens of the tsunami, although the warning was valid.
Even the most favorable times between the many islands of Indonesia are the challenges.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship hospital, which had settled in Lombo to treat earthquake victims, is now going to Paul, but it will take at least three days to reach the new victims.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Widodo) had made the improvement of Indonesia's lost infrastructure a central point of his election campaign, and he has allocated large amounts to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has been paid by the administration of Mr. Joco and he is awaiting a re-election next year.
Furthermore, Mr. Joko has to face the prolonged problem of tension between sections of Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were killed from their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using cats, bows, and bullies, and other primitive weapons.
See: player "Liverpool" Daniel Starridge with a veil restores balance in the match against "Chelsea"
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the premier, winning the doors at the 89th minute Saturday game in the Stanford Bridge stadium in London.
The Starridge received a signal from Gerdan Shakiri (Xherdan Shaqiri), approximately 25 metres (30 yards) from the Chelsea gate when his team lost by 1:0.
He moved the bomb slightly to the left of himself and then pushed the bomb toward the next gate stop.
In this attempt, the bomb flew high across the field, reaching the top of the network.
Finally, the bomb swept over the head of Kep Arrizabalaga (Kep Arrizabalaga) and entered the network.
"I just tried to get their position to get to the bomb, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to get as much time as possible," Starridge explained LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante (Kantte) approaching, bubbling, and, without much thought, struggling."
In the Middle Ages, Chelsea was led by 1:0 after the words were received in 25 minutes by the Belgian star Edén Azards (Eden Hazard).
The Blues fan played the bomb back to Mateo Kovacic (Mateo Kovacic) before going back to the middle of the field and sitting fast on the side of Liverpool.
Kovačičs quickly played and received the bomb back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful seat between the players, allowing Azardam to enter the area.
Azard's speed of survival and completed the combination, with the left leg carrying a seat on the further brake network, along the "Liverpool" of Elison Becker (Alisson Becker).

Chelsea will meet at 3 p.m. on Thursday with Videoton in the UEFA League.
The number of victims in Indonesia reaches 832 people
The number of earthquake and tsunami victims in Indonesia has reached 832 people, the National Disaster Agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were reported to have been isolated in the caves of buildings after 7.5 magnitudes of large earthquake that hit the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (~6,0 m) high waves, the agency’s representative Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Sutopo Purwo Nugroho) informed the news conference.
In the city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, the ruins of the ruined buildings were covered.

The investigation was initiated after the woman’s body was found in Birkenhead (Birkenhead), Merseyside.
A 44 - year - old victim with a hole was found at 7.55 p.m. in Grayson Mews Street, John, and suspected of murder by a 32 - year - old man.
The police have called for people in this neighborhood who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brians O'Hagan reported: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite you to contact us all who were on John's street in Birkenhed and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also call on any, especially taxi drivers who might have fixed something in their car video recorder materials to contact us, because they may have information important to our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was Birkenheda's local resident, and she was found in her property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to a crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation will continue, and as the police reported, they are working on informing the victim’s closest relatives.

Kromvela statue in parliament becomes the latest "historic rewriting" scandal
Their refusal would be ethically justified in view of the activities similar to those of the Taliban, which resulted in its fanatical Puritan followers burying so many of the monuments of England's culture and religion.
However, the Kromvela Society described Mr. Crick's proposals as "multitudes" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Kromwell Society, said: "In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Kromvel's figure would also become a target outside the castle of Westminster.
Cromwell himself neither ordered to perform nor carried out the massacre during the wars of the English citizens.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of his past actions in the past century.
The beautiful image of Sera William Hamo Thorneycroft shows the viewpoint of the 19th century and is part of the history of a person who, as many believe, is still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith informed Sunday Telegraph: "Many Cromwells — perhaps by the end of the 19th century it was more than today — considered Parliament's advocate against external pressure, which, of course, was monarchy in his case.
There will be further historical discussions on whether it is really a fully-acquired picture of the theme.
Clearly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the future development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognizable personality that represents one of the parties to the long-standing distinction.
She has achieved, being a Lord's protector, is worth celebrating and mentioning."
Pig-snake until death raisins farmers in China
According to information from local media, the pig market attacked and killed the farmer in the south-west of China.
The man — mentioned only by his name Juan (Yuan) — was found dead with excess artery, all in the same blood at the pig market in Liupanshui in Guijo Province, Guizhu reported on Sunday "South China Morning Post".
Pigs are prepared to inject the vaccine into pigs in the Chinese province of China (Qinghai) on 30 May 2005.
It has been reported that he and his cousin had returned from the neighbouring Union provinces on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his brother found a man dead and found out that a door was open next to the pigs.
He told me that there was a big pig's father in the belly with blood on his mouth.
According to the information, the judicial medical investigation confirmed that 550 pounds (~249 kg) of heavy cattle had been laid off by the farmer.
"My brother's legs were bloody and twisted," said the brother – only his name was mentioned, "Guyang Evening News".
The security camera material showed how Juan enters the market around 4:40 p.m. about Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Juan did not belong to him or his brother.
The Market Manager reported "Evenning News", that the vet was turned on to prevent its attacks on others while the police picked up evidence instead of the event.
According to the information, the Black family and market management are discussing compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, other swine attacks are known to occur in humans.
In 2016, pigs attacked the woman and the man at his farm in Massachusetts, resulting in a man having a critical injury.
Just 10 years ago, 650 pounds (~295 kg) of heavy pigs in Wales had farmers pressed onto the tractor until his wife was killed by animals.
After farmers ate his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba, CBC News, explained that pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood taste can act as a gun gun.
"They're just fun.
They like to intrude, they're very familiar... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
Orkana Rosa's conclusion brings widespread and strong cases to the south-west of the United States
As predicted, Orkan Rosa, moving across the coldest waters to the northern coast of Mexico, will slow down.
However, within the next few days, Rosa will bring the rainstorms to the north of Mexico and to the south-west of the United States.
On the five afternoons (after the North American Time) the pink windmills reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour) corresponding to the hurricane category 1 and its point was 620 km (385 miles) south of Punta Eigenia (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific, there is a low pressure inlet moving east towards the eastern coast of the United States. For Roses with tropical wind power approaching the Lower California (Baja California) peninsula, it will begin to take the wet mass deep from the troupe strip north towards the south-east of the United States.
Rose will bring up to 10 inches (~25,4 cm) rain in the part of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity, combined with the nearby low pressure inlet, will then establish a wide range of heavy rainwaters during the coming days in the south-west.
1-4 inches (~2,6-10,2 cm) in the rains will cause dangerous sudden floods, double currents and possibly land caves in the desert.
The dampness will result in a deep drop from the tropical band of rain gases, which will reach between 2 and 3 inches (~5,1 and 7,6 cm) in an hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west part, in particular most Arizona, rains are expected up to 24 inches (~5,2–10,1 cm).
Sudden floods with rapid deterioration of the situation due to the spread of tropical rains are possible.
It is very unpleasant to go to the desert due to tropical rainstorms.
Strong rains can turn cannons into rapid rivers, but they will soon bring local brilliance winds and sandstorms.
The low pressure plug will bring local strong lines of South California.
There are possible rain gases that together exceed half the hills (~1,3 cm), and this may cause small double currents and sliding paths.
It will be the region's first rainy season.
Certain distributed tropical rain gases will begin to reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rains take over a wider area late Monday and early Tuesday.
A strong rain will spread on Tuesday in the Four Streets region (DR Colorado, DA Júta, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and long all Wednesday.
In October there are potential for intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as Arctic temperatures are falling, but tropicals are still quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in the temperature at a short distance.
This is an example of the dramatic differences in temperature in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
The difference between the temperature in the city of Kansas, Egypt, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Senluis and Demon (Des Moines), Aiov, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, it will try to form and expand a long summer heat.
It is expected that most of the U.S. central and eastern parts will begin in October with a temperature of 80 and more degrees (by Farenheit; ~27 degrees after Celsius) in wide areas from south-east to part-north-east.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday (by Farenheit; ~27 degrees after Celsius), which would exceed the average of about 10 degrees.
Our long-term weather forecasts show that the first half of October will exceed the average temperature in the eastern US.
More than 20 million people attended a hearing in the Breta Caveno case
More than 20 million people in the six television channels on Thursday were thrilled to see the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaisey Ford, who accused Kaveno of sexual harassment, as reported by a woman in the 1980 ’ s.
Meanwhile, political unresolved, the broadcasters stopped regular broadcasting to report on the latest developments on Friday: the agreement organised by Senator Jeff Fleik (Jeff Flake) of Arizona that the FIB will investigate charges for weeks.
Forda informed the Senate Judicial Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kaveno had robbed them of their drinking and tried to get clothes off during high school.
The coffee was unscrupulous and showed that he was absolutely convinced that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen, it was all seen by 20.4 million people on Friday.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC registered the interests of the average viewers.
Data on other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this were not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" usually creates problems, including the people who are watching the offices.
To get a better picture, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of exclusive games or Oscar ceremony observers.
"Fox News Channel", whose commentators strongly supported the Kaveno appointment, was the largest number of viewers, on average 5.69 million during a long hearing, reported "Nielsen".
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS committed 3.1 million, NBC -- 2.94 million, MSNBC -- 2.89 million, and CNN -- 2.52 million, reported "Nielsen".
The interest remained strong after the hearing.
Fleek was the central figure of the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican team had issued a statement that he was voting on the appointment of the Caveno, the senator observed the CNN and CBS camera Friday morning, when he, accompanied by protestors' conference bellows, tried to get by the elevator to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
In the live broadcast CNN he stood for several minutes in the dark of his eyes as a funeral.
"I'm standing here right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told that "you have power until so many women are powerless."
Fleuk explained that his team had made a statement and before the elevator door closed, he informed him that he had something else to say at the hearing of the committee.
Cable networks and broadcasters were reflected on the Internet several hours later when the Judicial Committee was preparing to vote on the opening of the Caveno for the Senate.
However, Fleik claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FIB would look at the charges brought by the candidates, which the minority of the Democrats had asked for next week.
Fleik was partially convinced of the negotiations with Chris Coons, a fellow democratic senator.
After the discussion with Kúns and several other senators, Fleiks made his decision.
Fleika's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have a vote to approve the Caveno without an investigation.
President Tramps has commissioned the FIB to investigate the allegations raised against Kaveno (Kavanaugh).
British Prime Minister Meja accuses critics of political games because of Brexit
Prime Minister Tereza Meja, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused people who criticised her plan to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Teresa Meja attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, next to an interview with their newspaper on the first page, Minister Boris Jones of the Mejas once again continues to attack her Brexit Plan on the future relationship with the United Kingdom with the European Union, so called the Chequers Plan, stressing that the proposal for Britain and the EU to use each other's tariffs is "fullly absurd".
Type-Sims Shooting: Police have arrested Diteon Simpson, who is suspected of killing the LSU player
Police have arrested suspects of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketballist.
The 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested and arrested as accused of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge reported.
The officials released a video showing the Simsa clash with Simpson, and the police mentioned that Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
The CBS daughter WAFB reports that police glasses were found in the crime scene and Simpson's blood was found on them.
After understanding Simpson, the police informed him that he had confessed to killing the Way.
As the lawyer reports, he was given $350,000 in security.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Medical Expert team of the East Baton Rouge on Friday issued a provisional conclusion stating that death was the cause of a bullet in the head that hits the neck.
The Department thanked the Operational Group for seeking out police refugees from the state of Louisiana, the State Police Laboratory, the South University Police and the people of the territory for their assistance in the investigation of the outcome of the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva (Joe Alleva) thanked the territorial lawmakers for their "religion and work on behalf of justice".
Simss was 20 years old.
6 feet 6 inches (~1,98 m) long climber grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
In the last season he won on average 5,6 points and 2,6 dropped bombs in one game.
On Friday morning LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team is "striked" and "shocked" about the type of death.
"That's what people always worry about," said Type.
Volcano Slaps Ass by Mexico
The forest, which rises from Pocatepetl volcano, has reached the southern surroundings of Mexico’s capital.
After the vessel’s activity was observed and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano.
The centre was observed several times assembling and shaking.
The images on the social networks showed that the car windmill in Mexico, such as Hochimilko (Xochimilco), is covered with a plan ash layer.
Geophysics have observed 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the activation of the existing volcano in the capital, since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit the central part of Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence-supported protestors clashed with the public order police and when thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising separation vote in Catalonia.
The group’s masked separation supporters, who were delayed by the public order police, fed them with eggs and dyed the powder-shaped color by forming dark dust clouds in the streets, which would normally be full of tourists.
Inconsistency was also later set up, and policemen used boots to prevent fights.
For several hours, groups of independent supporters were involved in the confrontation with united supporters, who sang: "For long life for Spain!"
As reported in the local newspapers, fourteen people were given medical assistance due to minor injuries during the protests.
The year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid recognized as illegal but endorsed by the Catalans, the idea of independence in the occupied region remains a great deal of tension.
The vote was firmly independent, although voters' activities were low, and those against separation were mostly boycotted.
According to the Catalonian official, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop voting at polls throughout the region, and there were violent clashes.
Independent support groups had broken down on Friday night in order to prevent demonstrations in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose another way.
Narciss Teremez (Narcis Termes), a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer expected Catalonia to gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with tears of joy that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the parties supporting Catalonia's independence won the regional elections last year with a small but significant surplus, these parties have struggled to maintain the momentum this year, as many of the most famous leaders have either emigrated, or are also detained and awaiting a trial for their role in organising and following the declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Hoans Puig (Joan Puig), who filmed protests on the phone in support of the police, said that the two sides' politicians had created the conflict.
"The judgment is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders, Uriah Zinkerez (Oriol Junqueras), who has been in detention for the previous year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament's election next year.
"The candidacy of European will is the best way of reversing the democratic values and repression that the Spanish government has directed against us," he said.
Londonderija: Men arrested after car crashing in the building
Three men (aged 33, 34 and 39) were arrested after the car was repeatedly hit by a building in London.
The incident occurred at Balinagard Crescent about 7.30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Inspector Bobs Blemings reported that the gates were damaged and the building itself.
At the same time, the machine may have been fired from the plane.
The Mengos trigger allows "Livingston" with 1-0 to win "Rangers"
Dollija Mengas (Dolly Menga) was the first door to win Livingston
The supported "Livingston" shocked the "Rangers" by bringing Stephen Gerard (Steven Gerrard) to his second loss in 18 games, played in the role of Ibrox Club Manager.
The Dollija Mengas hit was the decisive one, because Gerija Holta (Gary Holt) team matched the situation with "Hibernian".
The Gerard team did not win this championship season, and the next weekend they have to meet with the head of Hearts, from which they are left behind by eight points.
Before that, on the Thursday of the European League, "Rangers" took on the "Rapid" of Vienna.
Meanwhile, "Livingston" extended its series without losing in the division to six games, and the main coach Holts has not yet felt the taste of defeat, since last month changed Kenya Miller (Kenny Miller).
Livingston not used against blue guests
Holta team with their own direct game, which in various ways made it difficult to "Rangers", had to be in control for a long time before they got their names.
Scott Robinson broke out, but pulled his attempts at the door, then Alan Litgova (Alan Lithgow) tried to get in the feet to delay Craig Halkett's head-crossing of the door line.
The owners allowed the "Rangers" to play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to stop the guests in the planned places.
And that's exactly how the decisive gates came in.
"Rangers" allowed freedom, and "Livingston" used the corridor, Declan Galagher (Declan Gallagher) and Robinson joined to provide an opportunity for Mengam, who sat and got gates from the center of the area.
At this stage, "Rangers" managed the bomb, but the protection of the guests turned out to be impenetrable and the guards of Liam Kelly.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) allowed Kelly to save the gates.
Scott Pittman's attempt to stop the activities of Alan Makgregor's guard, and Litgov borrowed the long gates in Livingston combination.
The Livingston area continued to be a centred bomb, but two calls for a sentence — after Halket’s fight for a bomb with Glenn Middleton (Glenn Middleton) and for hand-playing — were rejected.
"Phenomenal" performance "Livingston" — analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdairs Lamont in Tony Macaroni arena
Phenomenal performance and result of Livingston.
Each of them was fine, continuing to keep their hope alive, constantly improving their performance.
Their game style and personality have practically not changed since returning to the highest echelon, but a great compliment has earned Holts on how he has commissioned the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkets (Halkett) was great in maintaining the pre-organized protection, while Menga was making sure that Connor Goldson and Joe Worral always remained vigilant.
However, "Rangers" lack of inspiration.
No matter how well they were sometimes under Jared, they were far from these standards.
Their last bomb was temporary — only once they entered the farm area — and this is essentially a call to remember "Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is waiting for a shared feeling in kelne
On Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met in breakfast in Berlin, there was a lot of smile and blue sky.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO members.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to the King to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police, as a reason for security, blocked 25 000 people's efforts without allowing them to meet in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of whom were Kurds — also expressed their attitude, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to take it to themselves.
The mutual protests between the two parties reflect the contradictions created by the guest, whose part of the German Turk is considered a hero, but others are nothing like a autocrat.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: the biker dies in a car crash
In Sadrasma, a car in London was killed by a bicycle driver.
Sadursme took place on the Bestwood Street crossing with Evelyn Street, on the road with intensive traffic in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped, and the doctor provided help, but the man died at the scene.
SADURSME took place several months after another biker in the Çailders Street, about a mile from the site of the conflict on Sunday. At that time, the driver left the scene of the conflict.
The Police Department of the capital announced that the police were involved in identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Roads and buses are closed at the site, but drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six employees injured during the accident
The Prison Office (Prison Office) reports that six prison staff were injured in an irregular manner in the hard prison regime of men.
The riots occurred in the "HMP Long Lartin" prison in Vorchester at about 09.30 BST on Sunday and will still continue.
In order to prevent irregularities involving eight prisoners who are confined to one wing, the staff of the special service "Tornado" were involved.
Light facial trauma was treated at the site of the event.
The representative of the prison department said: "In order to resolve the incident in the "HMP Long Lartin" prison, specially trained prison personnel were involved.
Six staff members were provided with medical assistance due to trauma.
We will not be content with violence in our prisons and clearly say that those responsible will be handed over to the police and perhaps spend more time behind the rest."
The "HMP Long Lartin" prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was being treated in a hospital after the arrest of a prisoner.
And in October last year, the workers responsible for the control of dumping were sent to prison to resolve serious irregularities in which the staff had been attacked with billiard bombs.
Orkáns Roza Phoenix, Lasveggas and Soltleuxtia threatens with sudden floods (probably the affected areas of drought will benefit from the situation)
Arizona is rarely suffering from tropical depression, but that is what is likely to happen early next week, when the Orcanine Rosa with the rest of its power moves across the desert south, creating a risk of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden floods in the West of Arizona on Monday and Tuesday, in the south and east of Nevada, in the south-east of California and in the south-east of Jutja, including Phoenix, Flagstafu, Lasvedas and Soltleichtia.
It is expected that Rosa will drive straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving with a case later on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix Twitter indicated that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical wind or depression status in the 200-journey (320 km) radio from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an hurricane of 40 miles (65 km) from the borders of the AZ."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center (National Hurricane Center) predict 2-4 inches (~5,08-10,2 cm) of rainwater, reaching in some places up to 6 inches (15,24 cm).
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the central part of the Klins Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1-2 inches (~2,54-5,08 cm), reaching even 4 inches (~10,2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not at risk of sudden floods, the Roses may become a blessing because the region has been hit by drought.
Although the possibility of landing raises very serious concerns, some rains may benefit because the south-west is now suffering from drought.
According to the US Drought Monitor, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, reported weather.com.
First of all, Orcana Rosa's path leads to Lower California (Baja California) in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Rosa is still with Orkan's force Sunday from the morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km), is about 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Eigenija (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico and is heading north with a speed of 12 miles (19 km) in hour.
The wind meets the warmer waters of the Pacific and is therefore agreed upon.
Therefore, the hurricane is expected to reach the coast in Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
In the part of the rain gas, Mexico can be strong by creating a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the rain gas will reach 3-6 inches (7.62-15.24 cm) from the interior of Lower California in the south-west of Sonora, falling, possibly reaching 10 inches (25.4 cm)," weather.com reported.
Rosa will move north, across Mexico as a tropical wind, and then reach Arizona’s border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then cross Arizona and arrive in the south of Jut’s late evening.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or her remains is very strong rain gas in Lower California, the north-west Sonora and the south-east US," said the National Orkan Center.
It is expected that this rain will lead to life - threatening sudden floods and floods in the wilderness, and earthquakes in the mountainous areas.
Attack Midsummer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20 years of age were arrested in suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16 - year - old boy with a hole in the door.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, about 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition remains stable.
The police reported that 17 years of age and two 18 years of age, as well as 20 years of age, were arrested by night in Redstock, Eivo and Somerset.
The police have called on anyone who could have a mobile phone material for what happened.
Tramps claim that Kaveno has suffered from the "wickness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote on Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the unfair and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramps announced at a meeting in Vilnius, West Virginia.
Tramps stressed that Kaveno has suffered from the "wickness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kaveno pointed out to Congress, where he vigorously and emotionally rejected any Christian Blasey Ford (Christian Blasey Ford) charge of sexual abuse several decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also pointed out his accusations during the hearing.
On Saturday, the president announced that "Americans saw the Cavenian "the excellence, ability and courage".
"The vote on the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote to approve one of the most educated lawyers in our time with a history of serving the people," he announced to the supporters' effort in West Virginia.
President Kaveno mentioned the circumstances when discussing the importance of Republican activities in the interim elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I didn't expect it, but actually I did," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Tramps objected that the Democrats had undertaken a mission "to protest and oppose".
It is expected that the first of the main proceedings of the Senate on the appointment of Caven will take place no later than Friday, the CNN informed the Republican party's senior assistant.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia, and the number of victims is clearly increasing
On Saturday, the officials reported that at least 384 people were killed, many were simply killed when the giant waves came up against the shores after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulaves.
On Friday at the festival in the city of Paul, hundreds of people had gathered on the beach, when up to six meters (18 feet) high waves were pounding across the shore, killing many and killing all who were on their way.
Cunami came out after 7.5 bats of strong earthquakes.
"When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still working on the beach and did not run away immediately, and they became victims," BNPB representative of the Indian Disaster Reduction Agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Sutopo Purwo Nugroho) briefed Jakart.
"Cunami didn't come alone, it brought cars, balloons and buildings, it attracted everything that was on the ground," Nugoro told, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph before crossing the coast).
"Many people scratched the trees to save, and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Paul.
There are many destroyed homes and shops, deformed and destroyed bridges, and a water dedicated mosque in the photographs taken by the disaster agency.
After midnight, the coastal city continued to tremble on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency highlighted in the BPPT Communication that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was approximately 200 times higher than the energy of the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima in World War II.
The location of the city was long, possibly at the end of the narrow alley, increasing the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho's posts were described as "wide" and reported that thousands of houses, hospitals, shops and hotels have been destroyed.
He said that some of the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the ruined buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost.
Nugroho recognized that the number of victims and the accommodation could be larger along the coast line 300 km (190 nautical miles) north of Pala, in the area called Dongala (Dongala), which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications were completely destroyed, information was not received from Dongala," Nugroho informed.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross reported, adding that its personnel and volunteers are going to the affected regions.
"Now it's a tragedy, but everything could have been worse," the organisation said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not being informed that the tsunami had visited Paul, although officials claimed that the waves had arrived at the time of the announcement of the warning.
The video distributed on social networks tells us that a man on the top floor is very cleverly called people on the bottom of the street, approaching the tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall will strike against the shore, removing buildings and machines.
The news agency "Reuters" is unable to immediately confirm whether the material is real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of electropaedic power, which turned off Paul’s communication, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials reported that the army has begun to send cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still need food and other first necessities.
The city airport is open only to aid measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Widodo) was planning to visit Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims of Indonesian tsunamis exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Mr Doseba (Dosebah) said that the World Vision staff who successfully reached the city of Paul from Dongala, and now we have the brunt of the office in the backyard, took a long drive.
"They told us that they saw a lot of buildings that were broken," he explained.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams were very committed to organizing disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid workers were not allowed to go to Paul with great experience.
According to Indonesia's legislation, the financing of foreign organisations, resources and personnel can only take place if the post area is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said the Indonesian Red Cross representative Aulia Ariani (Aulia Arriani).
"When the government announces, "Okay, it is a national disaster," we will be able to accept international aid, but such status has not yet been established."
When Paul arrived on the second night after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members were still not found, hoping that their love would become a miracle that would make life easier during natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was taken out of the stream.
On Sunday, the rescuer released a woman who had been pushed under the rubble for two days next to her mother’s corpse.
Gendon Subandano (Gendon Subandano), a coach of the national team of Indonesian paragliders, had prepared two of the uninvited paragliders in Asia, which took place this month in Indonesia.
Other guests from the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi (Mandagi), were their grandchildren.
"As we experienced the paraglider," he said, "you teach me the burden of emotion."
Mr. Gendona recalled that after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel had been distributed by the paragliding team, he sent the "WhatsApp" reports for hours to the participants of the Palais Competition who participated in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one sign of the mouse, not two marks of the blue.
"Madam, this means that the reports did not reach the addressee," he said.
The coals broke 26 750 dollars while filling the ATM in "Newport on the Levee" complex
According to the Newport Police Department's announcement, on Friday morning, 26 750 dollars was charged to the staff of Brink's, who filled the ATM in the Newport on the Levee complex.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM entertainment complex and had prepared to fill it with more money," said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While the manager was busy, another person "from the back joined the Brink's employee" and robbed the sum of the money intended for the ATM.
According to the press release, the Witnesses observed several suspects who left their crime scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have information about their identities should contact the NYPD 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: the rapper changes its name to Je
Reperis Kanje West changes his name to Ye (Ye).
Speaking of a change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "Boutne, who previously knew as Kanji Vest."
41 years old West was already called Je, and used the name of his eighth album published in June ("Ye").
This change takes place before his appearance in this Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
The composers say that he replaces the singer Arian Grandi, who has stopped the work of "emotional Cause".
Vests has said that it is not only a reduction in his current professional name, but also a religious significance.
"I believe that "Ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "You," West explained earlier this year, discussing its album name with the head of Big Boy (Big Boy).
"Then I am you, I am us, it is us.
At first there was Kanje, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", which is thought of good and bad in ours, about our confusion, about everything.
The album is more concerned about what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, who had previously been known both Puff Daddy and P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the words Love (Love) and Brother Love (Brother Love).
JAY-Z, who had previously cooperated with the West, has, however, not used the thought mark and big letters.
The elected President of Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians during the 50th anniversary of the bloody return to the students.
Lopess Obrador on Saturday "Tlatelolco Plaza" promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, a peaceful demonstration by the army unit was demolished, killing as many as 300 people during the movement of left - handed students throughout Latin America.
Lopess Obadors has vowed to support the new Mexicans in the years, each month giving grants to students and opening up more public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and education put young criminals in the ranks.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains the investor and artistic intellectual practitioner Kai Fu Lee (Kai-Fu Lee), who has worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after various US government bodies have made statements about artificial intelligence, although the US as a whole lacks a strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, last year China launched its plan: it aims to become the main country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The two-fold research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good start, given that all other countries have so far left the United States, and the next cardinal turn in the field of artificial intelligence is expected," Li said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Li said that double funding could double the possibility that the next success in the field of artificial intelligence will be achieved in the USA.
Lī, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month, published "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt" as Executive Director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested funds in one of China's most important intellectual companies "Face+".
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon (Karnegi-Melona) University to create an artistic intelligence system that would blow up the best Othello (Revers ) player in America, but later he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch.
Lī acknowledged the previous technology competition organised by the U.S. government, such as "Defense Advanced Research Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked when to prepare for the future to identify people with ideas about the future.
"Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to obtain government grants," says Lee.
"It is not China that attracts leading scientists, but large companies," he explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have over the last few years paid university awards for the work of artistic intelligence.
Li added that changes in immigration policy could also help the US improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically allocated to people with a degree of philosophy doctor in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the National Council of China published its next generation's artistic intelligence development plan.
It was explained that the National Science Foundation of China provides funding for people from academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
This year, the U.S. Defence Department established a joint art intelligence centre that aims to bring together partners from industrial and academic circles, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artistic intelligence.
And this month DARPA (Central Research and Development Organization of the US Defence Ministry) announced a $2 billion investment in the initiative called "AI Next".
The National Science Fund, on the other hand, is now investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, US legislation, which has been tasked with setting up the National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence (National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence) has not worked for several months.
Macedonians in the referendum on the change in the name of the country
The citizens of Macedonia voted on Sunday in the referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the "North Macedonian Republic" by taking steps to prevent the decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, emphasises that its northern neighbour's name shows claims to its territory and has imposed veto on the accession of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
Both governments have concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but the nationalists in the opposition insist that the changes reflect the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that I will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign with the invitation to boycott has raised concerns about whether the voter activity will reach at least 50%, which is necessary for the referendum to be recognised as valid.
The referendum bulletin asks: "Are you involved in NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev (Zoran Zaev), object that it is the price to be paid on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that arose after the collapse of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation, such as the EU and NATO member.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, in the protection of the European Union, because it means safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgejevska (Oliver Georgievska) in Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have announced that they will take account of the outcome of the vote which will become decisive.
In order to change the name, a majority of 2/3 will be required in Parliament.
The National Elections Commission informed that no violations had been reported by one afternoon.
However, the activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections, in which 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old José Tanevski (Gjose Tanevski), a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zajevs, his wife Zorica (Zorica) and his son, Dusko, gave his vote in his referendum in Macedonia on the change of the name of the country which will open the way to NATO and the European Union in Strumica on 30 September 2018 in Macedonia.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov (Vladimir Kavardarkov), prepared a small audience and made chairs at the tents that had been placed in the referendum boycotts.
"We are about NATO and the EU, but we want to stand up with a raised head, not through the door of service," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a small country, but we have self-respect.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others such as China or Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zajevs argues that NATO will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe most will vote for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zajevs said after the vote.
He said the result "yes" "will confirm our future."
The survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research (Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research) shows that 30 to 43% of the voter will participate in the referendum, less than the necessary activity.
Another survey carried out by Macedonia's Telema TV found that 57 per cent of the vote on Sunday was scheduled to take part.
70 percent of them replied that they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electorate's activity must be 50 per cent and one more vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government that came to power last May.
See: Manchestras "City" Sergio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) wanders through all the "Brightton" protection to get gates
Serhio Agvero and Rahim Sterling (Raheem Sterling) brought the protection of "Brightton" by allowing Manchester's "City" Saturday at the "Etihad" stadium in Manchester, England to win with 2:0.
Agvero was struck by the ease of his gates in 65 minutes.
The Argentinian booster received a boost at the beginning of the combination in the middle of the field.
He broke out between the three Brighton shields and went into the open field.
Then Agvero hugged four green cracks.
He led the bomb to one guard, then the running power of several more at the edge of the "Brightton" field.
Then he made a left-hand plug to reach Sterling.
The English center's shooter used his first touch to play back Agvero, who put a good football tooth in the case to hit the "Brigton" guard Metju Rayen (Mathew Ryan) on the right side of the network.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," the city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked to them about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were glad he got the gates at the time.
But it was Sterling that provided the original advantage of Sky Blues in the Premiery Cup.
The gate was opened in 29 minutes.
Aggero played the ball in the area of Brighton.
He sent a bomb with a beautiful seat along the left leg of Leroy Sane.
There were several sites in the river until Sterling was entrusted with delivering the bomb to the next gate stand.
The Sky Blues centre elevator easily entered the bomb network just before crossing the border.
"City" fights with the "Hoffenheim" Champion League team on Tuesday at 12.55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Zinshaim, Germany.
Shercer wants to get trouble "Rockies"
Since "Nationals" did not participate in the exclusion games, there was no reason to restart.
But Chercers (Scherzer), who is always ready to fight, hopes to use the opportunity against Colorado "Rockies", but only if "Rockies" will be the current exclusion games. And "Rockies" in the Group of the National League of the West is led by one game against Los Angeles-based "Dodgers".
"Rockies" has printed at least a white card with Friday evening with 5:2 winning "Nationals", but still has not earned its first title in the division.
"Even if we play the same thing, we will at least be able to enjoy knowing that the air here, in Denver, with the effort and second team, will probably be the most intense I'll ever meet this year.
And why would I not want to fight then?"
"Nationals" have not yet announced which Sunday will start the game, but, as the news says, is ready to allow Shercer to make an anniversary.
Chercers, who will be at the beginning of 34th, took the annual session on Thursday in the "bullpen" part of the outdoors, and on Sunday the usual holiday will throw the bomb.
The Washington labrocis is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 sharps 220 2/3 inches this season.
Tramps are making myths in West Virginia
The president mentioned the situation in which his elected High Court candidate Brets Kaveno was involved, while discussing the importance of the activities of Republican voters in the interim election.
"In November everything we have done is threatened.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It's really very, very serious — I didn't expect it, but I did, and that's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates," he said.
Tramps continued: "You see this horrible, horrible group of radicals democrats who are acting right now.
And they have committed themselves to regain power by using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see the evil, the opposite action.
They have the same thing as they do, they have to break to gain power and control, that's why they want power and control, and we won't do it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have undertaken a mission "to protest and oppose".
"But you have seen the same thing in the last four days," he stressed, calling the Democrats "wicked, wicked, disobedient and false".
He called on the Senate Judicial Committee Senate Senator Dianne Feinstein (Dianne Feinstein), to which the audience responded with loud calls.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you lost the document?
Hmm, what's this about?
No, hmm, wait – it was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It's unbearable to the open.
It was no wonder that Momentum activists in my local party wanted me to submit to censorship.
Finally, I am the last member of the Parliament of the Libyan Party to date who has been informed that he is not willing to do so, because we do not hide our opinion.
My fellow Members in parliament, Joan Ryan, were walking in a similar way because she was determined to stand up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not accepting Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of an economically responsible policy, of national security, of Europe, is ironic, but they were issues in which Jeremiah did not agree with the previous leaders.
The announcement on the leiborist meeting in the part east of Nottingema said Friday that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of my local Lebanese MP were exactly that.
Unfortunately, at many meetings today, air is different and promises of a "better, safer" policy have been forgotten long ago, if ever.
It has become increasingly clear that the Leiborist party does not want to have different views, and any opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party.
This began shortly after Jeremiah became the leader: colleagues, whom I think our political views are similar, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept the views I would never otherwise have agreed on – whether it is national security or the single EU market.
When I speak in public — and it is not really important what I say — I follow a study on the use of social networks, calling for a ban on candidates for the next election by reshaping the centre’s policy, claiming that I have no place in the Leiborist party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more successful than some of my colleagues, because the comments I have made are usually political.
I was amazed at the professionalism and commitment of my colleagues, who have every day been confronted with the currents of sexist and racist insults, but never hesitated to avoid them.
One of the most dissatisfying aspects of this political era is how normal use has become.
Last week, Jeremiah Korbin announced that the Leiborist party should explore a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organisation that is ready for diversity of views and with every expression of distrust or change of the rules of choice, the party will collapse.
Over the last two years, I've often been given advice not to go to class, think about what I'm talking about, and then with me "everything will be fine."
But that is not why I have decided to take part in politics.
Since I joined the leiborists back 32 years as a student, responding to the failure of the Techeres government, which had literally led my integrated school class to collapse, I have been tasked with fighting for better public services for those who are most needed — both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never concealed my political views, nor the previous elections.
There was no reason in the East to doubt my position on policy issues and in areas where I did not agree with the existing government.
To those who put forward a proposal Friday, I can only say that at a time when the state is determined to move to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Leiborist party.
But essentially the only thing I want to announce is not the Momentum of Notingema, but to their voters whether they are leiborist members: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I affirm that there is no threat of a ban on running or reminders that no one in politics will be able to stop me from doing what I think is best for you all.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unquoted "Ayr" reaches the highest range table
The last two attempts could be to some extent met with the final outcome, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting Scottish championship match today.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only unspoken team of ten.
Finally, it was their great protection and the use of much better opportunities that led the owners, and coach Peter Murchie has all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in all our games and we are still not killed, so I have to rejoice," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Kristius (Robyn Christie): "All respect "Ayr", they used their advantages better than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Frazier Klimo (Frazier Climo) highlighted "Ayr", but the yellow card of Scottish captain Rory Hughes, where the "Warriers" was awarded, changed the figures of "Melrose", and Jason Baggot (Jason Baggot) held an unrealized bomb.
The climate increased the management of "Ayr" with punishment, just at the end of the half-life, he won points, then realized a solo attempt, and thus stopped "Ayr" with 17-5.
However, the half-life of Melrose began with a good game, and Patrick Anderson (Patric Anderson)’s attempt to achieve Begot reduced back to 5 points.
Then there was a long pause, as Ruurid Knott was severely injured and was taken to bars away from the field, but when the game began "Ayr" quickly turned forward when Staford Macdovels (Stafford McDowall) made an attempt to make Klimo.
The existing captain, Blair Macpherson, then received the yellow card, and again, after intense pressure, Melrose used the remaining player — with Bruce Colvine, which was not realized.
However, the owners quarreled, and when Struan Hachinson (Struan Hutchinson) received the yellow card for crossing the Climo without a bomb, from the penalty corridor, Makferson made a trip to the rear of the "Ayr" mill.
As in the past, it was almost from the very beginning that Kyle Rowe took over David Armstrong's winning field and sent a flag player, Gregor Henry, to the fifth attempt of the owners.
"Still Game" star seems to plan a new career in a business restaurant
The Ford Kieran (Ford Kieran) star of the "Still Game" series appears to be planning to take part in the hospitality business, as it was discovered that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis is playing at the popular BBC show he is making, with his old partners playing with Greg Hemhill.
The duets have announced that the next nine season will be the last one, and Kirnan obviously plans his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the "Scottish Sun" source pointed out that Kirnan was planning to participate in the Glázgow's "walking restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us!": the land-based Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol around the bays of the armed fleet of the State of Lapas.
Public buildings have raised the green flags of the ocean.
Fleet base ships from Lake Titicaca, to Amazon, are decorated with a motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In the land of Bolivia, the memory of Chile in the bloody 19th century conflict on the lost coast line is still alive, just as it has been in the Pacific for a long time.
This hope is possible for the highest number of years since Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice on 1 October following a five-year review.
"Bolivia is developing, in its spirit it is united and peaceful, and, of course, with positive thoughts, the outcome is expected," said Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Kalzadilla (Roberto Calzadilla).
Many residents will see the International Court of Justice’s judgement on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide for the benefit of Bolivia’s claim that, after several decades of negotiations with interruptions, Chile is obliged to discuss the sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
President Evo Morales (Evo Morales) of Bolivia's charismatic local origin, who is waiting for the fight to be postponed next year, is also very interested in the Monday's judgment.
"We are close to regaining the Pacific," he was excited at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that Bolivia’s judgment of good is unlikely and, even if it is adopted, there are no major changes to be expected.
In the Netherlands, the United Nations based body does not have the power to grant the territory of Chile, and its representatives have said that the outcome of the negotiations will not be determined.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's judgment is taken no more than six months after the final examination shows that the case was "not complicated", explained international legislator Paza Zarate (Paz Zárate) from Chile.
And the last four years of Bolivia have not moved forward, but, rather, have slowed down.
"The issue of access to the sea has been addressed by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morale’s military rhetoric has blinded the rest of the good will, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to hold the discussion.
The two countries have not exchanged consignments since 1962.
The Bolivian representative in The Hague, who was once President Edward Rodríguez Veltz, did not agree that the court had made an unusually rapid decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "add paragraph 139 years of conflict from which both sides will get," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used sea problems as political hooks.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to question what to do to overcome the past."
North Korea will refuse nuclear weapons only when you can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) said his people would never be the first to eliminate their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises expressed at the meeting of the leaders of both countries at the time of Singapore.
His comments were made at the time when it appears that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Mike Pompeo) is ready to resume diplomatic measures to prevent nuclear failure, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korean leaders, Kim Čennus.
Ri claims that they are "fights" to hope that the United States still unresolved sanctions and unwillingness to declare the end of the Korean war will ever get North Korea on its way.
Washington is careful with regard to the declaration of consent before Phenjana will take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trumps want a second meeting.
But many are skeptical about whether Phenjana really wants to give up the weapon, which the country is probably the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenjan next month to prepare the next Kim meeting with Trump.
Paris fashions show this with the latest massive headline on the way to you nearest High Street
If you want to increase your skull collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Tom Browne presented viewers with a series of absurd, huge head-covered items in the spring/summer season 2019 collection, which huddled on the Paris Fashion Week-style background.
This summer's highly unpracticable hats have flooded Instagram, and these designers have sent their amazing achievements to demonstrate fashion.
Valentino’s most outstanding performance was a beautiful purple hat carved with a colour similar to a wide border that wrapped its heads.
In the middle of the massive accessories were gemstones, magic hats, and even pineapple — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed off a strange mask — right before Helovine.
Many of the dyed masks were white lips, and they were soon added to Hanibal Lekter, not to high - fashion.
One of the structures recalled the breath of the pantry, with tubes and glasses, while the other resembled the tasteful cone.
And if you want to continue in massive fashion, then the time has come.
Style observers believe that huge bees may be on your way to the nearest High Street.
The large hats became popular immediately after the appearance of "La Bomba" — the shoulder hats with two feet (~60 cm) wide on each side seem to have worn all, from Rianna, to Emili Ratajovski (Emily Ratajkovski).
The status of very impractical hats as cult objects in all social networks has led to yet another major act on the clay — the salt beach som, almost as large as the swimwear model that wears it.
The red-haired yellow-haired aphrodisiac sum, treated with African barges and equipped with white leather gloves, took place in the spring/feast season 2019 collection of the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Lukke Armitage explained FEMAIL: "I expect large sums of hats and beaches to appear in the central street shops next summer, because the designer has left such a big impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for hugely sized accessories."
John Edwards: Language knowledge is essential for the world’s citizens
Scottish independent schools have an excellent reputation for educational institutions, and it has retained it in 2018 when excellent exam results were obtained on a regular basis, which further enhances individual and collective achievements in sports, art and other public events.
The aim of this school, which is attended by a total of 30,000 pupils in Scotland, is to provide the best level for their grandchildren and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their grandchildren for further and higher education, their chosen career and their life as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can develop and implement specific school programmes, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to people in the language that he understands, it will remain in his mind.
If you speak his native language, it will remain in his heart."
This is a convincing reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to establish relationships and gain confidence in people from other countries.
Given the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league table with the largest number of exams held in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign - language students reached the highest level.
Scottish Independent Schools Council data for 74 schools show that 72 percent of the students received the highest score in Chinese A, and 72 percent gained the same score, 69 percent, and 63 percent, respectively, in German.
This shows that the support of independent schools in Scotland is foreign as vitally important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages, as an object of choice, are evaluated in independent school programmes as high as the objects of a group of science-technology-engineering and mathematics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
In 2014, the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of the employer as a reason for the failure to complete the vacancy mentioned a lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills become more and more mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
In increasing job opportunities where language skills will be needed, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of their chosen career, learning a foreign language will bring them real benefits in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a number of languages.
According to a 2013 YouTube survey involving more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent did not understand foreign language well enough to maintain negotiations, but French was the only language that spoke two-digit numbers of people, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for modern - day children to learn the language of their contributions.
A number of languages, especially the language skills of developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in language.
Part of the school will focus more on the most common languages of the day, while other languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for the future of Britain, will be taught in accordance with the plans by 2020.
No matter what interests your child, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be experts in the area.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and will provide them with the skills needed to achieve success in the future.
At present, in the global business environment, languages cannot be denied that they are still vital to the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages would be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer young Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It must be done well (It must).
John Edwards is Director of the Scottish Independent School Council
Lebron's debut in "Lakers" made up of Sunday Sandjego
Fani has finally waited for the moment when Lebron's first game will take place in the composition of Los Angeles Lakers.
Lukke Walton, coach of Lakers, has announced that James will be playing on Sunday's preseason opening game against Denver's "Nuggets" Sandjego.
However, it is still necessary to determine exactly how much time he will play.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Volton reported on the official website of Lakers.
"Lakers" reporter Mike Trudell on Twitter reported that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
Continuing the practice this week, James asked about his plans regarding the series of six pre-season games by Lakers.
"At this stage of my career I don't need preseason games to prepare," he said.
Trampa myth in West Virginia Time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trumps is starting a series of myths today in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five villages planned for Trampla next week, including stopping in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on his choice to fill the free space in the Supreme Court has been suspended, the purpose of Trump is to obtain support for the forthcoming elections, as there is a risk that the Republicans will lose control of Congress after the vote was taken in November.
What is going to happen today in Trump’s West Virginia, and how can you view it online?
Trampa residence in Vilnius, West Virginia is scheduled for seven evenings, after ET today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Tramps of myths in West Virginia You can watch online via YouTube.
Tramps is supposed to be talking about hearing this week in Breta Kaveno, the Supreme Court candidate, who has committed sexual harassment on the grounds of urgency, and the Senate's voting is expected to delay approval for a week while the FBI is conducting an investigation.
However, the main objective of this site is to help improve the situation for the Republicans expected to be elected in November.
Therefore, the campaign of President Trampa shows that this next week's five myths are "to activate volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they own in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control for his agenda is so important that the president will visit the state as much as possible because we are starting a working campaign season," Trampa campaign representative, who did not want to reveal his name, told Reuters.
This evening's home, which is planned to be "Wesbanco Arena" in Vilnius, will be able to connect supporters from "Ohaio and Pennsylvania, and will be reflected in Pittsburgh's media," says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Tramps is trying to help the candidate Patrick Morrisey, a senator of the West Virginia Senate, who remains in line with the polls.
"It's not a good sign to Morise that the president has to come to help improve his results in the polls," said Simon Haeder, professor of politics at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Radio Battle 2018: The United States has demonstrated its commitment to fighting to keep high hopes for Sunday games
After three sessions in "one word" the afternoon game in the form of "foursome" was possible exactly what is needed for this Raider cup.
Sportsmen love to talk about success fluctuations, and they truly believe in it, especially in competitions such as these.
So, which side do they think is a success now?
"They were in charge with six points, but now with four, as I think it means in its sense that success has turned towards us," said Jordan Spyts (Jordan Speeth).
Europe, of course, is preferred because it is in the lead of 4 points, but 12 more will be played.
Spyt explained that the Americans believe that the wind blows at them and they have reason to optimism, of course, also in Spyta and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can boast with three points out of four.
Spite has been destructive from the first seat to the hall, and is an example of the winner.
Those guitarist bells became louder as his rounds went on, the decisive sitin was made in the courtroom to reach the same number of seats four times when he and Thomas had left for two seats after two.
His sitin in the morning, which won his victory 15 , was perceived with a similar bell, of them, for his conviction that the American team has not yet been expelled.
"And really have to smoke deep, and worry about your sword," Spitt said.
That's all that's left to these players.
18 minutes to make a success.
The only players who have won more points in the last two days than Spyts and Thomas are French Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Raider War.
Europe's strange but attractive couple are left behind by four points and will not be able to hurt.
Molivud was the only couple who went out on Saturday afternoon without bogies, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and in the last nine mornings on Friday mornings.
This move and the way their energy flows into this frustrating effort and back it confirms that they are the players to win Sunday, and Fleetwood with Molinari will be the most popular players who can ensure a potential European victory when the sun goes through Le Golf National.
At the same time, I would like to meet both of you in different quarters.
However, the talks about the European triumph were premature.
Babba Vatson (Bubba Watson) and Webb Simpson (Webb Simpson) quickly ended up with this morning's fourball hero Sergio Garcia (Sergio Garcia), who played with Alex Noren.
Bogius and the two double front nine brought Spain and Sweden into the chain, and they were not even close to cultivating it.
But there is no one on Sunday to help us get through it.
The games in fourball and foursome formats are so exciting to watch in close proximity because of the interaction, to see what advice they give and what they do not, and how the strategy can change the situation in the future.
Europe has so far played better as a team, and before the last few days it is in the middle of a long run, but this foursome game has shown that the US team is committed to fighting for which many, especially the Stateside, have doubted.
European Selection for the last day of the Raider case is under control 10-6
The European elections will start on the last day of the Raider Cup in a pleasant run after Saturday's fourball and foursome competition ended with 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari were in charge of two victories over the heavy-working Taiger Woods (Tiger Woods), which increased the number of Le Golf National.
Tomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) European team to preserve the trophies lost by Hazeltine two years ago dominated the inaccurate American team in the morning in the form of fourballs, and the result of the series became 3-1.
The U.S. was more energetic in the form of foursomes, winning two cats, but unable to eliminate the deficit.
The Jim Farika (Jim Furyk) team needs 8 points on Sunday 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European year that won four points in a row with Molinar, to be nominated for Mollivud ("Molliwood") after a sensational weekend is only a second few in the history of the Raider Cup, which won four points in the first four matches.
In the form of "fourballs" in Patrick Reed, they then beat Braison Deshambo (Bryson Dechambeau) with a more sensitive result of 5&4.
The Woods, which held two games on Saturday, presented a great game for moments, but he lost 19 of the 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, as well as seven in a row.
Justin Rose retired before morning's games "fourballs", returned to partner Henrik Stenson "foursomes" to say with 2+1 Dastin Johnson and Bruce Kepk (Brooks Koepka), which takes the first and second place in the world ranking.
Europe has failed to achieve its full potential, although the day in the south-west of Paris was a pleasant and breathable wind.
The three-time winner of the prestigious golf competition Jordan Spytts and Justin Tomas set the standard American with two points on Saturday.
They printed 2&1 against the Spanish John Ram (Jon Rahm) and Ian Poulter (Ian Poulter) in fourballs and returned later to call polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 "foursomes" after losing the first two bets.
Only two times in the history of the Raider Cup team has played 4 points in the missing single game, but as owners, the Farika (Furyk) team is only enough with an unresolved result to preserve the trophy.
After being in the second place two days, it seems, the attack on Sunday will be problematic.
North Korea announced that in "no" would be unarmed unilaterally, without confidence
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions had deepened its mistrust towards the United States, and North Korea would never, in such a situation, unilaterally refuse its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) informed the World's Annual General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea has taken "significant steps of good will", such as the cessation of nuclear weapons and rocket tests, the dismantling of nuclear weapons tests and the promise never to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate US response," he said.
"If there is no confidence in the US, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will never be the first to unravel unilaterally."
Although Ri repeated well-known North Korean superstitions about Washington's opposition to the "stepping" approach to denouncing, according to which Korea would be compensated for the steps taken, his statement left the impression because it did not automatically reject unilateral denouncing, as Phenjana had done before.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Čenun and Donald Trampa, the first US President and North Korean leader, at a meeting in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work to achieve the "Denomination of the Korean peninsula" but Tramps promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has officially tried to end the Korean War from 1950 to 53, but the United States has announced that Phenjan must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also failed to accept the call to facilitate serious international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The ASV insists that "denomination must be first", and increases the level of pressure created by the sanctions to achieve the goal of power, even in opposition to "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions could force us on our way is empty fantasies that people are gloating about us who don't know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our distrust."
Ri did not discuss the intentions of the second meeting of Kim once with Trampu, whose leader in the United Nations had specifically mentioned in the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the Minister specifically instituted three meetings with South Korea leader Munu Jae (Moon Jae-in) over the past five months and added: "If the other party had been South Korea on this denouncing issue rather than the United States, the denouncing of the Korean peninsula would not have come on such a road."
However, Ri’s tone of speech was dramatically different from last year’s statement when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the designation of North Korean missiles on the continental part of the United States is inevitable after the Lunas President Tramps had called Kim on the mission of the "rocketman".
This year, the United Nations Tramps, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still much to be done, and the sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Wednesday Trump announced that he did not plan a specific time, stressing that "not important, or it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should pay the Phenjana for its achievements.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Council's sanctions must be maintained vigorously, without allowing errors until final and convincing denouncing has been achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced the sanctions since 2006 in an effort to cut the funding of the Phenjan nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly, and then informed that he would visit Phenjan again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not successful.
He left Phenjana in July, saying that progress has been made, but after a few hours North Korea accused him of "gagster's respectable requirements".
North Korea's meeting with Muna was committed this month to dismantle a weapon polygon and also a nuclear complex if the US is to take "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed her that "appropriate measures", which North Korea wants to see, are security guarantees that Tramps promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard University will learn the subject of how to get sufficient rest
The new subject of education at Harvard University this year has become that students are sleeping more, and it is an attempt to turn against the increasingly popular culture of brutalism, which includes the over-filled study of caffeine for nights.
One speaker found that in the world the best students in the university often have no basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a teaching subject that he considers to be the first subject of such a type of teaching in the United States.
The inspiration to create a new subject of teaching came from his speech on the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
"A girl came to me and said, "Why is it telling me just now that I'm in the last class?"
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
This year, for the first time in the course of the course, provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits promote achievement in education and sport and improve overall well-being.
Paul Bareira (Paul Barreira), professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of University Health Services, informed that the university decided to take a course after learning that students suffer from severe sleeplessness during the week.
In the course of the training of hours, the series of interactive tasks shall be included.
One of the parts is a picture of co-dwelling doors where students click on coffee bags, curtains, sports baskets and books to learn about the effect of caffeine and light and how performance affects the lack of sleep in sport and how important the sleep routine is.
In another part, students will be informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the student city map with interactive icons invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how health will affect cigarette smoking," added Professor Cheisler.
He said that a culture that boasts the ability to learn all night still exists, and added that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students meant that the lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that sufficient quality sleep must be the student's "blind weapon" to combat stress, stress and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, as the lack of sleep can be turned over into a hunger mode, making them hungry.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old Californiar who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to develop a course after attending one of his professor's lectures last year, in Harvard’s first course.
He said that the subject of the study had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to all students.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for students who receive postgraduate education to learn a similar programme before going to enjoy competition.
Professor Cheisler advises students to install a moderator not only for the time they get up, but also when they go to sleep, as well as to keep in mind how people damage the "green lights" that the electronic devices display and LED lamps, as they can break daily rhythms by making sleep difficult.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Men's gates are surrounded by Gerard's viruses
"Rangers" was looking for another sad game in the guests when Dolly Menga's website, Steven Gerarda (Steven Gerrard's fallen team decision 1 - 0 for the loss of Livingston.
The "Ibrox" team was hoping to win the first victory since February 4:1 in St. Johnstone, but the Gerija Holt (Gary Holt) team won his second loss in 18 games, since he became the club manager, and his team is at 8 points away from the Scottish championship leader "Hearts".
Menga entered the bomb doors seven minutes before the end of the half-time, and the lack of the "Rangers" inspiration did not look anything after trying to balance the result.
"Rangers" fall to the sixth place, while "Livingston" rises to the third, and in terms of gate difference it can only be overcome by "Hibernian".
And "Rangers" could be another problem because a judge's assistant Calum Spensam (Calum Spence) needed medical attention due to a head trauma, which was apparently caused by the next end of the bridge.
Gerard made eight changes in his team, which quickly left behind the back of "Ayr", reaching the Betfred case semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same "Livingston" 11 players, who took one point "Hearts" last week, and he would be pleased to see how his well-bred team printed opponents at each episode.
The Rangers may have managed the bomb more often, but Livingston made better use of what they did.
They had to get the gates two minutes after Menga's first game sent Scott Pittman (Scott Pittman) to Alan McGregor's (Allan McGregor) gate, but the center player has long given up his great opportunity.
At that time, the far-off of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner, Alan Litgov, was able to launch a bomb just for a long time behind bars.
"Rangers" took control, but there was an impression that the last third is expected to be played, not believed it will happen.
Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) undoubtedly felt that he had to take a penalty seat in 15 minutes after he had met Steven Loles (Steven Lawless), but Judge Steven Thompson (Steven Thomson) rejected the Colombian invitation.
"Rangers" performed only two sites in the first half, but the former "Ibrox" guard Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly) was not particularly disturbed by the end of the attack of Lassana Kulibali (Lassana Coulibally) with the head, not the true Ovi Edžaria (Ovie Ejaria).
Although "Livingston" started in 34 minutes may have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they had already earned it for their efforts.
"Rangers" was no longer at the end of Jacob's long combination.
Scott Erfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher broadcast a bomb to Scott Robinson, who maintained balance and chose Meng for a simple end.
Gerards stopped Kulibali and replaced Rayin Kent (Ryan Kent), and it almost immediately affected the game, as the semi-guard sent the bomb Morelos, but the impressive Kelly from her line was about to block immediately.
But Livingston continued to let guests play as they liked, Lithuania and Halket doing one long sit-in after another.
The Holta team could have continued the lead at the final stage, but Makgregor played well, stopping Jacobs before Lithuania took a chair with its head from the corner.
"Rangers" replacement Glens Midleton (Glenn Middleton) later requested another sentence, after meeting Jacobs, but tomson's request was ignored again.
Almanahs: Geigera's inventor
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day John Williams Hans Geiger was born in Germany, who grew up as a physicist.
Geigers developed a method for the determination and measurement of radioactivity, as a result, in the end, was a device known as Geigera's numerator.
In science, the host and retained Geiger has also taken his place in pop culture, such as in a 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" (Koronado calls), where the main roles played out unmistakably by cowboy scientists Rogers and Deil Evans:
The man said, "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "This is Geigera's numerator used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these ears on, you can hear how atoms work, which are emitted because of the radiation generated by this mineral."
Evans: "Really, it's really a bird!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the idea that he calls himself “the god of this system of things ” continues to exist.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells and kill them
In the course of vaccine therapy, the immune system is used to detect the bad cells
Using this method, immune system cells that are converted to a laboratory are obtained from the patient
Then they could "see" the protein that is characteristic of many malignant tumours and will be injected back into the body
The test vaccine presents many positive results in patients with different types of malignant tumours.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize bad cells experienced her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is to obtain from the patient's immune system cell by transforming it into a laboratory to be able to "monitor" several tumour-like proteins HER2 and then inject these cells back into the body.
U.S. National Cancer Institute (US National Cancer Institute) in Betesd (Bethesda), Maryland Professor Jay Berzovsky (Jay Berzofsky) reported: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promots the growth of several types of malignant tumours," including breast, ovaries, lungs and intestine cancer, explained Professor Berzovskis.
A similar approach has been observed when the patient receives immune system cells that "learn" how to attack malignant tumour cells in one type of leukaemia.
Kanje West after visiting SNL, clothing in MAGA hat, attacked trampa critics.
It didn't end well
In the course of the Saturday Night Live show, the West was held in Kanje, following an independent chairmanship in which he celebrated US President Donald Tramp and announced that he was candidates for the 2020 President's election.
At the end of the song last night, which was called "Ghost Town", during which he wore the hats "Make America Great", he began to bluff up the sound phrases about the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trampam.
"Just many times when I talk to white people, they ask, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I were interested in racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a sermon with Matt Damon in the main role, in which the Hollywood Star challenged the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Judicial Committee on the charge of Christian Blasey Ford.
Although this has not been transmitted, a comic book by Chris Rock (Chris Rock) was loaded with Vesta’s favorite social networks.
It's not clear if Rock tried to get married like this.
And yet Vest was jealous of the visitors because they had behaved badly against them because of his headache.
"They laughed at me in the back!
They said, "Don't go out with that hat in your head!"
They made fun of me!
And they also said that I've lost the connection to reality," West said, according to Washington Examiner.
The Vest continued: "Do you want to see what happens when you lose the connection to reality?" and promised to draw "your Superman's hug," because that means that you can't tell me what to do with me.
Try to love!"
"Variety" reported that his comments caused disturbances of viewers at least twice, but the members of the team looked saulsy, and at least one person told the press: "The studio was in complete silence."
The wedding had recently been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who had died a few days ago by a friend of the Mac Miller’s rapper.
Vests raped many with a song (I Love it), which he performed in a champagne bottle suit.
The wedding was supported by the conservative TPUSA leader, Kandance Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most powerful people: PATEICOS, WHAT ANOTHER!"
However, on Twitter, the director of the show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was what he was, and it's wonderful."
"But I choose not to hire a person (by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his "art") who, as I think, supports and cares for an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we," she added.
Before this show's reprisal on Twitter, he announced that he has changed his name by saying that he has now become "a being known as Kanji Vesta".
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he acts like Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was before Snoop Lion, and, of course, the unsub's legend Prince, replaced his name with a symbol, but then on "the stage artist who was once known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was killed at a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
Police reported that the incident occurred in Balihakamore (Ballyhakamore).
It is expected that the accused will be brought before the Court of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
"Tron games" star Kits Herrington's turning against toxic manhood
Another Herrington is known as the tooth hunter John Snow HBO in the ugly medieval fantasy series "Tron games".
However, a 31-year-old actor has turned against a brutal hero’s stereotype, saying that such characters on the screen often make young boys think they have to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Kits explained that he thought he had "received the problem", and asked how to deal with the toxic manhood in #MeToo era.
Another who recently got married to his "Tronus Games" partner Rose Leslie (Rose Leslie), also 31 years of age, admitted that he felt that this problem was important to him.
"I can't think right now about what mistakes we've made with manhood," he said.
"What do we teach young men in this aspect of the problem when they grow up in view of the present problem?"
Others believe that television with its very male characters may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic manhood.
He continued, "What is born, but what is taught?
What is taught in TV and in the streets that make young boys feel that they need to be perceived as men?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time: how can we change it?
Because with young men there are clearly problems."
In the interview he also acknowledged that he would not participate in any "Tron Games" continuation or prefabricated after the series ends next summer, stressing that "the fighting fields and horses are abstinent".
Starting in November, Kits will play a key role in the renewed Sam Schepard True West, which is a story about film producer and his brother's kidnapper.
The actor recently admitted that he considered his meeting with his wife Rosa as the best thing that happened to her as a result of the "Tronus Games".
"I met my wife in this, as it in its sense provided my present family and my life from that moment on," he said.
Rosa Emmy won the fantasy series Next character John Snow's Loved Games.
In June 2018, a few went to the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has risen rapidly by 14%.
Health care officials report that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of gender change.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, the Chinese health care officials reported at the conference in the province of June.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000 per year.
The transmission of HIV as a result of gender is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized in 1997, but LGBT is said to be often seen as discrimination against people.
Based on national conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised the availability of general HIV medicines as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxine Votersa denies that the employee has leaked the data of the Republican senators, they turn to "dangerous lies" and "consistency theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. House of Representatives Maxine Waters rejected claims that her staff member had published personal information from three US senators on the Wikipedia legislators' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat argued that claims were spread by the "ultra good" flyers and Internet sites.
"Mells, lies and even more negative lies," Twitter posted on his website.
It is reported that the leaked information includes the addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hečam from Juts.
Information online appeared Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from Congress, at the time of the hearing in the Senate panel on Breta Caveno's sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court.
The flood occurred some time after the three senators questioned Caveno.
Conservative, Internet sites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records is related to the Voters office, and revealed information about the Voters staff staff, Hills reported.
"This unwarranted claim is absolutely false and completely false!" said Voters.
"My staff member whose identity, personal information and security are compromised by this fraudulent and false claim is in no way responsible for the leak of information.
This unwarranted claim is absolutely false and completely false!"
Votters' statement soon sparked criticism online, including the criticism of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer (Ari Fleischer).
"This is an angry denial," Flesher wrote.
"It leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not correspond to the Congressman.
When a person is accused of what he has not done, he must not be angry.
He must not be a soldier.
He must not speak of the accused’s motives.
He must have peace and a frame."
Fleissera's task was to compare the Votersa's reaction to the democratic fall of Judge Kaveno, who was accused of an excessive reaction during the Thursday hearing.
Omars Navarro (Omar Navarro), a Republican candidate, who is running to get Votersa to lose her chair at the middle of the election, also said his thoughts on Twitter.
"Excellently, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Votersa reported that her cabinets had warned responsible officials and law enforcement bodies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the guilty will be found," she continued, "and that they will be legally held responsible for all their works that are destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
John English 3 — Rovana Atkinson’s exhibition on mirror films left in the middle
It has become common to search for association with Brexit in every new film with a British taste, and this seems also to apply to what has been revived, the French edition of Johnny English (Johnny English), which began in 2003 with "John England" and was born in 2011 with "John English Returns".
Is there a new export option for our nation?
In any case, the unqualified Johnny Anglim with the selected eyes and unusually moving face is the right to create a spark after the second resurrection — his name is more than any other signal that he is a broad spectrum comic character designed for areas where consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, this foolish secret agent, who, despite his strange claims of obscurity, is a little Kluzo, a little Mr. Bins, and a little boy of his who plays one novel in the 2012 opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London's "Chariots of Fire" theme.
He is also based on the traveler and the international, unmistakable character that Atkinson once pictured in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV advertisements, where he left chaos on his way.
The latest Johnny Angle experience has at least one or two beautiful moments.
I liked the place where Johnny Anglis goes on a helicopter suit in the middle of a gun suit, and propeller blades are turning against his skull for a while.
The ability of the rekinson to create a visual visual impression is very visible, but the humor is quite weak and strange surface, especially because the "serious" cinema brand, such as "007" and "Impossible Mission" itself, with confidence, uses a comedy as one of the ingredients.
Humor creates the impression that it is dedicated to children rather than adults, and in my opinion Johnny Angle's absurd remains are not as creative and objective as Atkinson's meme film tricks Bina's skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain has become a serious mess.
Cyberhacker has entered the British super-blind Internet network, discovering the identity of British agents in all these areas, as a disfavorable active agent, a pitiably small role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last psalm for the Prime Minister, the Pomposium and conflict-based person who has already lost full political popularity: Emma Tomson does what he can, with Teresa Mejai in part, but in the scenario there is not much to work with.
In the field of research, her advisors inform that since all the active pressures have been discovered, she will have to call on someone who has retired.
And this man is an unscrupulous Johnny Anglis, who now works as a teacher in a fine educational institution, and we learn how to work as a secret agent (a couple of friendly jockeys), because Anglis offers to learn the spy profession from the very foundations.
The English is returned to the extraordinary meeting of Vihihol and is combined with his once many injured assistant Bo, also playing Ben Miller (Ben Miller).
Because now a man has been hired, hired by a submarine commander, a sensitive person who becomes important only at the end of the movie — a role that Vicki Pepperdain (Vicki Pepperdine) has not been fully used.
And so, with Robin's huge mistake in serving her in her secret Highness service, Batman returned and met the beautiful latent woman of Ophelia Bouletova, named Olga Kirylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister has been a dangerously rented charismatic technology billionaire, the evil Jason Volt, whose image is Jack Lewis (Jake Lacy), and he claims to be able to solve the British computer network.
Anglis and Bo start their bickering sensation: they masked themselves as officers, they burn a fine French restaurant; they create the confusion of entering Volta luxury yachts; and Anglis causes absolute chaos, trying to use virtual realities on the head display to get to know the interior of the Volta building.
It is done as much as possible at the end, but, to the extent that the movie is attractive and funny, it has a lot of children’s television elements.
A lot of measured elements.
Like the other Johnny England movies, I can't believe that the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would fully use his talent?
The Leiborist Party rejects plans that the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days
Jeremy Corbina (Jeremy Corbyn) The Leiborist Party is preparing to discuss a radical plan according to which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary of five.
It has been reported that the party wants the company's leaders to grant workers, with the help of the artificial intelligence revolution, to allow them another holiday.
In that case, employees will be able to enjoy the end of three days of the week while receiving the same large salary as before.
Avoti tells us that the idea will "response" the party's agenda in the economy and plans to change the economy for those who work well.
The four-day shift has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which considers it to be an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic change.
One of the highest-ranking representatives of the Leiborist Party reported "The Sunday Times": "It is expected that policy changes will be announced by the end of this year.
"It won't happen one day, but four days of work is an idea that matches the party's goal of balancing the economy for good workers, as well as the overall strategy of the party in industry."
The Leiborist Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party has already promised four days of work in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Leiborist Party, as it is now, does not support these hungers.
The representative of the Leiborist Party reported: "The four-day work week is not part of the party's policy, and the party does not consider it."
The Finnish Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used the Leiborist Conference last week to give a tour of his vision of the socialist revolution economy.
Mr Makdonela explained that he had committed himself to withdrawing the power "to the masses of directors" and the public service company "to speculators".
The Minister of Denmark's Cabinet plans also means that existing average shareholders in water companies may not recover all their packages, as the Lebanese government could implement the "debt" due to the injustices allowed.
He also approved plans to include working companies in the governments and set up the Ownship Funds to allocate 10% of the private sector company's capital to employees who would receive up to 500 pounds each year in dividends.
Lindsey Grems and John Kennedy answer "60 minutes", or FIB investigation into the Kaveno case could change their opinion
The investigation of the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question of whether the Office's findings could cause a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, a 60-minute radio correspondent, Scott Pelley, interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could find out something that would allow them to change their mind.
Kennedy left the impression of a person more obvious than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, in the course of the hearing procedure, that I spoke to Judge Kaveno.
I called him after it happened when the charge became known, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, direct and unmistakable."
However, the vote by Grema is obviously put in stone.
"I have taken a decision on Brett Caveno, and it will require a devastating charge," he said.
"Dr. Forda, I don't know what happened, but I know what: Brets strongly rejected it," Grems added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names could confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there's any change to be expected."
What is the World Citizens’ Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be a World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and a mission as well: reducing poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens' Festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will meet in the Great Wall of Central Park not only to enjoy the premieres, such as Genettes Jacksons, Cordi B (Cardi B) and Sean Mendes, but also to increase their understanding of the real goal of the event, which is the end of poverty by 2030.
The festival "Global Citizen Festival", launched in 2012, is an event created by the International Defence Group "Global Poor Project", which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who actively fight poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to this measure (unless there was a wish to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work", such as doing voluntary work, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a telephone call or any other important activity to promote understanding of the end of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been, which has remained for 12 more years to achieve?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert a good way to convince people to act, or just another so-called "knitivism" case when people think they really can influence by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter report?
The Global Citizen movement claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million of its supporters in an effort to achieve different objectives.
It informs that these actions have helped world leaders to report on commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion and will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and notifications resulting from activities for which at least US$ 10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" — a partnership of investors and implementing partners established in the United Kingdom who committed to "helping children to grow fully", promising to provide Rwanda with 35 million US dollars to help end the country's unavailable diet after more than 4700 Twitter reports from world citizens.
"With the United Kingdom government, donors, the governments of other countries and the citizens of the world like you, we can leave us in the history of the lack of adequate nutrition in the history of social injustices," at the London concert in April 2018, the representative of "The Power of Nutrition" was announced.
The group also mentioned that after the start of more than 5000 measures, calling on the UK Government to provide better food for mothers and children, the government announced that it would grant funding to the Power of Nutrition project, which would provide food to 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website -- "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"Global Citizen" commented: "It will be a long and long way in which we will suffer some failures.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-participation movements have done so before us, so we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae (Janelle Monae) are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Fernes (Deborra-Lee Furness) and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use war fleets to "block" to delay Russian energy exports – Minister of Home Affairs claims
"If necessary," Washington could use its war fleet to delay Russian energy market entry, including in the Middle East," said US Interior Minister Rains Zinke (Ryan Zinke), quoted as saying "Washington Examiner".
Zinke claimed that Russia’s activities in Syria, particularly in places where it operates under the legal invitation of the government, are well - known for the investigation of new energy markets.
"I think the reason why it is in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy just as it does in Eastern Europe — in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, through its military fleet, can ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot put its energy on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the public who had come to visit the action undertaken by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to addressing the situation in Russia and Iran, indicating that they are actually equal.
"The economic opportunity of Iran and Russia is more or less the use and substitution of fuel," he said, at the same time referring to Russia as a country whose economy is mainly dependent only on fossil fuels.
More claims that the trampa administration promotes liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, thus replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trampa's administration officials and also US President Donald Tramps are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas management project that would make Berlin "depends" on Moscow, according to Tramp.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion worth of North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which doubles the existing gas power to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlis believes that the Washington burning opposition project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers must be able to choose the supplier," said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novaks after a meeting in Moscow in September with US Minister of Energy Riku Perij.
The US has expressed its negative view of Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The German Industrial Industry Organisation — the German Industrial Federation (BDI) — has called on the United States to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would feel a great problem if a third country was involved in our energy supply," said German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, director of the German Federation of Industry (BDI).
Senator Elizabette Vorena will seriously consider his candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
The Senate of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Vorena, announced on Saturday that it was a serious consideration to run for the presidency after the mid-term elections.
At the House meeting in Holioka, Massachusetts, Vorena confirmed that she considered running the presidential election.
"And the real time for women in Washington to "save" the incomplete government, which also means women-presidents," her words are reflected in the newspaper "The Hill".
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider my candidacy in the election of the President of the United States."
During the House's meeting, Vorena referred to President Donald Tramp, claiming that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"My heart is deeply disturbed by what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Vorena has openly criticised tramp and his elected Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno.
On Friday's Twitter report, Vorena said, "Of course, before the elections, the FBI needs an investigation."
However, the survey published on Thursday found that most of Vorana's supporters do not think she should be candidates for the 2020 election.
According to the results of the Boston Globe Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk, 15 percent of the "possible" voters of Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not run for election.
Thirty-two percent supported such a decision.
The results revealed that more support had been given by former Governor Devals Patricks, receiving 38 per cent of the election and 48 per cent against.
In the context of the possible nomination of 2020, the names of the members of the Democratic Party as former Vice-President Joe Baidens and Senator Bernie Sanderss appear in the high profile.
The news agency Associated Press reported that Baidens is committed to making an official decision by January.
Sarah Pelina quotes Treka Pelina PTSS Donald Trampa in the village
Treks Peillin (26) spent a year in Iraq after being invited to the railway station in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"To whom my own son goes through, to whom he goes through after his return, I can extend to other families facing the consequences of PTSS and some of the dose vulnerabilities that our soldiers return to," she told the audience at Donald Trump's town in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pelina called his arrest "an obvious problem that everyone seems to be invisible" and told his son and other war veterans that "they will return a little different, they will return patiently, they will return wondering whether they are appreciated by their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as all the other members of the military field have given to this country".
According to the representative of the Vasil Police Department Den Beneta, he was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and accused of violence in the family concerning women and the holding of arms while in a state of alert.
18 states, Colombia area with a challenge for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian area support a legal challenge to the new US policy preventing asylum victims fleeing the gang or violence in the family.
The representatives of the 18 states and the Colombian area in Washington presented a brief statement to the court council on Friday to support asylum seekers facing the obstacles created by that policy, "NBC News".
The full name of the applicant is Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union started in August against federal politics, has not been discovered.
She claimed that her partner "and the son of his violent gang member" abused her, but the US officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers, who supported Greece, described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of which come from US asylum seekers, as the countries where the problem is spread by gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the decision of the Immigration Appeals Council in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing the family from violence to seek asylum.
On Friday, the Attorney General of the Colombian Region, Karl Racín, announced that the new policy "ignores the laws of the state, the federal and the international.
"Federal law provides that all requests for asylum are examined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim concerned and that such an obstacle violates this principle," the court council briefed.
In addition, the lawyer stated in his statement that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering the country is detrimental to the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessons (Jeff Sessions) addressed immigration judges with a request no longer to grant asylum victims who flee from family violence and gang abuse.
"The example is available to people who leave their homeland for persecution or fear related to their race, religion, nation, belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Seshons said in his statement on 11 June.
Asylum has never been designed to deal with all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Illustrative rescue efforts by the number of people who have fallen double in the search for survivors
The situation became increasingly difficult for the survivors.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusuma, calming her drudgery child in the city's evacuation centre.
"For a minute, the rapid medical assistance service introduces new victims.
Clean water is scarce."
The people were visible when they returned to their ruined homes and moved into the water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals suffering from an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Haris (Dwi Haris), who had had a vertebral column and back, slept outside the Pale Army hospital, where patients were cared for because of the indomitable force of pregnancy.
His eyes burst with tears, remembering how a strong earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
It seems I was printed in a wall drawer," the news agency Associated Press said to Harris, noting that his family had arrived for marriage in the city.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador charges China with the use of propaganda advertisements
A week after the official Chinese newspaper came forward with four long advertisements, highlighting the mutual benefits of the US and China trade, the US Ambassador accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the annex paid by China Day in the state of Aiova's most sold newspaper Des Moines Register, accusing China of attempting to interfere with the election of the US Congress on 6 November, but China rejects it.
Tramp's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the U.S. election marked what US officials said to the news agency "Reuters", that it was a new stage in the growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an increasing trade war, as a result of which they apply a series of tariffs to each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, Chinese repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in states such as the People's Republic of the Republic of Aiov, who supported the Rampa party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terij Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term governor in Aiov, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion on the Sunday edition of "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubles this announcement by putting propaganda ads on our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the so-called free and free press tradition of speaking for America, by inserting a paid advertisement "Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, you will find a limited number of different views and do not see the true reflection of such different views that Chinese people may have in relation to the worrying economic trajectory of China, given that the media is here under the strict supervision of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He noted that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans welcoming female voters from mid-term elections involving the Kaveno scandal
As many leading Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, against which several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that the expected mid-term elections will have a negative reaction, especially on the part of women.
Related emotions have been extremely high, and most Republicans are already ready to deliver their votes.
Such things cannot be undone, "in the Saturday article "The Hill" said Professor of Science at the University of Syracuse Maxwell School of Policy, Grant Reeher.
Rühers questioned that the recent encouragement of Senator Jeff Fleik (R-Arizona) to conduct a FIB investigation would be quite a cause for calming the angry voters.
"The girls will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it either tomorrow or November," according to Washington, D.C. on Friday, Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior advisor and national representative of the progressive movement "MoveOn" said.
On Friday morning, the protestors of the Senate protested on the first day of November, when the Republicans under the authority of the Court Committee chose to proceed with the nomination of Kaveno, despite the testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," the independent political analyst Stjø Rotenberg (Stu Rothenberg) told the news portal.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
However, it could be even higher, especially between the citizens of the country and the youngest voters (from 18 to 29 years of age), who often do not go to the elections even if the President does not like them."
Even before the Forda's public testimony, in which she stated allegations of sexual violence on the part of the Supreme Court candidate, analysts would have failed if Republicans continued to apply for this candidacy.
"The party of those Republicans has become a sensitive mess," said Michael Steel, former president of the National Committee of Republicans at the beginning of last week.
"It is not just about the Committee's vote or the final vote, or about whether Caveno will be tried, it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priority USA, who is leading this group, helping to elect Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans have been a little divided with regard to those who believe in Forda's and Caven's testimonies, a little more attempting to believe the last.
The new survey "YouGov" shows that 41 per cent of respondents are either definitely or mostly inclined to believe in the Forda's testimony, while 35 per cent claim that they are definitely or mostly inclined to believe the Caven's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Kaveno may have lied about his testimony until only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that, following Fleika's encouragement, the FIB is currently investigating the claims made by Forda and at least one other defendant — Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Forda pointed out to the Senate Judicial Committee that, at the age of 17, Kaveno had taken a drink against his sexual assault.
Ramirez states that during the course of his studies in Jeil in 1980, a candidate from the Supreme Court showed her his genius at a ballet.
Global Web Designer plans to start a new internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tims Børnerss-Lī (Tim Berners-Lee), a global web designer, launches a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project "Inrupt" of the Legend of Technology is a company based on the open-source platform "Solid".
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Childrenss-Li joked that "Inrupt"'s secret intention is "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The use of "Solid" technology is used to enable people to create their own "personal online data storage" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like, if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available simultaneously in one browser.
The storage of personal online data is unique in that only the user determines what and what kind of information can be accessed.
It is referred to as "personal powers through data".
According to the company leader John Bruce (John Bruce), the idea of "Inrupt" is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make "Solid" available to everyone.
The company now operates the Childrenss-Li, Bruce, IBM-acquired security platform, some external developers dedicated to the project, and a voluntary community of encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the "Inrupt" website.
Childrenss-Li said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make complete changes during one night completely turning all their business models.
"We don't want his permission."
On Saturday, the newspaper Childrenss-Li stated that "Inrupt" "the mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid".
In 1994, Childrenss-Li transformed the Internet into a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Childrens-Li has had an influential view in the discussions on network neutrality.
Even after the launch of "Inrupt" Childrenss-Li will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I am truly optimistic about this new web era," said Childrenss-Li.
Bernard Vann: Marking the Victorian Cross assigned to the emperor during World War I
For 100 years now, in its hometown, the event is marked by the fact that the only preacher of the Church of England has received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter.
Colonel Bernard Vens received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglies and Lehaukort.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he did not know of the highest British military award.
On Saturday’s show in Rašden, Northamptonshire, she discovered two small pieces of stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was "scattered symbolically", that such a stone was discovered just 100 years after his grandfather had received a significant reward.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vens led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "through the very frequent fog and large spaces and campfires."
Later, he rushed to the shooting line and with the utmost certainty led this line forward before the reception of the large-scale zone, where three groups were built.
Colonel Venu killed the German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a few months before the end of the war.
Michael Vens (72) said that his grandfather's action was "a murder that I could never do, and that at the same time is also a very humble action".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also served as the winner of the Brantwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vens claimed that he felt "deserved by participating in this show", and noted that "the value of a true hero shows the support of many people".
MMA fans waited all night "Bellator 206", but instead expected Pussy Pepu
Imagine being accompanied up all night to see "Bellator 206", but at the end you are denied this main event view.
The Sanhos poster included 13 battles, including six main maps, which were broadcast online all night long in UK Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., when Gegard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were about to face each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised to find that the transmission was being replaced by Buciņš Pepu.
Some were really confused when all night until early in the morning they were left in the room waiting for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the transmission change to children's multifilm as "failable joke".
"The government has determined that the content of this kind is not acceptable after 6.00, so the transmission to the children's programme took place," explained Dev Schwartz (Dave Schwartz), the Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication.
"Fuck Pepa," "yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Koker (Scott Coker) said he would work on schedule planning so that visitors in the United Kingdom could see these broadcasts.
"I think that we will be able to sort it out in a way," Kokers said.
"But the clock is there six in the morning, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many texts appeared after the transmission, and they weren't positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical error.
But that was not it, it was controlled by the government.
I can assure you that there will be no such problem the next time.
We will hold on to five fights, not six (as it has been so far), but we will try to please fans, but we will concentrate.
It is a failure."
"Desert Island Discs": Toms Daily didn't feel good enough for her sexuality
The Olympic kidney, Tom Daley, claims that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man didn't realize that "not all are like me" until he started attending high school.
During his first radio 4 "Desert Island Discs", led by Lauren Laverne, he mentioned that he began talking about homosexual rights to give others "provision".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent director of the long-term programme, has been in pain for several months.
As it turned out, in Laverne's first programme, Deilius said that as he grew, he felt "lesser" than others, because "the society is not supposed to like both girls and boys".
He said, "To this day I feel that I am not as good as others, or that I am different, has been the main engine that has given me the strength and stamina to achieve success."
He said he wanted to prove that there was a "killing" to keep people from hoping when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner has become the leader of the high-level LGBT campaign and has used his appearance in the Consistency Games of this year in Australia, calling for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he decided to talk to the public because he felt happy that he was able to live openly and without any difficulty and wanted to give a "probate" to others.
The world's three-time champion said that love for a man in the US filmmaker in Dustin Lans Black (Dustin Lance Black), whom he met in 2013, was "surprisingly unprepared".
Deilie, who was married to an older Oscar award winner last year for 20 years, claimed that the age difference had never been an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so much for so little age" (her first Olympic games were at 14 years of age, and her father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone at your age who has experienced similar tops and falls.
The couple became the eldest son, Roberts Reys Blakes-Deilley (Robert Ray Black-Daley), and Delhi claimed that his "all perspective" had changed.
"For the first year everything that mattered to me was the acquisition of a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? Life is more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robys."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daily mentioned that his father did not want to accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked Daily was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games where he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that she would no longer be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
In the following year, Deilie took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to enter the home in the Olympic Games. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song – the "Proud" played by Heather Small, who reasoned with him on his way to the achievements in the Olympics and always ate the zosade.
The program "Desert Island Discs" will be heard on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 a.m. after the British summer time.
Made out of shape in the reserve floor of Mikelson at the Raider Cup Saturday
American Son Mikelson (Phil Mickelson) will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ridera Cup game match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a successful turn of events.
Mikelson, who has already attended the two-year-old championship every 12 years, was seated on the reserve floor Saturday for four ball games and two pairs of games.
Instead of being at the centre of action as often as it has been associated with the US teams, the fifth winner divided his day by acting both as a supporter and by participating in his game with the hope of correcting what is wrong with him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most precise player even on the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the hasty fight "Le Golf National" in an uneven field where the exact seats are regularly punished.
And if the game itself isn't scary enough for itself, on Sunday's ninth match, Mikelson will fight with the British player Frankesco Molinari (France Molinari), who has joined forces with the new Tommy Fleetwood, to win all four matches this week.
If Americans who are left with four points at the start of 12 single-players were successful, Mikelson’s sword could play a decisive role.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate without saying anything.
"He was fully aware of his role today, stretched me over my back, applied his hand to me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furiks.
"He is very confident about himself.
He is a great sportsman who gave so much to these teams earlier and also this week.
I don't think I imagined him playing in two cats.
I imagined more, but it was as bad as it was, and we'll figure it out.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will give Nick Faldo (Nick Faldo) a record of the most played cats in the Raider Cup fight Sunday.
It could mark the end of the race career of the Raider Cup, which has never really coincided with the heights of his individual record.
Mikelson has won 18 wins, has suffered 20 losses and seven undisclosed games, although Furiks claimed that his presence gave the team some material benefits.
"He's sensitive, sarcastic and smart, he likes to be concerned about people, and he's a great team member," he explained.
"I think the latest players also liked to round them up this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just games."
European elections Captain Thomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) knows that a major milestone can be quickly resolved
European elections Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a major milestone in the management of the fight for the last days of the Raider Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
In 1997 Danish debuted in Valderram, where the team of opponents, the captain of Siv Baljesteros (Sev Ballesteros), won five points over the Americans, but only now went on the finish line with a very small score, winning with 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"You continued to remind yourself that we had been heavily guided by Valderram; we had been guided by Brooklyn where we had lost, and Valderram where we had won, but only with a small advantage," said Bjorns (in the picture), pointing to the 2018 release group victory with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, leading with 10-6 golf courses in Le Golf National.
Thus, history will show to me and to every member of its team that nothing has ended.
Tomorrow you'll give up everything.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
This will not end until the points obtained on the screen are visible.
Our goal is to get this trophy and focus on it.
I have always said that I have focused on 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what the other side is against us, the world's greatest players."
As soon as Bjorn pointed out the performance of his players in the golf course, he said, "I never liked the agro.
New challenges await tomorrow.
Individual games are scheduled tomorrow, and it is quite another thing.
It's great if in moments when everything goes well, you have a partner with you, but in individual games your golfer's skills are fully checked.
This message you must give to your players, that is, that they in the next day's game give all of themselves.
Now you leave your partner, and he must also show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's team of opponents, Captain Jim Furiks will watch to show his players his best performance in individual rather than partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spytt (Jordan Speeth) and Justin Thomas (Justin Thomas), who got three points out of four.
Fariks himself has been on both sides of these important last-day tournaments – both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later as a result of the European team's experience of sensational success, which is later known as the "Miracle at Medina" in the golf world.
"Atcers every condemned word," he said, in response to Ben Crenshaw's 1999 team captain, joined his players in the last day's fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get to the fast show that you've been to Brooklyn, which you've been to the Medina.
When such a impulse is broadcast in one direction, it creates great pressure for mid-term games.
We created our own composition and talked to the guys in a way that seemed right to us. Let's try to do some magic tomorrow."
Tomas had been assigned the task of trying to drive the attack, and he entered the main game of Rory McIlroy and the Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter.
"I'm sardinding guys in this order, because I think it's best suited during the tournament," Bjorn said about the selected players.
Delayed transmission of the new German flag to operation
The German fleet's latest fleet had to be put into service in 2014, thus replacing the old Cold War warships, but it will not take place until at least the next year due to the system of errors and rising costs, it reported the local media.
The transfer of the main ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" to the Baudenes-Virtemberg Freight Class is now delayed until the first half of 2019, as reported in the Die Zeit newspaper, quoting the military representative.
The ship was to join the Caraflot in 2014, but the unfavourable after-supply problems had an impact on the fate of the vast project.
Four vessels of the Baden-Virtemberg class ordered by the Caraflote in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
It is expected that they will be equipped with a powerful range of anti-aircraft and anti-shipcraft rockets, as well as some hidden technologies such as a reduced perception of radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods – it must be possible to deploy new freightes up to two years away from the ports in which they are registered.
However, the constant delay is that the latest technology battleships that would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in overseas countries will already be old by the time it comes into operation, notes "Die Zeit".
The F125 failed last year was considered to be all the headlines when the German fleet officially refused to ship for operation and sent it back to the shipyard "Blohm & Voss" in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned to the shipyard after the ship was delivered.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for this step, but the German media mentioned a number of significant "software and equipment defects", which would render warships useless if it were used in the battle mission.
The lack of software was a particularly important factor as vessels of the Baden-Virtemberg class are operating around 120 large crews, only half of the older Bremen class.
It also showed that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the fleet to make its improvements in the future.
It is considered that the 7000 tonnes heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as similar class ships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the wrong apparatus, all the costs of the project (including crew training) have also become a major problem.
It is said that its costs have reached EUR 3.1 billion instead of EUR 2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in view of recent warnings of a reduction in the German sea forces.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the car fleet really "starts to miss the ship to be used".
The official claimed that over time this problem has been significantly smeared, since old ships are being removed from operation but are not being delivered in place.
He regretted that none of the bade-virtemberg class frigates joined the Caraflote.
"National Trust" Listens to the Life of a Hidden Flying Bird
The new study carried out in some property of the Scottish floor is aimed at discovering how the spiders in the food search process use the scene.
The findings are expected to introduce new clarity on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to help them in future protection measures.
Scientists from Scotland "National Trust" in Inverves gardens in Westeros will study pulverized birds, pygmy birds, as well as brown long-haired birds and water pulverized birds.
Special recorders will be located in the main premises, tracking the poultry activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The sound experts shall analyse all records to determine the frequency of the beaks and the species carrying out the specific activities.
The biotopes map and the report will then be developed to create a detailed view of the scene reflecting the behaviour of the wings.
NTS Nature Conservation Adviser Robs Dewar (Rob Dewar) hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for wings and how each species is used.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the biotopes management work such as the establishment of landfills and the best possible conservation of forests for herring and other related species.
During the last century, the population of skeletal birds in Scotland and the United Kingdom has suffered a significant decline.
These lands are threatened by construction and development works that affect the loss of their nests and habitats.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, like shell paper and some building materials chemical treatment, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, the wings are not blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than eyes during hunting.
They use a complex method of determining the location of the support to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land maintenance throughout the country, has a very serious understanding of the problem of wing wing.
The organisation has ten trained experts who carry out regular surveys, inspection of slippers and sometimes even rescue works.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reserve for special fins in Scotland in the property of "Threave" in Damfris and Galova, where eight of the ten species of fins found in Scotland are milled.
The property manager David Thompson (David Thompson) claims that this area is ideally suited for wings.
"This is a great place for slippers," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and generally suitable biotopes.
But there are still a lot of things we don't know about spiders, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need for survival."
He stresses that it is important to check that there are no sparrows at the site, as it may happen that as a result of the unidentified destruction of one mother shelter, up to 400 mothers and their babies are killed, thus possibly destroying the entire local population.
The wings are protected by animals, and they must not be killed, washed, disturbed or destroyed by their hideouts.
Ms. Elizabeth Ferela (Elysabeth Ferrell) asked the staff of the Scottish Six-Friend Protection Fund (Bat Conservation Trust) to help the company.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about spiders, and for several species we just don't know how to dress them."
Ronaldo rejects the prosecution by ordering lawyers to sue the German Journal in court
Kristian Ronald (Christian Ronaldo) has condemned the accusations they have made as "false news", claiming that people "want to pay attention" by using his name.
Her lawyers have been ordered to appeal to the court of the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which published these claims.
The Portuguese origins and Turin's Juventus football star are accused of finding American Kathryn Majorga (Kathryn Mayorg) in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid the woman $375 000 to keep quiet about this incident, so on Friday he announced "Der Spiegel".
Some hours after this statement, Ronalda, 33, using Instagram's online video, addressed his 142 million followers, calling this information "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the winner of the Ballon d'Or award in the camera.
"They want to become famous using my word.
It's normal.
They want to become famous for my word, it's part of my work.
I am a happy person, and everything is good," added the player laughing.
According to the information provided by Reuters, Ronaldo advocates are going to appeal to the court to the journal "Der Spiegel" about the claims they have made about "unacceptable disclosure of suspicion in the area of privacy".
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to such a extent as is consistent with the severity of the infringement that may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
This incident occurred in June 2009 in the hotel's "Palms Hotel and Casino" "suit" class room in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted by the Nevada State District Court, Ronald and Majorga went back to the hotel number of the player, where he found the woman.
Majorga claims that after that incident Ronaldo's cricket was on his way and said that there was "a 99 per cent good boy" but a cricket in this "one per cent" cricket.
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronald confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that would have happened after mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and that she was taken to the hospital with the trauma photos, but later she agreed to an extradited settlement because she felt "fears of activism" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she no longer wants to accept the terms of this agreement, since that incident left a permanent trauma.
At the time of the above claims, Ronald was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer for 100 million euros went to the Italian Grand Juventus.
Brexit: The United Kingdom's ever-funned loss of car manufacturers
"The United Kingdom "will regret it forever if after Brexit it loses its world leader's position in the production of cars," said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
Their concern is that Toyota UK has notified BBC that if Britain withdraws from the EU without agreement, it will temporarily suspend production near the existing factory in Burnston in Dribia.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that delaying borders in Brexit could lead to a job without agreement.
In the last year, the Toyota factory, Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the other Member States of the European Union.
"I think, then, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped," said Toyota Managing Director of Burnston Marvin Cooke (Marvin Cooke).
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have been reluctant to withdraw from the EU without a contract and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexit per month he will close his mini factory in Oxford.
As car manufacturers claim, the main concerns are about the chain of supply at risk if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
The Toyota production line operates according to the principle of "exploring time", where the cars manufactured at the time of the order have more than 37 minutes from both the United Kingdom and EU suppliers.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without agreement, there could be disturbances at the border that could lead to some delays and deficiencies.
According to Toyota, it would not be possible to hold more than one day's worth of inventory at its Dübbyshire plant, so production would have to be stopped.
Mr. Klarka said that the "exposure plan" developed by Theresa Mejas (Theresa May) for future relations with the EU is "precisely calculated to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit at the present time, but also to use this option," he said in Radio 4 "Today".
"It is not only from Toyota, but also from other producers that we must be able to fully continue the very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota’s failure to tell how long production could be stopped, but warned that long-term rising costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately endanger jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and works as the Union Association Coordinator, said that his members are feeling more and more concerned: "I can say from experience that as soon as a job is lost, it will not return."
The government representative said, "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Tramp meeting with Rosenstein can be resumed again, report White House
Donald Trampa's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (Rod Rosenstein) can be "remained for another week", as the fight with the Supreme Court judge's candidate Bret Kaveno continues, so the White House reported on Sunday.
Rozenstein is monitoring the involvement of Special Adviser Robert Miller (Robert Mueller), who investigates the interference of Russia's will, the link between the resources used by trampa and Russia, and the possible lack of respect for the rule of law by the President.
For months, Washington has been considering whether Trump will resign from the Deputy Attorney General and thus threaten Miller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rozenstein had discussed the signing of negotiations with Tramp and the possibility of leaving the President with Amendment 25.
Rosensteins has no such information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, where he spoke about his resignation.
Instead, it was announced a Thursday meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Tramps said that "better" did not leave Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a dispute with the Senate's judicial committee, which showed both Kaveno and one of the women who accused him of committing sexual abuse — Dr. Kristíne Blezia Forda.
On Friday, Trumps had the FIB investigate for weeks in connection with Kaveno's complaints, and continued to delay the Senate's vote.
Trampa Press Secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News Sunday.
She replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or a week, taking into account all the cases that are taking place around the Supreme Court.
But we'll see that, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters challenge this claim: Sandersa has not acted on a White House press briefing since 10 September.
The leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sandersa said that the lack of skill is not linked to the dissatisfaction with the television reporters 'flavouring', although she added: 'I reject the fact that they are a glory.'
She then proposed direct contact between Trump, resulting in an increased interest in the press.
"The President took part in more questions and answers sessions than any president before her," she said, and without giving any details, she said, "We are interested in their number."
Sandersa claimed that the briefings would always take place, but, "if the press will be able to ask the President of the United States questions uninterruptedly, it is undoubtedly better than talking to me.
We are trying to do a lot, and you see that we've done a lot of it in the last few weeks, and it's going to be a press briefing instead of when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Tramps regularly answer questions by leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences visited by important people.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The President may have demonstrated his reasons this week in New York, focusing on the rapporteur's uncontrollably and sometimes strange expressions.
Minister of Health writes to EU employees of Scotland NHS on fears related to Breksit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude and to delay their endurance after Brexit.
Gin Freeman (Jean Freeman) MSP sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Fremena wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued during spring on the withdrawal which led to the decisions to be taken this autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for the possible scenario if no agreement is reached.
I know this is a very restless time for you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the involvement of each employee regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care service and benefit our caring patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we very much want you to stay here."
After a head injury to Kristjem Abercrombie, an emergency operation is performed
Theresa State Protector Kristên Abercrombie (Christion Abercrombie) had an emergency operation after a head trauma he won in Saturday's game, with the result of the 31-27 "Vanderbilt Commodores" awards, reported sports reporter "Tennesean" Mike Organs (Mike Organ).
The state team’s chief coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the trauma was suffered shortly before the half-life.
"He came to the side line and said it was ruined," said Ryds.
While Abercrombie was on the side line, the trainers and medical personnel gave him oxygen, then he put on the bench and delivered them to further investigation.
One of the state officials in Tennessee told the reporter Chris Harris (Chris Harris) in Tennessee that Abercrombie was being operated at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that we are currently "no information on the type/difficulty of the trauma", and the state team in Tennessee is trying to figure out when this trauma is coming.
Abercrombie, a Red Crescent representative, is in his first season after Ilonise's replacement against the state team in Tennessee.
Before leaving the Saturday game, he had performed five blocks in general, which made up a total of 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher national fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom
A higher national fee will be applied to foreign buyers when purchasing property in the United Kingdom and the additional funds obtained will be used to assist homeless people in accordance with the new Tory plan.
This step will neutralize Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
An increased national tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The national cash register provides that up to 120 million bills can be collected per year to provide assistance to homeless people.
A higher national fee will be applied to foreign buyers by buying property in the United Kingdom and by sending the additional aid to homeless people, which will be announced today by Teresa Meja.
This step is considered to be an attempt to neutralize the efforts made by Jeremy Corbyn to attract new voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to talk about the more sustainable part of society.
The increased national tax will be applied to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, in addition to the money they receive, to the government’s efforts to combat the problem of homeless people.
The premium included in the current national levy, including the application of a higher level of charge two years ago for the purchase and purchase of another place for rent, could be as high as three percent.
The State Treasury provides that such a step may complement its budget to up to 120 million dollars per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built property is acquired by non-residents, thus raising prices and making it difficult for the first-time buyers to get to their home.
Many of the country's permanent territories, especially in the capital, have become "spok cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers, most of which spend their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson (Boris Johnson) called for a reduction in the national tax so that more new people could be allowed to buy their first apartment.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by grabbing land, but not using it, and urged Ms Mejas to abandon quotas for affordable housing in order to address the issue of British housing.
Mr Korbina has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including the reform of rent control and exit from the house without cause.
He also wants to give the Council more powers for the construction of new homes.
Ms. Mejas said: "Last year I mentioned that I would use my Prime Minister's position to restore the British dream - that is, every new generation must have a better quality of life.
And that means the organisation of the housing market in our warehouse.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and arrange their lives.
However, it is not right that homes can be bought as easily as foreign companies and people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as the British people who work hard.
Many dreams about their home have become too far away, and the problem of homeless people in tears is still up to date."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to run Scotland."
Sunderland's leader, Jack Ross, claims that his biggest goal is at some point to become Scotland's leader.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which now takes third place in the first league with three points from above.
This summer he went to the Stadium of Light after the St. Mirren was introduced back in Scotland's premier season.
"As a player I wanted to play my country.
I got a B cup, and that's all," said Ross to the Scottish "BBC" broadcast.
"But I grew up, along with my father looking at the Scottish games in Hampden Park, and it has always called me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be shown if I were successful in running the club."
Rosa's predecessor is Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Guss Poyet and Paulo Di Kanio.
The former president of Alloa Athletic claims that he has not been disturbed by following so many well-known leaders of the club, previously rejecting the offers made by Barnsley and Ipsvičja.
"My achievements will now be assessed as to whether I will be able to return to this club as a premier.
Because of the structure and possibilities of this club, it certainly fits in with the premier," he said.
"Returning the club to the premier front will not be an easy task, but I will probably think that I will be successful here only when this task is done."
Ross is only in the third year of his career as a director in Dumbarton, and spends a 15-month period in the composition of "Hearts" coaches.
Then he helped the club Alloa get back from falling to third level and in the same season helped St Mirren get the champion title.
Ross claims that he now feels much more comfortable than his player's career in the clubs "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"These may have been real crossroads," he recalls, taking responsibility for Alloa.
"I really believed that management was my real call – much more appropriate than playing.
It was a failure, for I was successful, and I was able to live and enjoy some of the heights.
However, playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but management is my field.
I've always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it. It seems that I'm in the right place, I don't feel so good all my life."

The summer heat wave has left Britain with less popular traffic, but it has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The aggregated data revealed that in July the sales of cows and pigs increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants they decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Mārtins (Peter Martin), who represents the CGA Agency for Business Consulting, who collected the data, said: "Continually, the solar time and participation in the World Cup campaign in England meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, i.e. the profit of the round had increased by 2.8 percent, while the restaurants had fallen.
Restaurants with a fall of 1.8 per cent in June experienced even more difficult situations in July.
The situation in the drinking troughs and bars was most grateful because they experienced a lot higher than the restaurants experienced a low level.
Food-based tires are also hard from the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant workers felt it.
It seemed that people simply wanted to go out for a drink.
In cows and bar drinks, monthly sales increased by 6.6 per cent, while food sales decreased by 3 per cent."
RSM recreation and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: "These results continue to be the trend that was observed at the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of broad social or sport measures are the major factors determining turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to fight, although the sales drop of 4,8 per cent compared to the period in question last year will be particularly painful for the extra inexhaustible cost pressure.
With regard to food providers in the long and hot summer, it was not possible to arrive at an even more inappropriate time, and time will indicate whether the more moderate temperature normally experienced in August will provide the necessary space."
The total sales increase between bars and restaurants, including in new companies, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a reduction in the sales volume of brands.
"Coffer Peach Tracker" is a sales monitor for the UK market, bars and restaurants, collecting and analysing the data of 47 operating groups where the total turnover exceeds 9 billion sterlings, and this is the industry's criterion.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account it hides from their parents
The report reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
In an area where 20,000 high school students attended, there was a false increase in Instagram’s pages.
These reports raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
Each fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, forms social media accounts that they hide from adults.
In an interview involving 20,000 high school students, Instagram found that the number of false profiles in the photo collection site is increasing rapidly.
These reports raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students mentioned that they had a "clear principal" account to show their parents and also private accounts.
A mother in her 13 - year - old daughter’s hiding place discovered a teenager who encouraged others to win her over.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the HMC found that 40 percent of the 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and only half of them recognized that they were maintaining private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said, "And it's scary that so many teenagers form online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elida Doila will be a "soft voice" in the Scottish Government
At the annual meeting of the Management Board of Elidh Doyle, the Management Board of Scotland was elected as Director of the Executive Board.
Doila is Scotland's most rewarding space and outdoor lighthouse, and President Ian Beitijs (Ian Beattie) described this step as a great opportunity for those who are driven by sports to use her vast experience at international level over the past ten years.
"The Eilida is dedicated to great respect throughout Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world in the light-year community, and we are confident that Scotland will gain tremendously, by involving it in the government," Bithynia said.
Doila said, "I want to act as a "soft voice" and hope that I can really get involved and help drive this sport in Scotland."

Comments on breast milk pump advertising comparing mothers with cows
The dairy production company has taken care of shared views online with regard to the advertising where nursing mothers are compared to cattle feeding.
In order to mark the so-called "world's first silent breast pump" turnover, consumer technology company Elvie launches a flexible prayer advertisement to demonstrate the freedom provided by the new pump to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers danced with a wall-filled cow at a song whose words are like, "Yes, I cry myself, but you don't see any eyes" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not sad, they're my breast."
The landing continues: "Send, send, I'll feed the little ones, send, send, I'll kiss my ladies."
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has called for a wide online resonance.
77,000 times the video and hundreds of times the comments of the viewers have been shared, and many claim that it highlights in the light of the milk industry the "woess".
"It is a very wrong decision to use cattle for the advertising of the product.
Just as we, as they, to produce milk, have to get pregnant and have a baby, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after they were born," one wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk pump is non-slip for breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment says: "I understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise breast milk to mothers whose babies can keep their babies?"
The view was also expressed: "Advertisers did not know what they were doing."
Others advocated advertising, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was "quiet".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy it if I was still breast-feeding.
The milk withdrawal made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit of a joke, but I understand its idea.
This is a generic product," he wrote.
Another comment says: "This is fun advertising, which is meant for mothers who lose their milk (nearly in their jobs or in their toilets) and feel like "gooses".
It is not an advertising which celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, a group of women discovered that they all danced with unscathed pumps placed in their breasts.
The campaign’s concept is based on observation that many women who lose their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the "Elvie Pump" pump is completely silent, it has no pipe and no pipe, and it does not necessarily fit in the breast for nursing women, allowing them to move freely, keep small and even participate in activities outside the home.
Anna Balarina (Anna Balarin) "Mother" partner and creative director, commented: "Elvie Pump" is such a revolutionary product that it has earned a bold and challenging marketing.
By drawing parallels between women who shed milk and milk cows, we wanted to pay attention to the withdrawal of milk while at the same time demonstrating in a entertaining and understandable way the sense of freedom that will bring the new pump."
It's not the first time the "Elvie pump" pump has come to the center of attention.
In London’s Fashion Week, two children’s mothers appeared on the floor of Marta Jakubovski (Marta Jakubovski) looking at this product.
Hundreds of migrant children's silences moved to the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has grown rapidly, although the limits of each month are relatively many people, as before, and have partially been achieved by the rhetoric and policy of the trampa administration, which has made it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Usually most of the sponsors have also themselves been immigrants without documents, fearing that they will be in danger of leaving the country if they openly commit themselves to the child.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to be allowed to remove fingerprints and this data would also be transferred to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior officer of immigration and customs law enforcement, before the congress, showed that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for non-sponsored minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had not been previously punished.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or sponsors' households are illegally staying here, and many of these are criminals.
That is why we continue to pursue such persons," Mr Albensa said.
According to the asylum-seekers, officials have introduced new rules to ensure that some of them will have to go to court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, as the previous standard provided for.
Many will take advantage of the videoconferencing call rather than will come in person to defend their legal status before the immigration judge.
Persons who will be considered unfit for exemption will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are held in detention, the more likely they will be to become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or refugee attempts, the information provided by asylum workers and the evidence obtained from the system during the last months.
The lawyers argued that these concerns would be reinforced in larger objects, such as Tornillo, where signs of child suffering are more often overlooked because of their wideness.
They added that the movement of children to the city of tents, without spending enough time preparing them emotionally or allowing them to leave their friends, could lead to traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria forces the United States, France and Turkey "occupational armies" immediately to expel its troops
At the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Valids al-Moualems (Walid al-Moualem) also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has been raging for the past eight years.
Moualems, who also carries out Prime Minister's duties, claimed that foreign forces are illegal in Syria in defence of the fight against terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualems argued that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people and millions of people have died since 2011, they have been forced to leave their homes, "the fight against terrorism has almost ended".
He announced that Damascus will continue to "fight the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleansed", purified from both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States of America has deployed approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and consulting the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces, which are opponents of President Bashar Al Asada.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war - torn country.
As for the issue of refugees, Mualems announced that the conditions were great for them to return, and he blamed "the individual Western countries" for "the distribution of irrational fears", which is why refugees do not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicising what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be helped to rebuild the country before an agreement on the end of the war between Asada and the opposition is concluded.
The United Nations diplomats explain that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up buffers based on the latest dumpers in Idlib (Idlib) has created an opportunity to accelerate political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented the extensive attacks of the Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province of three million people.
However, Moualems stressed that the agreement "is certain time-limits" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-related group "Jhabat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
The UN envoy, Stefan de Mistura (Staffan de Mistura), looks forward to convening the new committees, which will include government and opposition representatives, the first meetings to draw up a post-war Syrian constitution and to pave the way for elections.
Moualems laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian State in the Committee, stressing that the work of the group would be limited to the "review of the existing Constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
From this point of view, Mr Trampa will be postponed in 2020's election, unless, and to this extent, many liberal observers, impatience and scandal are expected to give his presidency a preliminary ruling.
And in that case, "it will be the most dramatic final of all time!"
At present, there is no indication of the decommissioning of observers.
Since 2014, the rating in CNN’s most favourable radio time has more than doubled by reaching 1.05 million viewers, but the MSNBC has almost tripled by reaching 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News looks at 2.4 million viewers in the most favourable radio time compared to 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen informs the company, while MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" (Reicela Medova's show) is at the highest point in cable TV rating with 3.5 million main news viewers in the evening.

Of course, unlike anything else seen on TV, news from Washington could determine what will happen to the Rue's judgment on the Veid case, whether immigrant families can be united, and the global economic situation.
Ignoring is a threat that can only be permitted by the most privileged observers.
And yet this is more than to be informed to the citizen when at six o'clock watch expert groups discuss how Bob Woodward has used unspecified sources of information for his book Fair, Paul Manafort, $15,000 worth of bomber jackets from sharp colors and skin ("the mask from which the seams are high", said Washington Post), and what role will Stormy Daniels (Stormy Daniels) have to play in the annoying description of the anatomical details.

Money flows from outside in the pre-election campaigns of the most advanced mid-term Parliament
It is no wonder that the 17th Congressional Election Area seeks money through the transformation of Congress areas, which will result in the fight for one place by the two existing Members.
This recently transformed Pittsburgh nomadic area is linked to a Democratic Representative, Konor Lembu (Conor Lamb), who acquired his place in another area in the spring of last year's special election.
Lembs will fight with another existing member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th area of Pennsylvania, which is largely covered by the new 17th.
After the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old areas were unconstitutionally distributed for the benefit of the Republics, the cards were processed.
The competition in the new 17th area has led to the fight between the party's main financial groups: the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (National Campaign Committee).
Lembs became known in Pennsylvania when the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania won the wide - eyed election in March.
The Republicans had been holding this place for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in this area.
Political experts provide for a small majority of democratics.
The US considered Salvadoran punishment for supporting China, but then thought
The diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing without much pressure on the part of Washington.
Mr. Trampa had a friendly meeting in June 2017 with President Juan Carlos Varel (Juan Carlos Varela), and he stayed at the hotel in Panama until the partners were behind the door of the Trampa organisation's management team.
The officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the United States diplomatic missions from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of a "new decision no longer to recognise Taiwan", his department representative Hitter Nauerte (Heather Nauert) indicated in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalties were considered to apply only to Salvador, which received around 140 million dollars in 2017 from the United States, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include reducing financial assistance and limiting targeted visas, would be painful for the Central American country where the amount of unemployment and death has reached the highest level.
During the internal meetings, the North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference, focusing on security and economic well-being and following a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as an attempt to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
In mid-September, the country's highest officials clearly said that they wanted the conference to be held, in essence, to complete its observations on the punishment of Salvador.
The diplomats informed that Vice-President Mike Pence (Mika Pence) has now decided to participate in a conference scheduled in mid-October to show how serious the administration is stressing the meeting.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and serious statements or sentences on the part of Washington.
The representative of the White House, speaking on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not want to provide any further information on the debate, which was characterized by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to consult in the internal negotiations if their anonymity was maintained.
Their story was confirmed by a close external analyst to the administration, who also spoke on the condition that his anonymity would be preserved.
History Study
The second stone garden could contain a special report by the Special Prosecutor Robert Miller (Robert Mueller) that Mr. Trampa may have delayed justice, which has very much evidence in the public's possession.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If a second party wins the upper hand at Congress, Trapam will have to respond to this structure and possibly also to his fellow jury at the moment he is about to meet with the voters again.
There is a lot of "but" and I do not believe that the fall of the Trap is inevitable or that it will happen to his fellow citizens in Europe.
There are choices that will have to be made for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the length of the struggle.
In 1938 the German superiors were ready to turn against Hitler, unless the West opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We were thrown out, and we had a long chance to avoid the bloodbath that lasted for years.
History revolves around such turning points, and the uninterrupted march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now have to deal with a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trampa resigns General Rod Rosenstein — a man who controls Mr. Miller’s investigation fate?
Rozenstein has had difficulties since it was reported that last year he had a secret proposal to enter the negotiations with the President and thought about his inappropriate position.
Mr Rosenstein claims that the "The Times" story is not accurate.
"How do we answer, if the requested FBI investigation into Brett Caveno is not complete or honest, or if he is confirmed as a judge of the Supreme Court in spite of his unjust testimony and credible charges in the sexual assault?
And, most importantly, will we vote for the mid-term election of Congress, which will be called the Trump for responsibility?
If we do not endure all these tests, democracy will take a long winter.
But I believe that everything will work out for us by referring to what we have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my missionary home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn the Sabbath candles on the table with a pillow.

"Rangers" star Grams Dorrans (Graham Dorrans) feels optimistic about fighting with the Vienna "Rapid"
"Rangers" will take over the "Rapid" of Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Austrians after an impressive unresolved game in Spain with "Villareal" will allow them to take a stable position earlier this month to qualify from the European League G group.
The road trauma did not allow the centre's attacker, Grem Dorans, to re-enter the season's game until the unsolved result with 2:2 with "Villareal", but he believes that "Rangers" this result can be used as a trampline to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about this because "Villareal" is a good team," said 31-year-old footballer.
"We were going to play to be able to make good progress, and we got this point.
We may have been able to do so at the end of the day, but in general, it is a good result.
They may have been better in the first half, but we stayed in the second half and were better team.
And there will be another important night for Europe on Thursday.
Hopefully, we'll get three points, but it won't be easy because they got good results in the previous game, but I'm sure with the help of our supporters we'll be able to keep fighting and get good results.
Last year, with all my traumas and changes in the club itself, it was clearly difficult, but now there are new sensations that I feel good about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can continue the fight, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women cannot sleep because they are worried about their pension charges
Although the respondents knew clearly what care they wanted to receive, few had consulted family members on the matter.
Approximately half of the individuals in the national study indicated that they did not talk to their spouse about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent replied that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want them to be cared for by family members, but they don't do anything to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Agency.
Here's what you should start with.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You can’t prepare your family for you will need care if you don’t know your wishes for a long time before.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Get your financial advisor involved. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies with the amount of money to cover these costs, or security through your property, the main thing for you to have money.

Sarah Pelina's eldest son was arrested for charges of domestic violence
Treks Peillin (Track Palin), who was the oldest son of the former High Governor and vice president of Sara Pelinas, was arrested because he was charged with assault.
According to a report issued on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers police, 29-year-old Peillin, who lives in Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested in suspicion of domestic violence and opposition to arrest.
According to a police report, when a knowledgeable woman tried to call the police to report what she said about the crimes she had committed, he withdrew her phone.
Peelin has been detained in the Mat-Su Pre-Trial Detention Authority, and he has a $500-dollar security deposit, reports the KTUU.
He stood before the court on Saturday, where he was asked whether he considered himself guilty, declared that he "was definitely not guilty".
Pélina has been accused of three Class A violations for which he can be sentenced to a long prison sentence and a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of a Class B infringement, which can be received a day-long prison sentence and a $200 fine.
It is not the first time that Pelinna is accused of criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Totom Pelin.
Her mother, Sarah Pelina, called the police and reported an attack.
This case is currently being brought before the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In 2016, they were accused of domestic violence, of delaying the report on domestic violence and of carrying arms in the state of play in connection with this incident.

Earthquake caused by tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after Friday in the Indonesian island of Sulavesi.
7.5. The strong earthquake caused tsunamis and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been deployed and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place near the central part of Sulavesi, southeastern Indonesia’s capital Jakart.
There are videos on social networks that show a time of conflict.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in the city of Palais when the coastal tsunamis hit.
Federal Prosecutors would like to request a rare death penalty for a person suspected of terrorist acts in New York City.
Federal prosecutors want to demand execution of the death penalty by Sayfullo Saifov, who is suspected of a terrorist act in New York City when eight people were killed. This is a rare form of punishment that has not been committed since 1953.
According to one estimate, 30-year-old Saipov used home depot rental cars to attack a bike along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he hit the riders and riders on his way.
In order to justify the execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov 'with intent' killed eight victims and 'with intent' caused a serious injury, as mentioned in the notice of intent to seek the death penalty submitted to the New York District Court.
According to the court's documents, both of these charges may be brought to a death penalty.
Within weeks of the attack, the Federal Supreme Court adopted an appeal against Saipova's appeal against 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the purpose of extermination normally used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of ill-treatment and damage to motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and a prior intention", the prosecutors explained, stating that the attack by Saipova was "a shooting, inhuman and inhuman".
"Saifull Habibulajevičs Saipovs (Sayfull Habibulaevic Saipov) has injured, damaged and caused damage to these people's families and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini (Diego Enrique Angelini), Nikolas Klivs (Nicholas Cleves), Anna-Lorija Decadta (Ann-Laure Decadt), Darens Dries (Darren Drake), Ariel Elichs (Ariel Erlij), Ern Feruci (Hernan Ferruchi), Ernáns Diego Mendoza (Hernan Diego Mendoza) and Alejandro Damjans Pagnocco (Alejandre Damian Pagnucco)," said in a statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the New York District Court prosecutors have implemented a case in which the death penalty can be brought.
The accused Kalid Barns (Khalid Barnes) was sentenced to death by two drug suppliers, but in late 2009, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
For the last time in New York’s federal case, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in 1953 — a married couple who were sentenced to death for their participation in the declaration of participation in the Cold War of the Council of the Union two years ago.
The death penalty for Rozenberg was executed in an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan for days and months, did not show regret over the attack.
According to the police, he informed the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the complaint, Saipovs told officials that he was inspired to make an attack after viewing the ISIS video on his phone.
The police also informed him that he had requested permission to place the ISIS flag in his Chamber.
He has rejected the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "not satisfied by nature" on the charge decision.
"We believe that the intention to demand a death penalty rather than to accept a guilt confession in exchange for eternal imprisonment without the right to release will only extend the resulting trauma to all parties involved," Patons explained.
The Saipova defence team has previously called on prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
The Conservative Member declares that the management of Brexit's negotiations must be in favour of NAIDJEL FAREZ
Najgels Faražs, during the protests today, promised to "mobilize the nation's army".
Once the leader of the UK Independent Party announced that politicians should feel Eurosceptic anger when one of the members of the Terez Mija Parliament suggested that negotiations with the EU should trust him.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative army, announced to the march in Birmingham that the Great Britain would have long been present if Mr. Faraz were the minister of Brexit.
However, the challenge that will be faced by Mrs Mejas, in trying to reconcile her opposing party, demonstrated conservatives who supported the EU's stay and joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to preserve his compromise plan on Britain and the European Union's future relations (Chequers compromise), and to experience attacks from those who want to leave the EU, those who want to stay the EU, and also from the EU itself.
The public said that she would strive to reach agreement with Brussels despite a negative reaction, and would allow the Europeans and leiborists to choose between her offer and the chaos.
Mr. Bouna "Leave Means Leave" said in the village of Solihalla (Solihull) that he wanted to throw out the Meas plan in the middle of the month (to Chuck Chequers).
He offered to make Mr. Pharaoh a friend and to trust him in his dealings with Brussels.
"If he had been on the phone, we would have already left," Bones said.
The Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw out the Meas plan!"
On the basis of his opposition to the EU, he said, "We did not want to be servants!
We want to adopt our laws in our country!"
Mr Bouna ignored the assumption that the public opinion could have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and wish to remain in the EU is absolutely false."
Brexit's supporter Andrea Jenkins also took part in the march, and the reporters said, "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular for our party and for our supporters who actually do all the work and choose us.
Please answer to the Chequers and start listening."
As far as Mea was concerned, she added: "The Prime Minister remains in place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians in the city should feel pressure if they are willing to disregard the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us – people – and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to transfer Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them do it."
In his message, he adds: "I want you to let our politicians, who are planning to transfer Brexit, feel pressure.
"We will call on the citizens of this country, who have enabled us to win the fight for Brexit, and never relax until we achieve that we are independent, autonomous, proud of the United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Palicians traveled through Birmingham before a two - hour residence in the city center.
Unknown activists welcomed conservatives against Brexit banners after a group meeting this week.
The representative of the Workers' Party, Lord Adonis, has made an effort to discuss the issues of security that they had experienced at the beginning of the Party's application conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all their technology for Canada and more, and yet, undiminished, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.

From the time that Walter Bots qualified Saturday before Louis Hamilton became clear that the work of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the competitions.

It was a very bad body language
The president, Donald Tramps, made fun of Senator Diāna Feinstein in the Saturday's residence for her refusal to release a letter from the Christian Bleissian Forum, in which she accused the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking in a town in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the Forda's testimony to the Senate's legal commission, but commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people are "bad, bad and untrustworthy."
"One that can happen and something beautiful that is already happening in the last days in the Senate, when there is anger, when it sees angry, wicked, disobedient and unreliable people," he said.
"When you read the press releases and the leaked information and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer to the question... did you leak the document? "Yes, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we do it...No, we didn't do it," he added, senators in totonate.
A letter was sent to Feinstein in July, explaining in detail what Forda accused Kaveno of, and the content of the letter was expressed at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that it would have happened in her office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Forda's accusations, I'm "declaring" her story, "Finestein told the Commission, reports "The Hill".
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did it too."
But her refusal was not to the president who commented on this situation in his office on Saturday evening: 'I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst language in the body I've ever seen."
In continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, whose three women are accused of sexual harassment, the president proposed that the Democrats use the charges for their own benefit.
"They are targeted to regain power through any means."
Do you see the wickedness, the unhappiness, they don't care what they feel they need to destroy in order to gain power and control," the president said the story "Mediaite".

An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he sacrificed himself so that a plane with hundreds of passengers would safely rise from the ground.

Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini says that one of the people has died after a plane crash in the camp
The airline carried out a flight during which the plane landed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people has been killed, although before it reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the crashing aircraft.
Air Niugini reported on a press release on Saturday afternoon when they could not answer for one of the passengers — the man.
The airline reported that it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find a missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information on passengers, such as their age and nationality.
The locals helped rescue other passengers and services after the plane entered the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were hospitalized.
The airline announced that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, and all of them were in a stable condition.
There are still unclear reasons for the accident and the sequence of events.
The airline and the United States Navy report that the aeroplane is ingested in the lagoon shortly after its departure from the runway.
Some of them felt that the length of the runway had been reassessed.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the crash plane using emergency exits, since the water was only up to the fork.
He said that he was panicking, and that he had a mild headache.
U.S. Navy mariners working nearby to improve the ship’s landing also helped rescue operations using an inflated ship to deliver people to the shore about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water before the plane crashed.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in the last 20 years in the PNG registered airlines, none of them related to Air Niugini.
Commentary on psychoanalysis explains the course of events at night in which life was burned by a woman
On Saturday, the complaint provided evidence in a repeated case in which the man was accused of burning a live woman in 2014.
Commentary on psychoanalysis by the U.S. Department of Justice, Pols Rovlets demonstrated for several hours as a witness expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the information he received on the phone to gather together how the 29 - year - old accused Quinton Tellis and 19 - year - old Jessica Chambers were doing the night she died.
Rovlets said he had received location data from several phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers in the evening of her death, arguing his previous testimony, reported "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his phone was at the time of Chambers, when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sandford, the police went to interview Sandford.
Sanford said that he was not in the city that day at the courthouse.
When the prosecution asked if Telly was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he "was lying because my car was in Nechville."
Another mistake was that Telly said that she knew Chambers only about two weeks after she died.
Phone records show that they only know each other for weeks.
Rovlet said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis would delete the messages, calls and contact information from Chambers.
"He will wipe him out of his life," said Heil.
It is expected that the defences will provide their concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that same day.

It's black again?
In New York, a couple were sued for dismissal after receiving "hazardous" news.
In New York, a couple complained to the court about discriminatory dismissal after she got the wrong message sent from the mother who complained that the wolf "is still in the dark."
Couples refuse to be racist, comparing the trial trial to "press."
Lindsia Plasko-Flasman, a mother of two children, expressed her rejection of the fact that the new baby care provider, Gizele Maurissa, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
"In the housekeepers, ALKAL MELNAIS," Plasko-Flasman wrote to his husband in a short time.
However, she sent the message not to her husband, but to Maurice, twice as well.
In spite of his inaction, the "sumulsus" Plasko-Flacsman dismissed Maurice, pointing out that his previous cold, African-American, had done a bad job and that she was waiting for the Filipinos to return to New York Post.
Maurice paid for her one day of work and sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice has appealed to the courts for compensation and wants to receive $350 a day for six months for work with a secure residence, which he originally applied for, and without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things don't work," she said on Friday "Post," adding "I know it's discrimination."
Some reject the accusation that they are racist, claiming that the termination of Maurice’s employment was a reasonable decision, for they feared that they would not be able to trust her once she was offended.
"My wife sent her what she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joels Plasko, husband, said "Post."
"But, would you trust your children to whom you were treated like fools, even if it was only because of a mistake?
Your babysitter?
But think about it."
The court's sittings compared to "pressuring", Plasko said that his wife had been born a little just two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"Are you really looking at something like this?
It is not an acceptable action," the investment banker added.
As long as judicial proceedings are still taking place, the public’s views quickly go to court over social networks, denying them their behaviour and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Padington’s book were concerned that readers would not be able to associate with a talking bear
Bonda's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was confirmed, said about the letter: "It's hard to "put in a basket", which reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very surprising now to know what we know about the great success of Padington."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator of BBC before he felt the inspiration to write a book to children about small toys, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book was "sweet-sweet-sweet" after his father’s departure last year.
Speaking of Padington, whom she calls "very important family member", her father quietly boasted about his potential success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and not great," she said.
"But because Padington was so real to him, it was like having a child who achieves something: you were proud even if you didn't do it yourself.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all the merit to Padington himself."
I had to leave my dying daughter by phone
After her arrival, her daughter was taken to the hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"Ned called regularly and said it was very bad and expected that she would not live," said Ednana-Laperuza.
"Then I received a call from Ned, saying that she would die within two minutes and I had to leave her.
And I did.
I said, "But, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine she received in order to keep her heart working slowly ended and left her body.
She would've died even faster and it's all over now.
I had to sit down and wait for it to happen.
I could not enjoy or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and people around me.
I needed a lot of power to control."
After all, then she was already a loss-making girl, and Ednan-Laperuza was picked up on the plane with other passengers who had no feelings even for whom she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head turned upside down and my tears flowed all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but right on the flight, I felt deep compassion for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Pregnant women attach cards to bridges to prevent suicides
Two women, whose love for humans has led to suicide, act to help others avoid taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfria strengthen the cards at the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
David’s son, Taylor, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want a parent to experience what I have every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said that her son had a promising dream with a dependent smile.
"Everyone recognized him after a laugh.
Everyone always said that his smile "lighted" always and everywhere."
But he refused work before he died, because he was "slow, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about the consequences."
Davis created cards, "to make it known that there are people to whom you can cut and talk, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to sit down quietly - you have to talk."
Hamfria, who has been a friend of Davies for many years, lost her husband, Mark, for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He did not say that he would feel sad or depressed or that he would feel depressed or otherwise," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude has changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning, when the children opened gifts he did not make eye contact with them or something like that."
Her death was a great injury to children, but they had to end it: "It's a family bond.
That's what we're dealing with.
But we must all continue and fight."

Breta Kaveno's future in the air because the FBI is launching an investigation
"I think that if we could really get what he requires - in a limited investigation of time and volume - we could achieve little consensus," Fleiks said Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the Commission was "participating" between the hard-hit participants' entry.
Why do the supporters of Caveno and his Republics not want the FBI to carry out the investigation?
Their withdrawal is only a coincidence.
Interference is five weeks later, on November 6, if the Republicans are expected to suffer, then their attempts will be much weaker to elect the highest court man from among them.
George V. Bush called the senators in lobbying them to support Caveno, who worked in the White House during Bush and thanks him to meet his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 seats now belong to the Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kaveno can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pens, Vice-President, to vote and approve him in the Supreme Court.
Kima management "reduced" number of North Korean political asylum seekers
North Korean political asylum seekers in South Korea have decreased since Kim Jongs came back to power seven years, the South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Integration of South Korea, said that last year, 1127 asylum seekers were compared to 2011, when their number was 2706.
Park said that stricter border control of North Korea and China and high human smuggling rates are the main factors.
Pyongyang has not submitted any public comments.
The majority of asylum seekers from North Korea at the end of North Korea are offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them go through China, which has the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the severely protected Demilitarisation Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China's political asylum seekers are considered illegal immigrants and are being deported under pressure.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which remain technically war, have improved considerably over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delayed denouncing negotiations.
This took place after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Tramp and Kim Yongun in Singapore, when they agreed to work together to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for no progress since these negotiations.
"If there is no confidence in the US, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will never be the first to unravel unilaterally," Ri said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York."
Nensia Pelosi calls Bret Kaveno "historic" and claims that he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
The Court's minority leader Nensija Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno "historic" and claimed that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made comments during the interview on Saturday "Texas Tribune Festival" in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if the woman had acted like this, they would call him "historic," Pelosi said about his reaction to the testimony given to the Senate's judicial commission on Thursday.
The café emotionally dismissed charges of sexual harassment by Dr. Christianina Blaisija Ford, both of whom were teenagers.
In his initial argument, Caveno was very emotional, sometimes almost shaking and sneezing, talking about his family and high school years.
He, in particular, condemned the democracies in the Commission, calling against their accusations of "the destruction of a graceful and harmonious nature", organised by liberals who are angry that Hilaria Clinton lost his 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that the Caveno evidence was the reason that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed that he had a bilateral attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with such claims and attitudes as he is addressing Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when she was asked if she would try to question the Caveno if it was approved and if the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so - if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the existing court," Pelosi said.
Kaveno, at present, is a judge in the Court of Appeal of Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, Kaveno has been disappointed by the possibility of taking decisions against the "Affordable Care Act" or Roe v. Veids because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation negotiations, Kaveno questioned whether he would reject the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"It is not a good time to work in court with a historical and two-faced person, but we would expect to say joyfully: 'Is that not wonderful?' said Pelosi.
But women have to keep their hands.
It is a denunciation, months and years all fell "by the side", but she is not allowed to take it all away from herself to cry out.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinema told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's something unusual, what do you think?"
She went on to say, "Sometimes a woman who was the leader of a company who said that she was also crying when she was angry, but created a technique – when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, "You can think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was great."
As a form of anger discharge, the Assyrians are recognised only partially because they are understood on their own grounds.
One of my most vivid memories is from an old job where I had a man’s share when I was one of the most angry people I ever had when I was being beaten by a woman who was a distraught old woman, a woman who was always a bit afraid of me, who dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see that cry!" she told me.
"They don't know you've moved.
They think you're sick and they're just glad you're able to "get under your skin."
Patrizia Šrēdere, then a Congressman of the U.S. Democrats from Colorado, worked with Gerry Hart at his election as president of the campaign.
In 1987, when Hartt, who was engaged in foreign affairs, left the ship, also called "the making of fools" and resigned from the elections, Šreedere, was deeply disappointed, considering that there was no reason why she could not run for the presidency.
"It was not a carefully thought-out decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"The election was already seven other candidates and the last one they wanted to meet again.
There were those who called it "Snow White and Seven Shoes."
She was late in the campaign, her retirement fund collection, and promised that she would not participate in the election unless $2 million was collected.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that many of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, had only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting fired?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her, broke into a system that made it very difficult to collect money and electorate rather than talk to delegates, and angry about sexism — where she was "nominated".
"You would think that I have a breakdown of nerves," Schroeder recalled how the press responded to him.
"You would think that Kleinex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking what they're going to write on my couch.
"She cried."
Why the US-China Trade War Can Be Good for Beijing
The main objections about how the war between the US and China started and until the fight is over, the disagreements between the countries can be favourable in the long term to Beijing, say experts.
US President Donald Trumps issued a first warning at the beginning of this year, taxing the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation started this week with new rates affecting the unit's value of $200 billion (150 billion) and immediately leaving half of the goods exported from the USA from China.
Beijing is also in charge of the US goods worth between $60 billion and the lowest five to ten per cent.
China has announced that it is committed to responding to one US and it is doubtful that the world's second largest economy could be minimised in the near future.
In order to withdraw from Washington, certain requirements should be met, but public worship would be too humiliating for China's President Xi Shi Jinpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its card correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the economies of both countries.
"The fact that a rapid political decision has been taken in Washington or Beijing could create in any of the countries uncontrollable economic conditions that are really more dangerous than previously recognized observers," said Abigail Greis, a researcher in New American Security, focusing on Asia.
Syria is ready to take back refugees, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced.
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country that has been raging for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Valids Almualems said conditions are improving in the country.
"Now the situation on the ground is much more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the territories destroyed by terrorists in their normal state.
There are all the conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to a country they were forced to abandon due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihood.
The UN assumes that from the beginning of the war in 2011, the country has left 5.5 million Syrians.
Six million people still live in the country, and they need humanitarian aid.
Almualems said that the Syrian regime would accept assistance in the restoration of the state.
But he stressed that the State would not accept the help or assistance from countries that helped to promote peace.
European Golf Selection sensational victory in the Raider Cup fight in Paris
The European Golf Championship won the 2018 Raider Cup, overcoming the US Cup with a score of 16.5:10.5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six times in Europe and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe regained its momentum when the team led by Tomas Bjorn acquired 14.5 points needed to cross the US elections.
The U.S. Star Son Michaelson, who had a hard time going through the tournament, entered his T-foots in the water at PAR 3 16th floor, joining the match Francesko Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari played in all its stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever won 5-0-0 results since 1979, when the tournament is played in the current format.
American Jordan Spytt lost European teams with 5 to 4 sensationally, after rating, the lowest player Torbjornam Olesen from Denmark.
World's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Eight Raider's Casual Veteran, Spanish Serhio Garcia, became a tournament the best player from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"Of course I don't cry, but today I can't manage tears."
This was a tough year.
I am grateful from the heart to Thomas that he exalted me and trusted me.
I'm very, very happy that we've recovered the cup.
This is the team's merit and I am glad that I could help," Garcia said emotionally after the European election victory.
He goes on to give a word to his people, John Rama, who won the U.S. Gulf legend Taiger Woods on Sunday with 2 to 1.
"The pride I felt when winning the Taiger Woods, I grew up following the course of this player," said 23 years old Rams.
Vods lost all his four matches in France and now he has a career record with 13-21-3 in the Raider case.
The statistics are inconceivable to one of the best players of all time, who won the 14th-level golf tournaments, being the second behind Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent all week fighting to find their advantages, with the exception of Patrick Ried, Justin Tomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf tournament throughout the tournament.
U.S. election captain Jim Furick said after his team's unsatisfying performance, "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we were able to create a small pressure on the European team.
We fought.
All due respect for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the US PGA and the US Raider War Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to get your hats on.
We've won."

The latest report from the FWC refers to the overall reduction of the red space concentration in the area of the Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, donor boards have been reported in Pinel, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which indicate a decrease in concentration.
The red landscape blooms about 130 miles from the North-Pintel to the South Sea Line.
The plots are located about 10 miles from Hilsboro (Hillsborough) coastal areas, but in some places they last for about a week.
The red landscape is also appreciated in the Pasco area.
In the last week, average concentrations were reported in the Pinela area or its coastal zone, low to high concentrations in the maritime area of Hilsboro, low to high concentrations in the Manat area, low to high concentrations in the Sarasota area or its coastal area, low to medium concentrations in the Charlotte area, low to high concentrations in the Lee area or in its coastal area, and low concentrations in the Colj area.
There are still reports of respiratory irritation in the areas of Pines, Manats, Sarasotas, Li and Kolje.
Last week there was no reported irritation of the respiratory system in North-West Florida.
