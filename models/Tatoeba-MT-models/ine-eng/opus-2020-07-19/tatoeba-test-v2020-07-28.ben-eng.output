Tom won't win.
Tom thinks you're stupid.
Stop yelling.
He doesn't have to finish anything.
Do you have any bigger stuff?
I thought this book was interesting.
I don't know the answer.
I love to go.
I don't want to go with you.
I'll be back in three weeks.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
What does "Tatoeba" mean?
Is Tom all right?
I guess I lost my key.
Who sent you?
That woman is under arrest.
Are you all right?
Pakistan is a Muslim country.
Can you understand the French language?
I'll be back in a while.
Tom says he'll give up.
Khan!
Tom's gone.
Children love to do this.
It's too bad for him.
Have you ever done that?
What's it worth?
How many dates today?
Bye.
He was angry.
I agree.
My dad likes pizza.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I wrote a letter.
I like apple.
Didn't you buy it today?
Eat the turkey!
It's not true what you said.
They have two daughters.
Is there anything left for the children?
Come here!
Everyone ignored Tom.
I live in a small village.
Watch Tom.
How much is the price?
Don't look!
We agree.
Tom's gone outside.
How are you?
Tom's playing the guitar really good.
I don't want you.
Do you have my book?
I'll be back later.
Tom Mary ruled.
Don't open it.
Come on in.
Tom's teaching me French.
I'll think of something next to you?
Then there's trouble.
My neighbor's name is Tom Jackson.
I don't know what to say.
Yesterday was my last birthday.
Where are you going, Tom?
I need a treasure lock.
You must have eaten this crayfish.
Who can you take a vacation one day?
I want to change my ticket.
Tom's obviously not happy.
Eat whatever you like.
They all yelled.
It's late.
Let us go.
I didn't get the pressure.
I was a prisoner.
Don't wait.
How long did it take?
It's us.
Why don't you try and get your money back?
Can I see your passport?
I can't find a word.
How can you be so calm?
Eat whatever you want.
Rome in Italy.
Tom is tired.
I can handle it.
When will you come back?
Can you speak French?
I'll never let you do this alone.
That's how it's said, the roof of Mount Everest.
I'm on my way.
Come back.
Tom tried to keep his face up.
Tom's dead.
Tom was crying like a kid.
Let her go.
I can't recognize someone else from one land.
I'm reading your book.
Don't say anything.
He was talking.
Can I eat?
It's a long way from Tom Mary.
The baby's shaking.
I'm asleep.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, nine, one.
And read the book in the evening.
I won.
Take a deep sleep.
I won't waste it.
Good night!
They're all shaking.
There are many branches of science.
No, I'm not, you!
See the bikers and roadmen!
You always accuse me.
For what?
I want to open an account.
When you're on your way back, you're gonna have to cut the ticket.
It's not hard to learn French.
I'm cold.
I bought a pound of meat the other day.
Talk to your mouth!
Everything okay?
Lincoln died in 1865.
We failed.
How many rooms do I have?
He's not here yet.
Find Tom.
I don't want to go with you.
Get out of here, Tom.
The hour of the church has passed.
Let me go.
I accepted her invitation.
They have two twins.
Do you have a car?
You're very brave.
Don't hurt me.
Do you have a bike?
Now the most urgent thing you can do is to be calm.
Where's the shit store?
Look at Tom.
How many nights will you be?
I'm going straight to school.
My throat's a little dry.
I have a new red car.
Thank you.
Watch Tom.
"Why aren't you going?" "Because I don't want to go."
You're not the first person to tell me that.
He's eating.
Tom's in good sleep.
Doesn't work?
He doesn't want to talk about it.
I've learned a lot from you.
Dek me.
Do you have a car?
Do you eat meat?
Is there any other way down there?
No one's doing this.
You're not paying attention.
Can you bring Tom around?
Take this.
Please accept my heartfelt apology.
Do you have something to tell me?
I can't understand you.
Don't eat anything but fruit.
I accepted his invitation.
Is Tom all right?
You're a doctor.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
What are you doing?
There is not enough single language.
Don't move!
They screamed.
My dad's always mad.
Tom wants to catch an empty fish.
He's close.
I love him.
It was important.
Tom closed his eyes.
Where's your stuff?
Tom's been digitizing the Patilebuta.
How many people do you have at your party?
You should sleep.
I want to bring Tom here.
It'll be ten years in April next.
Tom's still alive.
He knows where we are.
What are you doing?
He's a doctor.
You can eat whatever you want.
I've been working as a Winder for three years.
Tom was there.
You run.
Kiss Tom.
We can't sleep for a word.
He can speak French.
I got your letter.
I agree.
Got it.
Tom's not happy about it.
I like her.
You're big.
I don't want to go to sleep.
My mother likes music.
Is this the way to the station?
Do you have a bike?
You always complain.
Do you eat meat?
I'm hurting my lawns.
Can you watch Tom?
Can you play the piano?
Look at Tom.
Today I got a call from Tom.
Listen to me.
I want to buy the anchors.
What is your name?
Don't yell!
This river goes to the Pacific Ocean.
Why are you yelling?
I love to write songs in French.
Tom needs a friend.
Nice to see you again.
How do you expect me to do this alone?
I saw him run.
I don't want to eat now.
Take care of yourself.
I know Tom was your friend.
Stop the scan.
How bad did you see a party in the back?
How am I supposed to go to the airport?
I need a doctor!
Tom's shaking.
Tom, I'm a little busy here.
He's running now.
I just found her house.
I promised you.
That's mine.
We're the winners.
You can eat whatever you want.
I can't find my treasure.
When did Boston train leave?
How deep?
I ran out.
I don't do what he doesn't do.
Here's your bag.
I didn't forget.
We write our own songs.
Are you okay?
I'll do my best not to interrupt your study.
Trust me.
I'm sorry to be late.
He can say whatever he wants.
Were you there?
I know your name.
What's the ticket for the music show?
Tom was talking.
I'm your friend, right?
How long does taxi leave and train station?
Tom will yell.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I'll be back for you in twenty minutes.
What do you want to be?
I accepted his invitation.
What does that mean?
I saw Tom tomorrow night.
You don't understand.
They're all shaking.
Would you please be able to speak slowly?
What's the tooth bothering?
The woman's eating the puru.
Tom wanted you to take it.
I'm done.
My father can fly the plane.
Who doesn't want to win?
He's eating fruit.
Attack!
Tom screamed.
Tom said Mary allowed him to leave quickly.
Is this book Tom?
How long are you!
It's noon.
Don't leave me alone.
Where can I buy stamps from?
I heard a scream.
Are you coming down?
I'm weak.
Tom's been lying about his age for entering the club.
You can stay as long as you want.
He's sleeping like kids.
I didn't see it.
Do you eat meat?
I want to cut my feet.
Don't stop here.
Forgive me, but it's not possible.
I want your opinion.
Your friend needs to remember that.
This item is easily expandable.
Can you please say what you said once?
I fully agree.
You go first.
Take us to the hospital.
I'm not your friend.
He ran.
I lost your phone number.
Get out of here!
Are you going to catch fish with us?
How old was he?
Tom's reading me French.
It seemed easy to see it.
Give me more water.
I love to turn around.
I shouldn't be logged out.
Why?
Tom is very strong in confidence.
I know we still love each other.
Forgive me, I've been waiting for you.
What have you got?
Sit down here.
The hospital is very high.
He's asking how it's possible.
I told them to send another ticket.
I can't believe it!
Tom will talk.
He explained the literal meaning of the phrase.
This is your business.
Read it first.
How old is your father?
I saw my mom's taking some clothes off.
How much have you eaten?
I'm not your friend.
I'm not yelling.
What does that word mean?
Wait outside.
Can you take me to the Grand Hotel?
I don't deny it.
It's a funny puzzle.
They need a friend.
Why aren't you trying to get your money back?
Tom Mary was scared.
If she had followed her doctor's advice, she might still be alive.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom can read French.
Ask Tom.
Don't yell!
What's the next stop?
Why aren't you coming with us?
When I go to the throat, my throat hurts.
I'm dancing.
We often eat together.
He's a doctor.
Is he American?
I'm very tired.
Tom died three days later.
Tom slept on the train.
I'm lost.
He's talking in French.
How much bus?
The meeting is both stable and in the morning.
Call my husband.
The government has fired the hostages.
Tom's with us.
What is your full name?
Tom was playing guitar.
The rule is the rule.
I'll be happy to help you.
Can You Explain?
I don't know if I have time.
How much money does it take to get inside?
I want our full word.
I saw them.
He eats too much.
I'm a free man.
Tom's in there.
How can you be so calm?
The capital of Bangkok Thailand.
Look down.
How old is the world?
Someone's here.
It's starting now.
He's trying.
You might think how I got to know that thing.
Don't stop.
Everyone saw it.
We're here, too.
My name is Emily.
Where can I buy a book?
Do you know what he said?
It's a shame.
I'm playing right now.
Call the hospital.
I can't get my money.
Let me talk to you.
Open the door.
We're here.
Ask Alex.
My father's going to China.
I didn't eat.
Tom's lying.
Don't remind us in any way.
I'll be back in the middle of the night.
Come with me.
Get out of here.
Mary is a sweet girl.
Where is the hospital nearby?
Where's the knife?
That's a hell of a bitch.
I like black.
I trust you.
Do you have any crayfish?
I'm having a good time.
They screamed.
She's asking how it's possible.
I forgot to call her today.
I saw him wash the car.
Tom's out of breath.
It's less than me.
How long have you been in Boston?
How am I supposed to go to the station?
Tom thought the tabiz would save him from the dini's hands.
It's easier to write about death than to write about life to me.
I heard you scream.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Don't leave me alone.
Please eat something.
He hasn't come yet.
My father's home.
Look, there's a bull in the kitchen!
I'm a student.
My dad's open.
I think you both know Tom.
How many nights will you be?
I didn't say anything.
You should ask her for advice.
I'm not a doctor.
They were all shouting.
Who's coming?
Tantari, Tom.
We've moved to South America.
What is your favorite TV program?
They have a gun.
My treasure is in Dickie.
You really don't do anything.
What do you want?
He can say whatever he wants.
How long does it stop?
There's no one there.
You need a friend.
My horse's hurting.
Shut up.
Contact Tom.
I want you to talk to Tom.
I respect the big ones.
Spanish is her mother tongue.
They don't care.
Since when has God’s Kingdom been established in Japan?
Tom's never been so happy.
Don't sing.
They need a friend.
I heard you scream.
Don't eat anything but fruit.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
Watch out!
No man can do this.
I'm all right.
What's your hat?
He can say whatever he wants.
I only have one blanket.
Don't talk to Tom like that.
He's talking.
What language is spoken in the United States?
I read English.
Let us in.
He was speaking.
He hasn't come yet.
Is that your book?
I'm out.
Tom grew up in the forest.
I can't do anything.
Would you like some more?
Seven already run.
I haven't done this for many years.
How much money do you want?
Democracy inspires freedom.
I like my tea.
How much is it worth?
I can kill you.
Tom's got it.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
I can speak in French.
I don't want you to go.
My dad's busy.
Seven already run.
I was in Rome.
Hurry up.
I can put my hands on the ground without a blade.
The police ordered us to follow.
You're a doctor.
Try to be a little calm.
I'm so happy for Tom.
How old is he?
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
Can I get some towels?
It's not always easy to do the right thing.
How long did you leave the airport bus?
He can speak French.
It's your key.
I can't.
A car hit Tom.
What a surprise!
I don't want Tom to see me that way.
He can speak French.
There's a problem with being alone that nobody's talking.
Have you ever gone to Boston?
That's a bad look.
You can study here.
I'll call them when I get back tomorrow.
Come in two hours.
I know Tom is tired.
I want some money.
Tom's dead.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I'll watch.
No one knows me in Boston.
Contact Tom.
It's snowing all night.
Which one is it?
I need a taxi tomorrow night.
I heard you scream.
I don't see you.
I can't understand what you're saying.
How long are you going to sleep?
You have to do something about it.
I'll pay 100 a day.
It's over.
Please wait a moment.
Are you out of your mind?
They're shaking.
Turn left.
I killed Tom.
The library on the left.
What does that word mean?
Mary's shaking.
I teach English.
Eat whatever you like.
There's no doubt about it.
Kids like cake.
Tom Jackson is your real name?
Tom's dead.
Tell me what you need.
I haven't found my contact lenses yet.
Tom's dog was scared.
Tom saw him.
Your bike is like my bike.
Why do you want to leave today?
Sit down.
Drive carefully.
I see TV.
Don't cry.
Tom wanted you to take it.
What have you got?
He told me he was going to Venice.
Listen a little.
Can you trust me?
He's smaller than me.
I don't speak Japanese.
We're both right.
Tom slept outside.
Sit down.
Don't worry about me.
It's over.
What happened?
I agree with you.
How much does it cost?
How can they forget us?
I can understand your situation.
I'm not Tom.
What a joke!
Here's my book.
I'm Tom's wife.
I'm not very busy right now.
Where are you going on Monday?
They're shaking.
Tom Jackson wrote three books.
Tom told me that today.
I don't want to go to Boston.
Your answer is wrong.
I know.
I'm having a little fun.
I'm not proud of it.
Run it.
The train came as soon as we could, so we didn't wait.
I'm not your friend.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Come with me.
Is that your new girlfriend?
You can write in any language, all languages in Tatoeba.
I quit slow, and I don't know why I'm doing anything, and I don't think you're happy.
He can come.
He's an important person.
The train stops at all stations.
I didn't care.
I haven't had a baby.
Where's the mistake?
I can't attend the meeting.
He's a doctor.
I'm going to the next station.
Are you a doctor?
I'm eating now.
You should ask him for advice.
Mark was born in 1991 in Harbot.
My son knows how to watch the clock.
I'm looking for a good hotel.
I'm a woman.
I'll be back in ten hours.
Don't confuse yourself.
I don't want to look at Tom.
He's a doctor.
Bye.
Looks like you're sick.
I want a guitar.
Do I have to save my ass?
Is that blood?
Call me tomorrow.
Wetter, get me some water.
Let's find Tom.
My mother can play a very good piano.
Can you speak French?
We'll eat now.
We win.
I went to Rome.
Please fill in this form.
We've seen it.
I'm glad to see you again.
They don't care.
How old do you want to get married?
It was too late to go to school.
Forgive Tom.
Who would want Tom to get sick?
No one believes in tomorrow.
Let her go.
I'm hopeful.
Tom kept yelling.
How's it going?
He can speak French.
How old is this church?
I want to go back to Australia before my passport expires.
Sit right there.
You can go there.
I don't want to get involved in all this.
How many nights will you have?
Is your husband at home?
It can be Japanese.
Tom's running.
We love coffee.
Let's hear what Tom has to say.
Tom loves me.
What did you forget?
I live here.
Tom cried almost every day.
He broke his room and broke it.
Tom brought it.
I love him.
I'll cook.
Can you please say one more time?
I'll be back in three hours.
I'm yours.
Take Tom to the hospital.
Hold my hand.
How can they forget us?
That's why you don't want to be alone.
Are you going to go to dinner with me?
How old are you?
Don't go to lunch.
Call me tomorrow.
Sit where you want.
Tom doesn't want to hear it.
We're Arabic.
Tom was hurt.
Where are you?
Smile a little.
I lost your phone number.
Everybody's here.
Would you like something to eat?
I can cut the salt.
There's nothing left in the cold.
Nothing happened.
Everybody's lying.
I'm your friend.
Time's up.
Try harder.
Have you ever eaten fish?
He's talking.
I like him.
How long you are!
I did my job.
I want my beard.
I thought so.
I don't like my body.
Wherever he went, his dog followed him.
You're not a doctor?
I saw him run.
Tom's son's name and Mary's daughter's name.
Tom's in trouble, isn't he?
What's your name?
Let's get out of here.
How much is that?
Do what he says.
I think the train's late.
It's over.
I have two classes.
Keep it.
Nobody's talking.
Tom's talking.
I'm sick.
What am I eating?
Get Tom away from me.
What's your father's name?
I want to get some money.
Eat your milk.
The people of Madrid are surprised.
People don't see too many sparrows.
Let me tell you.
Tom Dabba likes it.
I want you to come with me.
Tom Bhuru Bhuko.
Tom was angry.
I don't like my coffee.
Stay here.
Eat the turkey!
I heard you scream.
Call me.
Welcome.
I want to buy some cheese.
Call the doctor!
I'm not worried.
Is this site empty?
We won.
My brother is two years older than me.
Stop!
The hotel was built last year.
Take it all.
I want a guitar.
Stop that woman.
What will you do tomorrow?
Don't talk.
You can write in any language. All languages in Tatoeba are the same.
They're there.
It's her house.
Forty million people speak English as their first language.
This house is hard for me.
Where can I buy food?
Let her go.
I forgot his name.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
Tom was with me all day.
How long do you have to go to the station?
Who ate?
Where can I buy tickets from?
How old is your grandfather?
He can say Japanese.
How much will I live to go to Wikiki?
My feet are hurting.
What is the total number of students?
You can study here.
Tom feels happy and excited to see him.
He's less than me.
Tom likes chocolate cake.
I'll go now.
Have fun.
I was late last night.
Didn't you get cold?
Eat whatever you want.
Don't call me.
Is it far away from here?
Where's the boy?
How long has the train been in New York?
I'm on my way.
I love him.
Do you want to learn French?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
No one understands me.
Let's go.
New country.
He's sleeping like kids.
Can you show me your boarding pass?
Can you please help me?
It's less than me.
The win is never easy.
I'll take care of it.
Do you have time?
I thought you were coming.
Tom's in a good mood.
I'm busy.
You can go home now.
He's less than me.
I think Tom's fine.
I'll be back in Australia in two days.
Tom Mary told her she was going to kill herself, but she wasn't as brave as she was.
Are you going to catch fish with us?
Although it is not bad, in many cases, many watch too much television.
You should ask him for advice.
I'll take him.
I'm cold.
I'm sorry.
I'm still your friend.
I still can't believe I believed Tom.
Be careful.
My son can't count yet.
Take a look at the car.
I'll eat.
I don't want to go on my own.
How far from here is the station?
He got sick at the end of last week.
Tom just knocked on the door, but no one knocked.
He's a doctor.
Stop breathing.
My head's broken.
Go to the hospital.
The angel of God came back.
Please continue the nine.
Pen is broken.
Tom always keeps his word.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I'm denying it.
Wait outside.
I want a cab now.
Shut up.
Who is he?
It happened at least three times.
Tom wants me to go with him.
We'll try again!
Tom is tired.
Don't forget about us.
Tom kept talking.
I'm south of the north.
You're very tired.
Tom was waiting for me all afternoon.
He's eating.
Last week, he got sick and sick.
I'll see you next month.
We need to contact Tom's father's mother.
Where can I buy that paper from?
I'll be back in seven hours.
Is the heart too deep?
I'm late.
Call Tom.
How much is the price?
Tom saw her.
How long is your plane?
Tom is long, but not long as I am.
She's my wife.
I'm not very good at sleeping.
Where's the tour office?
Don't go.
Your shoes are here.
He didn't tell me his name.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Are you here?
What happened?
Home tax is $100.
I'm not very good in France.
My dad's going to China.
Can he speak French?
I want it.
I'm your friend, right?
Help me!
I'll help you.
I don't agree with him.
Call the police!
I was worried.
There's a cup on the table.
I'll be back in an hour.
I have to get off this ship.
It's Tom.
He hasn't come yet.
Kim smiles.
I'm not in town.
Women have changed the world.
Take a break.
I don't want Tom to see me in this state.
Tom started calling.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
It'll cost €30.
Start here.
We were waiting for them.
I like my yellow color.
Tom decided to keep a diary.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I'm not your friend.
How old is he?
Come back.
Why are you yelling?
Can I get a check?
Do you have something bigger?
Tom comes from me.
That's what I need.
I don't think you need any help.
Tom's been waiting outside the gate.
Don't wait.
Is the magic open today?
Don't wait.
Don't worry about me.
Shall we eat outside today?
Get Tom away from me.
Tom's hurt.
He's black.
Are my London clothes made?
Where can I buy it from?
I need to send a fax.
She's eating too much.
He taught me to write.
Call my husband.
I could play that song.
I was surprised.
Where's Boston?
Our Dakis.
The rules are simple.
Can you watch Tom?
You're in a better position than me.
He hasn't arrived yet.
I can't shake my right hand.
I'm in the hospital.
Tom caught the thief.
Tom, I want to talk to Mary.
Can you understand what I'm saying?
Tom, when he heard that Mary had married John, was surprised to see him.
Most success depends on effort.
Tom's very funny.
Tom blew his head off.
Were you born there?
Everyone knows it now.
I got my shoes.
I was surprised.
Are you still on the run?
Do you have a toothbrush?
The contact is offline.
Can I get a knife?
Have you ever broken your bones?
I want to name the next stop.
How are you?
I'll go to the dentist tomorrow.
I can't believe it!
So, what?
He's not here yet.
They're doctors.
Can you understand what I'm saying?
Have you ever rode a horse?
He was talking.
I have two brothers.
What about you?
I had nothing to say to Tom.
Try harder.
Tom smiles.
Why are you sitting there?
What language is spoken in the United States?
I'm tired.
He has two daughters.
I want you to talk to Tom.
I'm your friend.
Follow Tom.
Tom always keeps his word.
He's an experienced teacher.
I think you both know Tom.
Tom here.
Everyone wants happiness.
I forgot your phone number.
Tom's gone.
You're tired, aren't you?

I don't know if I'll have time to do this.
Tom's keeping his word.
I want you to call Tom.
Tom bought some light.
Tom's gone.
You go first.
We've had dinner all night.
School will begin tomorrow.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not waiting.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Which one is it?
A soccer game.
The sky is clear.
Mildness!
I'm really celebrating your generosity.
He told me he was going to Venice.
What's your phone number?
He's moving.
What does this sign mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Wait here.
Have I been too late?
Let her go.
I can't say right.
Language is a means of communication.
Tom knows that.
I've never heard of Tom like that.
How long will the next train be left for Tokyo?
Tom's taking a big risk.
Are they yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Are you going to America next month?
I don't want to go to sleep.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He hasn't come yet.
I'm sorry!
You want me to tell you how much I want to say.
The snow reflects the excessive lightning.
Get out.
They screamed.
I ran away from home.
We made a pancake for the Empire.
Don't you have a bike?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're shouting.
He's Kaslen.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Everyone saw it.
I'll give my baby food in the morning and in the morning.
My son came to my house.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your passport?
Please just give me my speech.
Do what he says.
You're so tired of it.
Tom started screaming.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always pays attention to her.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We've seen them.
This is June 18th and this is the birthday of Muriel.
Who won?
Come on, let's get ready.
We have to tell empty Tom to do this, don't we?
Can I get these clothes in hysterical condition?
I'm going to Osaka Station.
I don't think Tom is responsible for it.
Someone's a nightmare.
I went to the market.
I learned to live without him.
My dad's very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.
Tom was very busy with the job.
I'm not proud of the way I used it.
I'm sorry.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm shaking.
My hand-to-hand is not working properly.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is this Tom's book?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could have died.
Are you sure?
We have to go now.
He's out of his mind.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He's just got his head warmed.
Wherever he went, his dog followed him.
Who's this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
It's my desire to stockpile old bottles.
I like the score.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
Don't you have a bike?
Do you want to come?
My mom can play very good golf.
He knows where we are.
I know your name.
Tom's not here anymore.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped screaming.
How old is Tom?
Come quickly!
Stop breathing.
Was Tom there?
I'm bleeding this afternoon.
My back's still hurting.
Where's Tom?
They seem to be American.
You were Tom's only friend.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted her invitation.
My father can drive a very good car.
I'll be alone.
You need a friend.
Forget Tom.
I think Tom said his name is Jackson.
You've known Tom for a lot of days.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My treasure hasn't arrived yet.
Tom hasn't come here yet.
Please wait until he arrives.
Tom doesn't pay much attention to him.
There's something to eat.
Is there anyone in the house?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's fine.
Where can I get the stamp?
I'm going to pee.
Can he speak French?
Tom might want to take that.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
A little more nibby?
One more day, it's gone.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Stop that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where do I claim my money?
We do what we want.
Tommy's right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is for students who don't speak Japanese.
Tom wanted to be the minister.
Who will you believe?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I deserve.
No one is indispensable.
Are you here?
Everyone else laughed.
How many nights will you stay?
Did you see the guy in this picture?
I've lost my money.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake Tom up.
My son's getting the money.
The sky seems to be starting to snow tonight.
How much will it cost?
You know exactly what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop Kashi.
I want Tom to be happy.
Those who live in a brick house should not throw stones away.
Why are you shouting?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to the hospital.
Tom wants his umbrella back.
Is Tom in the house?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'm having a nightmare.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city was divided by a river east and west.
Let's see for yourself.
Do you understand what he says?
I have to go to sleep.
Do you have a car?
Tomo's playing guitar.
Do you have any idea what you're going to do now?
He's running now.
Can you watch Tom?
You should ask her for advice.
This tooth is hurting.
How much do these lights do?
How much should you give for extra money?
Everyone liked Tom.
What happened here?
Here's your key.
Are you Japanese?
Take a break.
Eat whatever you like.
Take this.
Have you ever broken your bones?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't climb my right leg.
I'm thirsty.
How old are you?
Can I ask you a question?
What's that?
Here's your key.
We've seen worse things.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What's that?
He's eating.
Korgosh Gazer likes it.
You don't understand.
My mother's hurting.
Sit on the table.
He's smaller than me.
What is your name?
We were waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use a credit card?
It's a big night, isn't it?
This book can only be found in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I afford a credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went to Jackson's house.
He was wearing a black hat.
Anything else?
Everybody cheers.
Is there anything left for the students?
I'm eating noodles.
Tom's in the house.
Don't ask how they are, ask what they're doing.
Will you come inside?
I'm telling you.
We like football.
Will you eat?
Good evening.
He's eating empty fruit.
I want new shoes for these shoes.
Everyone liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Enjoy.
Please listen!
He's running.
Tomorrow's rain, but I'm gonna go get some sleep.
My right leg is hurting.
My father was busy.
Ready for everyone to go.
I couldn't catch the 7,000 train.
There were two of his daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's talk.
Do you have a pan?
The class doesn't start before the first eight.
How long have you had the chain?
What does that word mean?
How much can I get?
Can you speak English?
What they did was wrong.
My son is far away from me.
Tom's father-in-law was a singer.
Here you go.
Tom's alive.
He's showing her in the fax.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was angry.
How much is it worth?
You can eat as much as you want.
Let go.
I'm a little hot.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Fill in.
How old are you?
Get Tom.
They're shaking.
You're shouting.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
I'll be back when I'm done.
I like the light.
He grew up in France.
He didn't work on Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
Three men were killed.
Don't eat anything but fruit.
Tom's dad's safe.
Hey.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
Now's the time.
I never make a mistake.
Where's the door to the UA 111?
I'm stuck.
Why are you whispering?
Tom wants his umbrella back.
How much time do you normally spend listening?
The country has signed an agreement between itself.
I'm talking to Tom in an empty French language.
Tom's eyes are dead.
Can you give it to a little gift?
Tom's in the garage now.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's smiling.
He hasn't come yet.
It's not mine.
Who's here?
He's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The terrorists left the prisoners.
I could go with you, but I didn't have time.
I lost my manbag.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government has fired the hostages.
Let go of the city!
Replace 3rd with 3rd.
He's eating.
How old is that church?
Let's go!
It can be Japanese.
Did you see him grow up?
How much did the shuttle bus leave for the airport?
Don't argue.
That's my dick.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got a stroke.
We were on our feet.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom yelled.
Tom's in a very low mood.
Just do what you want.
Tom's crying.
How much is it worth?
I'm fine.
They're doctors.
The plane arrived at the right time.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the viewers were busy.
Turn right.
Tom's probably sleeping.
I've had a lot of trouble.
Tom's been running a lot.
He knows where we are.
I learned a lot from Tom.
Tom the lights are dusting.
They were all shouting.
I'll stay outside.
My mother can cook well.
They're shaking.
The investigation was successful.
I don't think Tom's gonna be able to keep the gold he's got.
Boston is a big city.
I'm 17.
Here's your key.
Leave Tom alone.
Eat your milk.
The name of the two of us is Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the flesh?
Tom's hurt.
Follow Tom.
Is Tom still mad at me?
Tom's gone.
We were waiting for you.
I'm not drunk.
Do you know what he said?
Listen to me.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you shouting?
What's your father's name?
Look over here.
I'll tell you what to do.
We tried.
Tom left in October.
The market is next to the doctor's office.
Happy Canada Day!
I'll be late.
What does this sign mean?
Tom blew his head off.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's blue annars.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen carefully.
Are you going to go to dinner with me?
Take it easy.
They're there.
I'm sick.
Everybody's clean.
Don't hurt me.
Who was it?
I'm Lajuk.
When I said that Mary left town, Tom was really surprised to see him.
I heard a scream.
How long is your plane?
I don't want to talk about it.
My book seemed attractive.
Tell me what happened.
I got up at 8:00 today.
Please light the light.
Tom was hurt.
I'm still your friend.
It took me two hours to translate some pages into English.
Are those yours?
Who is he?
Is this a small road to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
What are you doing to her?
It's impossible!
How long is Yokohama coming?
How bad now?
Words that don't correct the correct ones, you can get more normal translations instead.
Your shoes are here.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to cook for you.
Listen, is this train going to Washington Square?
We failed.
There's ACE in this house.
Did you follow the whole thing?
Tom Boston was gone.
Clean it up.
Don't open it.
Tom saw him.
Night may snow.
I'm not proud of it.
Is there anyone there?
It's wrong.
I'm not young anymore.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Will you take the fish with us?
Wait right here.
I'll be back in twenty minutes.
One minute.
Tom got hurt.
Mary explained.
I don't deny it.
You don't see!
Do it as quickly as possible.
Use it.
How long is Yokohama coming?
I don't understand that either.
I've been up for seven hours this morning.
I'm home.
Take it easy.
Good afternoon!
I'm inside.
Me, too.
I'm not very busy.
That's great.
Do it again!
Tom's starting to fall.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to go."
I know that.
I'll be close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
My feet are hurting.
Ask Tom.
I'm thinking about what I'm going to give you on your birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Nice to see you again.
Why are you shouting?
Stay right there.
Eat whatever you like.
We were playing the park.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy tickets from?
I'm done.
I'm planning on staying at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started screaming.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom happy.
Don't go inside.
We're lost.
Tom's shaking.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm looking empty, thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We were waiting for them.
How old do you think I am?
Tom's not happy here.
She was angry.
I don't like coffee.
Talk more slowly.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to see Tom?
Here you go.
We don't do what he doesn't do.
I called my best friend Tom.
We can never play better than that.
We're cowards.
Bill's gonna be in the meeting today.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's not right.
Have what you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
