Anrainers were called upon not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant at the shore of the river, additives are produced for lubricants. The factory belongs to Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffet and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.
In the work, about 400 people are working. In the past, the chemical factory has already made sure that the gas methanthil was developed by a leak in 2013 and that the environment is wide-ranging according to faulal eggs. In 2015, after an operation, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flow into the city's water system.
Woman announces her job to look for her missing dog for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog and announced her job extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie was taken away from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days missed every trace of the dog - but Carol King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got hurt," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had put the dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere else in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says: "She's gone about four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately released. Probably a loud dog had moved the dog into panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But from days to days they were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flow"
57 days after Katies disappearing, Carole King received a call: A man reported that Katie was in his court. But when the king arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She searched for her neighbor and suddenly stood her dog under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled according to "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flowed. People kept in their vehicles, walked out and hugged us. I thought the whole neighbor knew we had found her."
Losses in the Federal Defence: Machine gun missing without trace
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In the past years, the German defence has lost many weapons and tens of thousands of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The rest is unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "fearing" extent.
In the Federal War, weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again - many of them have been undetected. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons and nearly 20,000 ammunition. This is reflected in a closed list of the Federal Ministry of Defence, which reports on the German editorial network.
According to the paper from the Office of Defence Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon and 3474 ammunition have been reappeared. The remaining weapons and weapons are six MG3, eleven G3, four G36 weapons, six G36 signal guns and two P8 guns. In addition, 30 MG3 machine guns are missing.
The extent of weapons and ammunition losses in the federal defence was "fearsome," said left-wing Federal Agent Martina Renner. This is so much more true, since in the course of investigations, there was hardly anything found. The left-wing politician spoke of a "good balance". The runner criticised that the list was not recognizable, whether under the missing ammunition was those who were found in connection with investigations against the Federal Defence Officer Franco A. who was suspected of terrorism. "And although a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaving Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As observed by Refinitiv, the tanker moved and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was reported as a destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but he remained in Iranian waters for the first time. From the shipyard it was said that one wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was launched on 19 July by the Iranian revolutional gardens in the sea road of Hormuz under the pretext to have violated security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran would react to the controversial, temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tanker before the Gibraltar of Great Britain.
The road of Hormuz is one of the world's most important sea routes. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil export is shipped by the seamen. The tensions in the region have intensified greatly over the past months. Trade shipping has been brought into conflict between the United States and Iran.
Merkel values the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the commitment of the people in the DDR, who went on the road 30 years ago in the Peace Revolution. In autumn 1989 courageous citizens had brought the DDR regime into check, Merkel said at a celebration of the Thuringian CDU party on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the establishment of the Stasi Centre. "The state security was taken away from the horrors," she said.
Musk seeks delivery record
Teslas Quartal may keep record. Despite the issue boom, there was last loss in the electric car company.
New York.Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost to the stock exchange with the view of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musks Rundschrifben. The challenge was to bring the cars to the knowledge quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible for the quarter end.
The investors liked it: Tesla shares went with a plus of over six percent of the trade. The course has been so strong for almost four months. Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs a record in order to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, in the current and next quarter of the year, there are six-digit figures. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are few gains. Despite the boom, there have been losses.
Solved puzzle: That's why we can't kick ourselves
A type of brake in the big brain prevents people from kicking themselves. This was found by scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments at rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress was also made on the question why children were so strongly opposed to the kicking, just to ask for more.
Finally, it also showed why the closeness of a kicking hand has already triggered a laugh before the touch. This lies at a deep layer in the big brain, which already triggers the laugh in the expectation of the kicking.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats with "Laughter" react in the ultrasonic area when they are kicked by humans. This "Laughter" will be transmitted by the part of the large brain that serves the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-esteem
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can differ between self-breeding and touching by others - so that people can not kill themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out in the experiments at the rats that the laugh is as much as the activity of the area of the large brain is suppressed during a self-breeding process. This is also true if life is self-absorbing. During the alienation and killing by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and impulse has been reinforced.
But pass through the self-touching and touch through others at the same time, the laugh is also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat can't just between the self-touching and the touch by other different ones. The new findings made it clear that people can't kill themselves because the self-touching activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats were also trained to kill themselves. Thus, they dropped this initiative in the experiment sometimes early, showed flight behavior or horror star. This ambivalentity is equal to the behavior of the children. The ambivalentity of the kitzels is a behavioral reaction that is equal to rats and humans.
Disaster dismissed: Large fire in French chemical work deleted
The large fire in a chemical plant that is particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen was removed. This was shared by the prefecture of the Normandy of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire was broken out at night on Thursday.
According to the authorities, no health-threatening substances should occur. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the event. The firearm was in use with about 200 extinguishers.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were called up not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to Lubrizol of US billion Warren Buffett
The chemical plant at the edge of the lake produces additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffet and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.
In the past, the chemical factory has already provided the gas methanthil from a leak in 2013 and the environment is far from faulent eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2000 litres of mineral oil flow into the city's sewage system.
Brexit: Johnson criticised by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at Parliament's first meeting after the break-in on Wednesday night. The Prime Minister threatened to lead the country without an EU agreement on 31 October, but Brussels should not comply with its demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement.
About Cox, who was used for the rest of the UK in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and to re-unite this country would be to complete the EU withdrawal." Cox was murdered in 2016 during the referendum election by a right-wing extremist.
Most of the attacks by Oslo and Utöya are being revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a mammoth is revealed on Saturday in Norway to honor the victims. The monument "Jerner Roses" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of some 1,000 iron roses. They remember the roses that thousands of people had placed in Oslo in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Dom.
At the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be revealed – the roses were smiled at by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims. For the opening of the Crown Princess Haakon and the Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected.
On 22 July 2011, Anders Behring Breivik first fired a car bomb in Oslo's government district and, in connection with the Utöya Island, dozens of participants in a youth holiday camp of the Socialist Workers' Party were killed.
Iran frees British tankers
The UN General debate did not solve the Iran conflict, but there is a smaller problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" in Iran was able to land again in the sea. It could be a puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tank "Stena Impero" on the road of Hormus in Iran since mid-July is back in international waters. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as reported by the Reederei Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the Crew is now going for medical examinations to Dubai, Reederreichef Erik Hånell explained. On Wednesday, the ship left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told the Swedish TV SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London referred to the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the sea. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian revolutional gardens had set the tanker on 19 July under the pretext to have ignored the rules of sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members went well according to the circumstances, Hånell said. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and exciting situation in the past ten weeks.
Following the establishment of the "Stena Impero", the British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: at the beginning of July there was a super tanker with oil from Iran, which was intended to have been placed on the chain for Syria.
The Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Mutt measures, it was an exchange business to get the "Stena Impero" released, as London was very much back.
The road of Hormus is one of the world's most important sea routes. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world's oil exports are shipped by the seamen. The tensions in the region have greatly intensified in the past months. Trade shipping has been brought into conflict between the United States and Iran.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear struggle between the two countries. The Americans are putting the Iranian leadership forward to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The United States entered into the international nuclear agreement in 2018 alone to prevent Iran from building an atom bomb and to end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country under pressure to force a more stringent and extended agreement on other areas. Iran still resists the pressure.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for military protection of commercial ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace on the road to Hormus at the UN Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Calition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign defence forces, wants to ensure the security of the Persian Gulf.
India builds a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
In view of the criminal charges imposed by President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, India is forced to re-disposition foreign producers in the People's Republic. Financial heads of Asian companies considering placing their production from China in another country call India in a survey of the UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This is not only to play a more important role in the instability of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India appears to be created in the global chain of production.
But now India itself has reached Trump's focus. From the Haudegen in the Weissen House to the "Kingdom of Customs", America has removed the commercial advantages for 2000 products from the threshold country at the beginning of June. In the United States, India maintains a prohibitive high tariff and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirit cars, motorcycles and more.
On the World Map of Trade Wars, the tires with India are freely a sideshow. In addition, America considers the world's largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington connects concern over China's claims of power in the South American Ocean. Against this background, a Salve of American criminal charges against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just arrived at a second five-year term, should therefore move safely.
The problem lies elsewhere: The empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult position in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under fashion. Its reformer focuses mainly on the bureaucratic irresponsibility, which has long been stifled by any entrepreneurial spirit in the country. Companies now receive faster building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more aggressive insolvency and competition law makes it possible to liquidate high debt companies.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the appropriate rankings. From economic perspective, much has been improved in India in the first five mode years. However, in trade policy, this is not the case. In addition, the national conservative government has decided to protect internationally less competitive companies from foreign suppliers, even creating new barriers.
In the West, the mode of the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, which has been radically renewed in his country. This impression is not due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister is only too well-known, which the western Vocabulary managers like. But in the core, the "India First" advocate never deviated from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to escape anachronist races and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive due to the removal of their industries are among the root voters of Modes nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and emphasize this short-term policy.
Application of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is scheduled to present a report in Paris next week. On Monday, the former head of state was booked at the Friedhof Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported calling the Chiracs family. The order will take place in the close family circle. For Sunday a public mourning party was set up in Paris’s invalidity, as media reported.
The competitor's goal is: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Light Athletics-WM
The world’s tip was long in the goal of playing hot-hot scenes in the under-cold Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5,000 meters, Jonathan Busby began to move dangerously from Aruba. He could hardly stand on his legs 300 meters before the goal, when Braima Suncar Dabo suddenly stopped him from West African country Guinea-Bissau and supported him in the last half of the stadium. However, the forces were still able to stop after the finish of the race. As the scene had not been long enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was completely unexpected the attention of the gathered journalists. Fearing he only didn't want to talk about his heroism at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a companion of suffering. And without that, he would only be proud to represent his country which was invited to the World Federation. Under normal circumstances he would not have been allowed to start. "Therefore I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did so in the evening with a repression - and much more intense than he would have thought of it. For this herotat will remain in memory. At the same time Dabo's rival busby even took the lead in the goal and voluntarily took the last place - in addition to five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega won this foreword. It had enjoyed nothing at the end, because the busby only came to the goal with a lot of help was disqualified by the end of the world's light athletics association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and is studying there in Lisbon, was present to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data at 18:10,87 minutes, he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. In 18 minutes I was already once". However, only in training, there are no best times.
MILLION MACHINE: Egypt is preparing for a wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been reinforced in advance of possible government critical protests. In the center of Cairo, an enhanced police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
Already in the past days the police had strengthened their street controls and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos in connection with the protests. Hundreds were said to have been arrested by two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend it was in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. They directed themselves against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. Such an open protest against political leadership had not been given in Egypt for years. The Egyptian construction contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who brought the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for this Friday to be a "million march" in central places in the country. Ali calls for a "Volks Revolution". The man is also not a "gooder for most young Egyptians, because he as a sub-contractor for the armies, has called for his messages.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise by two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECSR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these numbers were not confirmed. The government also confirmed and did not comment on the numbers.
Voluntary arrests
Many people were "willfully arrested", "only because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time at the wrong time", HRW informed the detainees in calling for legal counsel. The objections against the detainees are based on the statements of their lawyers from "dissemination of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces were questioned and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW-data, also voluntarily passengers.
HRW also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Thus the government blocks in Cairo websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online Dealer: Dealers should be able to make returns easier
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost. Around 20 million returns land on the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online traders such as Amazon and Zalando how they can spend returned products instead of destroying them.
Although companies could not be released from the turnover tax on Sachsen, the Ministry explained a question of the Green Party's report on the Funke Media Group's newspapers on Friday, but the traders could use the market value of the unsold returns so low that they would not have to pay any or only a small amount of turnover tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg found that the federal citizens were returning every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - then landed in the mine. They would also cost the companies, according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate fees as a turnover that then affects the turnover tax.
Green Group Chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with an explanation that companies could not evaluate products that were not sold to non-profit organisations at the same time and could not afford them free of charge. The companies had to be able to rely on this, not to be penalised for donations. This applies not only to online trade, but also to other business from model to construction.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be expanded.
For Branchik, Banksy's work underlines "the re-education of the oldest parliamentary democracy of the world into the basic maintenance of animals and tribes".From Saturday, the painting at Sotheby's in the UK capital will be exhibited until it is increased on 3 October. It will be estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the southwest of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had re-issued the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29th. On this occasion the work, which was called the "Fragest hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The image could change the owner for a million.
Last Wednesday, at the first meeting of the Sub-House following the abolition of a forced pause by the Supreme Court, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had provided a hard exchange with the opposition. Johnson wanted to complete the already moved Brexit twice on 31 October without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted an image that represents a man who deals with a milestone of the European flag. The work sees thousands of Lkw passengers and other visitors daily when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The fierce verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit-Gender in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hate in his view. In comparison with the fight against the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy was a "walking in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy it. We will (from the EU) stand out and we will win".
Mr Johnson had taken a firm stand in Parliament over the past few days and had cast them at the people, among other things, on charges that he could put the Members in danger, because they could become a target of murder, he turned down as a "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to restore peace was if the Members of the British would finally respect the decision to withdraw from the EU, and it was not surprising that the people were concerned that Britain was still not leaving the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the above-mentioned mood, on Friday even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint. "We should speak with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen".
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for uno-attacks in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the UN Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India was likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN General Assembly in New York. "If this is bad, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have been responsible for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
Since its independence from British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have led three wars, two of which have been divided around the Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers each control a part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August, India had removed the Indian Kashmir region's autonomy status and thereby significantly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the storm of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It can shoot with sharp ammunition on the population, over 2000 prisoners join the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protestants were never safe in Egypt. However, since the takeover of power by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario as at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, impoverishment and the feeling of being stabbed by their own government driven millions on the road. And this is a problem that also does not get the regime of el-Sisi in the grip, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who he is financed: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the biggest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and many more. It was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically, it will always be when a large part of the population have difficulties at all to drink a bottle of water.
Tuv tests in the terminal: BER-Chief: No more "showstopper" for main city airports
Two months have been examined whether the complex plant body works in conjunction with BER brand protection. Operators are satisfied with the course. However, the tube is not finished at BER.
Following major typhoid tests in the terminal of the future main city airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, Supervisor General Rainer Bretschneider said after a meeting of the Control Board.
Chief of Airport Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there are still shortcomings to be dealt with in the terminal. "We have many detailed themes, but we don't have a real showstopper". He assured that the schedule until the start of the operation includes buffers.
However, there is evidence that the temporary reserve should no longer be too large. The production notice should now be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this fall at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of defects in power cables are still to be fixed; the tuv wants to examine them until February. "To create the conditions for taking up the flight operation, it is still necessary to work intensively on processing the deficiencies," said a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is missing evidence, less new cable. There is also no release for all doubles to which the cable tracks are linked. The captain expects it to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection is still not satisfactory at the crossing to the station below the terminal. The problems had led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking cuts that go down on a fire like a linen wall so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. 36 engines therefore have to be replaced. Then there is a new attempt with hot gas at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other trees and planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was due to go into operation in 2011. The cost has increased from two billion since the beginning of 2006 to around 6.5 billion euros expected to be opened next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the managers plan to expand the airport. That is why it should go to a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as announced by the President Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Finance chief Heike Fölster changes at the end of the year to the German railway, personnel chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen goes to Rente next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster.
Chemnitz: Automated for Drugs - Police Takes Stand
He needed money for drugs - and he hunted several machines in the Chemnitzer city area into the air! Now the killer is finally in jail!
In the past two years, the number of sprayed cigarette and parking machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen dramatically.
After two detonations at the end of May, the police arrested a 33-year-old German at the Civil Street and at the Further Street in Chemnitz.
Police spokesperson Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations of the conduct of explosive explosions in Tathenes together with a particularly serious case of theft carried out by the Chemnitzer Criminal Police, this suspicion was not only confirmed against the 33-year-olds".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer was now a total of eight.
The police spokesperson: "With the benefits he has apparently financed his addiction to pollution". Only four times the bomber had hit parking slots on the streets between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage is at least EUR 60,000!
The automatic bomb is now under investigation. Police investigations against it continue.
It is assumed that he was also responsible for further automatic voltages in Chemnitz and adjacent country circles.
AUA takes Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is revising its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the middle of the price struggle with airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa's daughter AUA "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed on Friday a press speaker from Austrian Airlines against the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on this.
The Vienna base of Eurowings' Lufthansa ticket flights is thus de facto dissolved. Four of the current seven Eurowings flights remain in Vienna. This takes over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetleas", including Eurowings staff. Three Eurowings jets to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines will be stationed in Salzburg. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA network crossing and network planning, the speakers explained. The flight times are intended to be aligned with connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the Vienna network crossing and, on the other hand, to expand the decentralized transport from the Federal Republic of Germany.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna are still only "production Company" for the AUA Group Sisters. This would include Barcelona and Rome with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings devices. The board product is intended to be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants are derived from Eurowings. Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number will not be reported any more in Terminal 1, but as the AUA in Terminal 3.
At the airport of Vienna, a price struggle broke out after Niki Square. The Ryanair daughter Laudmotion announced only on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna was to land on 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish airline sends four Ryanair machines as well as crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlea", which the trade union criticised as an environmental structure for collective contracts.
The campaign by Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary that Lauda has been overrun for five years was won on Friday UAA CEO Andreas Otto: "We remain number one in place, in five, six or ten years".
Queen-One Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is married!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) was to hold the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31).
"We are extremely happy to be able to announce our commitment. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be married," the couple, who has been together since October 2018, told us in the official communication.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that in the years to come, love and happiness will help us very much."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have been posted on her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding will take place in 2020. Further information on date, place and everything else will be announced in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the story of the number nine of the British thrones and the real estate mogul will be a similar big party like the mourning of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for heart-circuit disorders. But what really solves a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to see the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to find out more details about the causes of heart disease.
The research project was the largest of this type in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) shared on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davos University Clinic, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich participates.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the essential risk factors for heart-circuit disorders. Genetic factors determine the risk. But the interaction between genes and external influences is only known, it was said. Now scientists want to compare the complete heritage of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients at the University of Heart and Gastrointestinal at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-induced changes of the DNA - called mutations - were known, it was called from the clinic. Each year, about 200 come in.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart problems, heart failure and heart disease. The data could also be useful in the investigation of other folk diseases, so Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University of Heart and Gastrointestinal Centre. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a strong will to use the data to investigate other diseases. The Foundation's clinic in Davos has been dealing with allergies. Now, at the medical campus there, a centre for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created and a professor of bioinformatics should be created. For the sake of his commitment, the logistics contractor in Switzerland said that he had been operating in the open heart three years ago and was very grateful.
The bio samples of healthy participants are derived from hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 samples, according to the clinic, this is the world's largest local health study. In the case of inheritance encryption, strictly considered the protection of anonymous data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
Today, UKE’s heritage can be deciphered within 24 hours. The pure costs of sequencing are estimated at 1300 euros. The first generation sequencer, whose results were published in 2001, has still cost several hundred million euros. The study will start on 1 October, at the end of 2020, all 9000 samples will be analysed. The first results will be expected in the year.
Nigerian Police Freed Hundreds of Untreated Boys
In Nigeria, the police released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Korean school. According to residents, security forces searched for the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, as police spokesperson Yakubu Sabo reported, in part, "The victims were abused. Some of them refused to be raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught in the Koran and "injured". In fact, the shields were held by their teachers under "the most reprehensible and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. About one hundred students, including children at the age of nine, were placed in a small room.
The Koran School has been in line with the data for about ten years. The authorities had been paying attention to repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents had been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school, said Sabo. They had not been aware of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In most Muslim northern Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often lacking state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Relief Agency, therefore, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighbouring Niger in the past ten months.
Caught and tortured: Nigeria Police Released 400 Children from School
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria have freed nearly 400 students from violent conditions. "Many of them were harassed and some of them had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
The children were discovered there on Thursday after a notice in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "human". The officials took the school leader and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all young men, were held in their school like slaves and placed in chains. Some were sexually abused. TV images showed debased and injured students in a clearly bad health condition.
World Football Selection: Other projections by Messis and Klopps Kür
Invalid signature
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Mesi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association features the best player, the best players and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Mesi it is the sixth honour and thus record.
After Nicaragua’s Captain declared that he had never voted in the World Football election, submissions from other countries to the Fifa came from other countries. Egypt was not valued at all - with a very good reason.
Many of the Fifa's actions have proved to be inconceivable in recent years: the WM grants, the dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. The Fifa World Football election has so far not been in doubt about whether or not to go out of the way - if one sees that the qualified national trainers and national team members of the member associations vote more often in accordance with sympathies than in an objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua had already complained that he had not voted at all, further irregularities are now increasing: Egypt complained that the voices of National Coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly unanimous vote review.
The Fifa apologizes for the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms have been given in capital letters and therefore not valid". They have contacted the Egyptian Association several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan Trainer also amazed
There is also a call from the Sudan regarding the election. While the case in the case of Egypt is clear, the Sudanese association states that Coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not agree as it was finally assessed: with Lionel Mesi on the spot one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was just as taken, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan football club had just voted in his name. In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan football club had voted in his name.
From Friday the report came on Friday: Yes, but of course it was not intentional. The filled election papers were "irresolutely" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan election, it was in a communication of the association. However, he chose the second captain Manuel Rosas. "We take responsibility for the error of administration", said the report. Rosas as well as the team coach Henry Duarte, however, had voted for the exhibition, "just as it is in the official list of FIFAs".
The other cases now allow the Fifa to examine in an investigation, but stresses that the election process was supervised by the consulting company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Lionel Messi remains the only uncontested winner of the World Football Election - and Jürgen Klop World Coach of the year.
Ukraine-Affaires: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans spoke openly for an official investigation against US presidents and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this comes from, it will be determined by the facts that will be established." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affairs before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the President's resignation.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. They had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott observed Trump Biden "for years".
The Republicans have so far remained critical of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, only a few have found distasteful. Scott's statements are now the first sign of this in Trump's party. Virginia's moderate governor had already turned himself against Trump's policy, for example against the lockdown of environmental regulations and the strengthening of immigration regulations.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right course and responsibility for the congress is now to investigate the matter and to go to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as Governor of the United States, have not formally taken part in the procedure against Trump, which will be decided on at the Congress. Their statements are therefore of particular symbolic importance. However, the first senators of the Republicans have also been critical of the situation. In the middle of Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case is "extremely disruptive, deeply disruptive". US media also reports that the first rise among the Republicans internally.
The affair could lead to the introduction of an anti-Tramp procedure, which the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, and they have proposed to him abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the recruitment process. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment. But the decision on a actual post collection fell in the Senate, where Trump Republicans have the majority. The prospects for the success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board rockets "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Sicily, they were to have raped and killed in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rocket (31) was arrested in June after she had been on board on board with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now, new heavy pretensions against rockets are being sounded. In this way, three men who have been subjected to torture in Libyan refugee camps have arrived with the "Sea Watch 3" in Italy. Suspects have been captured in a recording camp in Messina (Cisilia) after migrants have recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We can't rule out this, but we don't even have any secure information," said the "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben Neubauer of the German Press Agency.
From the police it was said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped, raped and even killed. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and brutalized - through repeated and persistent physical violence," it was then mentioned in the communication.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. "We cannot scan who are the people. They come without passports," said New Buildinger. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. Therefore, it is likely that there are also terrorists on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this will be followed".
Italian Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini once again called for an apology from rockets which are still being found in Italy because of aid for illegal immigration.
Musk seeks delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost to the stock exchange with a view to new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk Rundschrifben. The challenge was to bring the cars to the knowledge quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible for the quarter end.
The investors liked it: Tesla shares went with a plus of over six percent of the trade. The course has been so strong for almost four months. Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs a record to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit numbers are required in the current and next quarter year. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are the few gains. Despite the boom, there have been losses.
US budget dispute: Renews only a bridge financing
The new financial year will start in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives and decided on a transitional funding until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is facing a new fiscal year beginning on 1 October once more without spending plans. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives and decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision it would have come on Monday afternoon to a Shutdown, a partial closure of the Federal Administration. President Trump has yet to come into force.
Shutdown aborted
The federal administration is now temporarily funded at the level and in line with the priorities of the spending plans for the end of the year 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to meet the 12 expenditure laws in time to allocate funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot benefit from the new budget year from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio.
Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the representative's house, where they have the majority. However, the laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the republican-dominated Senate. The Senate has also prepared ten of the twelve plans for spending more or less, which are hardly majority-qualified.
The spirits differ mainly on the issue of resource allocation for the field of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are obviously trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall to be one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats are at odds with the construction plans and their financing, which are actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The fight over the construction of the wall was already staged in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
On the wall building, the spirits separate
It is now unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. Probably more than agreeing on all twelve expenditure laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of transitional funding beyond 21 November. Also, a shutdown is not excluded.
In the light of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve expenditure laws in time, and thus the inherent danger of a Shutdown will win ideas for the automation of the process of popularity. template S. 1877 for the prevention of Shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the Federal Administration at the level of the previous year, suspend the travel activities of Parliamentarians and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans are proposed.
France allows artificial breeding for lesbians and singles
In France, the artificial breeding of women and lesbians is expected to be open in the future: the Paris National Assembly agreed by a large majority on a government bill, after which all women can apply for in vitro breeding, so that the demand for anonymous coexistence could increase significantly.
The presentation also required the Senate's approval. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that many "children without fathers" could grow up in the future. Also, the French Bishop's Conference is against innovation.
The new system is the core component of a bioethics law, which Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as "the chance" for society. It is the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her presentation, the costs of artificial conceptions for all women are to be borne by social insurance.
Fertility with Sperma of dead husband further prohibited
However, with a limited majority, the National Assembly withdrew an amendment which should give widows access to the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artificial fertilization "post-mortem" is permitted. In Germany, there were cases in the past, in which women were allegedly complaining about the issue of the sperm of a deceased person.
On the other hand, many members of the Government party La República en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had spoken out for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be "double mourning" if her husband's wish to remain unsatisfied by the death of her husband was still fulfilled.
The initiators of the proposed amendment now find it unfair that a widow can be fertilized in the future with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with her own partner.
So far, artificial breeding in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot bear witness. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzin had already announced in the summer that the maternity leave continues to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples, however, it is often difficult.
Remuneration for the climate: Call for flight for Unis becomes louder
A lot is flown to colleges, and that's why the country wants to have a climate tax in the future. The rectors say they don't have any money for it. But now they're also under pressure.
The schools should also be limited when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Street School
The discussion, which took place before the summer break on climate change on flights from universities and universities, is resounding. After the country director conference had responded skeptically to a corresponding advance from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctors of six Bath-Württemberg universities and a Pedagogical University advocated for compensation of services. This was a first step "necessary", at the same time there was to be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, in their opinion.
Russia again adopts North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the prisoners were to fish illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. At that time there was a firefight between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered his serious injuries. But this time there were no injured persons, it was said.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian high-level waters. There the Russian Coast Guard will carry their own information to protect their marine biological resources Patrolen.
30,000 ink-fish seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 inkfish were discovered and seized on the boats. In addition, the data were seized after three fishing and two motorboats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia's Fisheries Authority has also issued no fishing licences to North Koreans after complaints of domestic entrepreneurs this year. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been caught there, according to the media this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the remote Primorje region, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished closely synthetic nets prohibited with Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply worry in the sea where they would need 200 years to be set up.
In the future, only 18,000: USA lowers asylum ceiling
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country of the earth is shielding itself from protection seekers: As confirmed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington, the upper limit for the legal access of refugees will be further reduced.
The US government wants to reduce the historically low threshold for the admission of new refugees again. In the 2020 economic year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, there will be a maximum of 18,000 people in the country, as stated by the US Foreign Ministry. In the almost recent economic year, the limit is still up to 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has dramatically reduced the reception readiness for protection seekers from all over the world over the past years. Barack Obama has had far higher reception limits under the pre-government of Barack Obama.
The declared ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. Refugee Programme in 1980. However, the U.S. Foreign Ministry referred to the United States as "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the use of the official U.S. president.
A "responsive approach" with refugees is intended to enable refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of commitment from supporters, but there are also massive criticisms.
A major point of dispute is the border to Mexico that wants to narrow down the Trump. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had suspended the national emergency. Whether there is a temporary link between the current measure and the current internal policy developments in the U.S. capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selensky affair and a possible threat of office recovery.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their belief - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are therefore in danger, as indicated by the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the other hand, there should be a maximum of 1500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The United States wants to achieve that, in particular, people from this "Northern Triangle" of Central America apply for asylum in other countries. In this regard, the United States has only signed with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras Migration Agreements to prevent migration to Mexico at the US South.
Court ordered release of orange-utan from zoo
An orange-utan weibchen has been placed on the request of the Argentine justice from the former Buenos Aires zoo into a detention station for human beings in the United States. The "sandra" born in 1986 in Rostocker Zoo has been promised the rights of a "non-human person" and therefore its release is mandatory. The animal was taken on Thursday night by direct flight to Dallas, however not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human waste is not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, they will live in Florida in the future in the freeness of the Centre for Great Apes. There are already 21 more oranges and 31 chimps, among them "Bubbles", former pets of Popstar Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, Sandra has yet to undergo a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent several years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-zoo in Gelsenkirchen before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" fundamental rights imposed by animal rangers in 2014 has contributed to the conversion of the zoo of Buenos Aires into an eco park. By 2023 a research and education site will be created to preserve biodiversity.
Record for Swiss Extremberger: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Extremberger Dani Arnold has won a new home ride in the Italian Alps at the nearly 3,000 meters high.
Without net, double floor or other auxiliaries, the Swiss forced the 550-metre north wall of the Great Zenin in a new record time.
Dressed with Jeans, T-Shirt and only supported by absolute freedom of movement Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise. Thus he provided the old best brand for almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important northern European walls.
Nike benefits from a new online marketing strategy
In spite of the trade conflict with China, the US sports producer Nike has booked a significant profit surplus. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars in the last quarter (about 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as announced by the Group on Tuesday. In particular, the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly turns to its customers online.
In the three-month period, sales increased to $10.7 billion by the end of August. The most powerful sales of Nike added a plus of 22 percent in China. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited in the People's Republic of Oregon from its approach to address consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financier Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to pursue the "digital transformation" of the sports article manufacturer with strategic investments and thus increase its competitive advantage. The investors responded with a positive response to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports article manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban for racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about the football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the capital of Italy has banned a lifelong stadium ban against a fan. The defender of Brazil Jesus was ridiculed by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasrom you already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToracism. pride on being who I am," wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted on the late Thursday. He reported on the fan's account with Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma supporters will never visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Rassism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly scandalous Italian fans racist attacks against black players rivaling teams. "We cannot have any racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. One has to identify and throw out of the stadiums," Fifa President Gianni Infantino said on the weekend. The occasion of the speech were racist songs at the first party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on Sunday.
However, there have been discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities now have 38 random fans of record-master Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them may no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed them. For the rest, bans of four to seven years were therefore applicable.
Fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups in the area of Juventus. The twelve are proposed, among other things, heavy repression, money laundering and private violence. The club had brought the investigations into play with an ad last year.
The ultra-directors are supposed to stick behind the black trade with tickets after Italian media reports. They would have "military controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and would have forced young people to come to more affordable maps.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millenials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - all the years are considered with griquel names. If you look more closely, the awards are filled with contradictions. How well do these labels describe the respective sense of life of young people?
"The Krabs come!" With this call officially launched the opening of the Krabs at the Gucheng-see in Gaochun on 21 September, which also launched the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department of Public Works of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern exit of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has in ecological terms ideal conditions with a mix of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to be rich.
In the early 1990s, people in Gaochun had already begun to suffer from cancer. In the course of the time, the cancer industry has developed into an attractive sector that provided high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In the past years, Gaochun has actively engaged in a large, ecological and scientific development of cancer cancer as well as in a technically supported cancer disease, and the city has taken care of the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has developed a reform to "distribution of power, optimization of administration and services" and with care the service network for "authorisations under a roof, a criminal prosecution team, a network for services, a platform for credit granting". Thus the city wants to optimise the environment for approvals, services and development.
Gaochun creates the benefits of connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui fully and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as an outpost, to promote intelligent high-end production plants, biomedical and environmental technologies, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors, as well as from the Gaochun countryside, which are leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all-area tourist zone and foreign transport sites of national importance. The ecological and cultural resources of the countryside of Gaochun, including the state of the land of Gaochun, have been involved in the construction of the buildings of tourism and tourism on the one side of the world's affairs and on the other side of the world.
Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged offer by the United States of America to abolish sanctions.In contrast to talks with Tehran's leadership, Ruhani explained on his official website.
But US President Donald Trump opposed the Iranian official on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had insisted that a meeting be held. "And America says I am lifting the sanctions," Ruhani added. The kind of criminal measures to be completed stood for the debate. "And they have clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions".
However, this advance was not made in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticised. In view of the existing criminal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China was that the Islamic Republic should refrain from developing nuclear weapons. France President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel on the edge of the UN Assembly, expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquakes near Istanbul - Almost 200 remnants
After the western Turkey was shaken within a short time by two earthquakes, fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the day before, there have been nearly 200 survivors, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This will increase the worry of a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. The earthquake of the strength of 5.8 on Thursday had destroyed the Marmara region before Istanbul and triggered panic in the millions of metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for bees, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imaglolu said. In the city itself, the latent danger is always ignored. Every year poorly built houses are being torn into pieces - among other things made of mortar by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly spew Istanbul.
City planners like the famous architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas registered in the centre as a resort have been built for a long time. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Golcük baby in August the building engineering chamber of Istanbul had warned that estimated a million buildings in Istanbul would not be more land-based.
The epicenter of the baby from Thursday was located in the Marmarameer in front of the district of Silivri and about seven kilometres deep, as the disaster protection authority Afad reported. A smaller legacy provided a few minutes later for even greater panic on the streets.
The Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was initially not reported on Twitter, injured or injured. The state-sponsored TRT showed people who panicked from the houses. Students were brought to the Silivri district for security reasons from the buildings. Some students were crying as they were seeing pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmarameer, there is a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder that marks the border between the Euroasian and the Anatolic Earth Plate. Turkey is repeatedly threatened by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the slaughter in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of 7.1 to 7.4 might threaten. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. On Thursday, the earthquake hit the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags with all the needs packed up next to the door, and schools bring children to their senses when the earth wakes up. When the next big bets come, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people were injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu persecuted the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom).
Warning to passersby in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users of panic are reporting. Buildings were clouded. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Phone lines were interrupted. It was stronger than Tuesday, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Clinic, warned by Twitter about accidents. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The date of birth is given according to official data at 13.59 (place time). Only a few minutes after the first birth there was a copy of CNN Turkey, which was given with a force of 4.0 on the right scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 has affected the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter has been located in the Marmarame west of the millions of metropolis, the disaster protection authority Abad already shared on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that took care of hit lines on that Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later it could come to a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually get rid of it - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy estimates that the Earthquake is now a warning. It is more likely that this will lead to CNN Turk. "These may be signs of a larger earthquake," says Ersoy to the broadcaster. "Before or after the great quake will also come".
Just a few weeks ago, there had been an emergency - the bee caused great anxiety even in Istanbul. In Albania, there had been only a few days ago a severe earthquake - there were 68 injured. Even at the bottom sea this year, the land had been buried.
Parliament: New Firearms in Ukraine
Two striking documents provide new firearms in Ukraine's affairs for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible recruitment process, the US Democrats are strengthened: The complaint about Trump submitted by an anonymous notifier and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian President raises important points for investigations against the President. Trump himself sees himself as a victim of a "Hexenjagd". He also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
United States: Airports from United Airlines in Toilet Closed - Airports surrounded
Since a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a United Airlines flight was conducted. The toilet door was blocked during the flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, according to US media.
In an unplanned interim landing at midnight (placetime) in Denver, the woman was finally able to be released from the narrow cabin. For about an hour she had been locked in there, US media wrote calling on other passengers. To continue the flight towards San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video distributed on the Internet, which is supposed to come from flight 1554, it is to see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are working at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We will get you out soon, OK?" says one man. The airline apologized to all the passengers. It was open first if the woman gets compensation.
The cake lake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is undetectable.
Ian McEwan (71) was inspired by Franz Kafkas' famous story "The Change" by British success author Ian McEwan, who wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in Britain.
The Roman "Die Kakerlake" (original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27th, the Diogenes publisher (Zürich) shared with him. This is about the conversion of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now on one occasion is the most powerful man in the United Kingdom. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people in fact and is willing to let nothing and no one stop.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "When the Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged in a critical moment, when ministers lie as the Soviet leader, when Brexiters in high positions just ignore the disaster of a no deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write." From McEwan was only published in the spring of the Roman "machines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafkas 1915 is the first story published by Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and looks "turned into an unforgivable stranger" and is excluded from family and society and is finally based. "Ian McEwan refuses to describe a world that stands in the head," said Diogenes publisher.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austrian railway infrastructure
11200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive fluorescent brakes to reduce the noise load by freight trains. Furthermore, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authority, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure top "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travels to October 31st
The German travel agent Thomas Cook has one day cancelled all travels until 31 October 2019, after his insolvency request. Travels could not be affected "on insolvency grounds", the company announced on Thursday night.
This includes bookings made by Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOURS, Booker Travel and Air Marine, which are already paid or paid in full. As it stands for travel starting on November 1, 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the other procedures will be examined, it was said.
Thomas Cook, in Germany, had arrived in the court of the British parent company and had applied for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann travels, Öger Tours and Booker travels, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Securer wants to transfer hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday hotels abroad, which are still staying Thomas Cook holiday, are expected to receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, the payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that vacationers are no longer required to extra payments.
Based on booking information and without any particular invoices, hotels in the holiday resorts should now receive 50 per cent of the outstanding payments, as a Zrich speaker of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and subject to the condition that Thomas-Cook travellers from these hotels will not be required from now on for individual payment of hotel bills or otherwise," said Bernd Engelien.
As a result, the insurance responded to reports of hotel guests who were forced to pay their own accommodation on site. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Consumers Association had severely criticised this.
As many hotels are affected, it will be agreed on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, said the insurance speaker. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook holidaymakers were still traveling from Germany. Zurich Germany has insured the holiday and return of Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvent administrators want to try to continue three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the payments announced now to hotels by Zurich Insurance help only travellers who are still on their way. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly the holiday only, it seems bad. On the late Thursday evening, the company announced that all travels would be cancelled until 31 October. This applies also to such bookings that are already paid.
As it stands for travel starting from November 1, 2019, the company opened. In accordance with the insolvency insurance, the other procedures will be examined, it said. In principle, insurance is also responsible for these cases Zrich. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurance company Zrich, which can be represented by Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of the return of the travel price and apply a web form to their claims.
Prince Harry destroyed Sprunkmines in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana's engagement. In Africa he is now turning directly to his mother's trails.
The British Prince Harry in Angola, dressed in a blue splitter protection vest, has burned and destroyed a bomb mine.
Close to a British Halo Trust camp near Dirico, he set up the seal ring on Friday morning before the ongoing TV camera. In a safe distance, the explosive bodies exploded in the Savanna landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the bloody conflict in the African country for decades, there are still more than 1,000 mines that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly to the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same bomb master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go back the way she was going. The pictures on which Princess Diana 1997 went through a spacious mine field had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Standing Brexit negotiations: the danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he would not be guaranteed a third suspension of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements in the polarising British have been made for a long time. The latest judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain floats like a Damokle value over the Blondschopf. His suspension of Parliament in order to be able to hold its Brexit course until the date of departure was cancelled. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to carry out an extension of bilateral negotiations with the EU until 31 October. However, Johnson had categorically again excluded.
Boris Johnson still holds a deal for possible
However, the pressure does not seem to go through Johnson. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he indicated that he would support an extension of the negotiations in the event of a disagreement by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by October 31.
And best of all, with a deal, I'm cautiously optimistic that it works.
The time of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels is all the same. About six weeks later, the EU and the British retailers have time to prevent a withdrawal of Britain from the European Union without agreements. However, the recent talks have not yet been completed. An agreement by the end of October is now more difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a new shift of the date of withdrawal is in force. However, the opposition is not in favour of the Prime Minister's words. You fear Johnson could somehow implement the Brexit in the case of a no-deal.
US authorities: Other deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. Furthermore, there are confirmed and probable injuries in the meantime 805, the US health authority reported CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, more than 900 people have already been affected, about 500 of whom have been confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still quite unclear. In Europe there is no similar increase in lung damage. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the USA.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of times, the videos of Mohammed Ali were shared in online networks. The construction company and actors living in Spain are calling for a "Volksrevolution". For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military who are criticizing corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass media coverage with a million participants in central places of the country.
The security authorities are alarmed in any case. In the centre of Cairo there was already an enhanced police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. In the past days the police had strengthened their street controls and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests.
On 20 September the demonstrators gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend it came to protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. Such an open protest had not occurred in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces responded. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW) Human Rights Organization (HRW), many of them were arrested almost 2000 people since last week. Many of them were voluntarily arrested - only because they were "for wrong time in the wrong place", HRW reported under appeal to prisoners' lawyers.
The organization also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Therefore, the government is blocking Cairo websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after he had silenced the democratically elected Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially convicted in the past years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs von Greenland-Expedition back
The Polarforscher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. He was welcomed at his arrival in the port of Hamburg, among other things by the skipper Boris Herrmann, climate activist Greta Thunberg with the Rennjacht "Malicia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has been investigating and documenting the effects of global warming on his ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement was a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He waited for years to report to the young generation. He knew for decades that the earth would warm up. However, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place outside the public," Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the flood of the sea. In the expedition, among other things, a dry Greenlandic glacier was measured and fished with nets for microplastics.
For his "fighting for the sustainable and respectful use of the world's seas", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the framework of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us, whose survival of the oceans lies in the heart, Arved Fuchs is a great example," Skipper Boris Herrmann said at the award. "He is a witness of the changes that have been made in the Arctic in the past decades."
Teure Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists pay for noodles 430 Euros
430 Euros for two teller spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from England in Rome: That seemed too much to two Japanese tourists. The bill included 80 Euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the departure on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases harm the reputation of Rome. We ask the police to examine whether this is a fraud," asked a speaker from Federgit, the Association of Travelers in Rome, according to the Roman daily newspaper Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
Prompt came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. Also, a drink money of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything's broken? US President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with an official survey procedure after the turbulent discoveries of the past days, which the Democrats want to examine with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks to weeks until a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is likely to stand on the ground. The proposal of the Whistleblower, who has taken care of the debate on national security and the democracy of the United States with his last complaint, is a monster: the President has misused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the 2020 election. He has used Ukraine's dependence on it to force them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be reflected in the currently published signature of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not give back the full wording. But the phone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the centre next to Trump is primarily his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes from public view in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giulianis' travel plans are reported to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are good. "We do not mix in an election, we join in an investigation where we have the right," he says the newspaper. It may be inappropriate, but "that is not illegal". Giuliani wants to be followed in Ukraine by investigations for which there is hardly a basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my clients and could be an aid to my government."
The lawyer and former New York Mayor seem to have been infected with right-wing fantasies that were fixed on Trump's opponent at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had co-operated with actors in Ukraine, critics said at that time to construct an occasion for Russia's submissions in the USA. However, this proposal was never taken seriously.
It is precisely the investigations about the trump on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giulianis and the President says: the former Vice President and the candidates for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, have been forced as Ukraine's deputy director of the Obama government to disband the former Ukrainian State Attorney General, Viktor Schokin, and, in order to stop the investigation of the gas company responsible for him, his son Hunter Biden was active in his supervisory board. Both seniors have pushed Ukraine financially to neglect the corrupt machinities of his family.
In fact, the outcome was somewhat different. When Joe Biden asked the Ukrainian attorney general to go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Shokin was himself subjected to a highly corrupt charge, the US government was not the only Western partner at the time who forced his release. In the other case, Obama's government even explicitly supported the investigations against the company.
Disorders on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances on Instagram and Facebook. Thus, mainly Germany, Britain and Spain are affected. On the site all disorders.de reports users that Facebook has not been charging since around 15.30. Instagram reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disturbance, even if it is not the same.
Instagram and co. frequently affected by disturbances
It's not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July the services were out for several hours. And as in previous cases, users also go back to Twitter this time in order to make their angry air.
Polish Scientists Saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on their way with a hose boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue screwdriver for the rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Force:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the message, about ten minutes ago, and we were on the boat for 20 minutes."
Poland has been operating on King George Island since 1977, the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers have certainly been brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NO wireless charging
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
As recently as several new smartphones have come to the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - all in front of the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to call once again a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature sets the battery to
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. This is according to the findings of the University of Warwick, which is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly larger heat development. If you load a normal cell by cable, the battery heats up within three hours to 27 degrees. In the case of wireless charging, the researchers have measured the smartphone on the charger even more than 30 degrees. If the phone is slightly near the coil, the temperature is even higher. Furthermore, the watt strength of the charger is also increasing, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a crucial factor. As each grade plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only needs capacity, but it also does not last for so long. The life expectancy is therefore lower. The researchers therefore advises that the smartphone is always charging via cable. Since a battery exchange is always connected to modern smartphones at high costs, it should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of an battery exchange - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technique is extremely comfortable: Simply put the device on a suitable charging path - these are already already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery will be charged without a lax cable salad and a difficult plug-in foam. Since Qi (which is used for inductive energy transmission) is a global standard, with exception even Apple, there are few restrictions. However, the technology should be used only in exceptional cases, according to researchers.
Everest-Stau-photograph: 13 thousands in six months
A Nepalese mountain climb has reached 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world, according to its own data. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, his expedition organizer shared with him.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 thousands in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He already made international lines of strike: From him comes a photo of mountain climbers who stand on Mount Everest snakes in the spring.
The picture of the mass attack triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and the highest peaks of the earth. Within less days, eleven climbers died at the climb.
A problem for Purja could become the rise of the 14th thousandth: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is called bad weather, among other things. At the beginning of the week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a portable elephant cow, a police spokesman told us on Friday. "We assume the elephants were poisoned."
The four cadres were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited earlier rock festival Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
On Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The killers are often farmers, in which the animals had previously been unharmed. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants each year. This is usually the case when the animals move around their living space.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. Their killing is theoretically the death penalty.
Contained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after it is established by Iran. According to the IRNA news agency, this was announced by the Bandar Abbas Seafarts Office. The Iranian revolutional gardens had set the tanker running under the British flag on July 19th under the pretext that the law of the sea should have ignored the rules in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook's Management in Criticism
The competent Economic Committee of the Sub-House wants to examine the Board of Traveller Thomas Cook in full. It should go on the Board’s cost package as well as on the question why the British government did not want to make financial progress for the companies struggling with survival. “Our interest in the company is as much as in the control of external auditors”, said Chairman Rachel Reeves in London. “We obviously have to do it with a bad example of management.”
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the increased family risk of colon cancer has been apparently overestimated so far. To this end, researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come in a current study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are therefore probably more difficult than ever. This has had consequences for calculations of individual colon cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
This was written by Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (placetime) by the industry blog "Electrek". The request was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued to be called in Musks Rundschrifben.
The challenge was to bring the cars to the knowledge quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
The investors felt the information: Tesla shares went with a plus of over six percent of the trade. The course has not been awarded for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95'000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs a record in order to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, in the current and next quarter, six-digit numbers have to be produced. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are few gains. Despite the booms, there have been losses.
Will the British government deal with Brexit Act?
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for an unregulated Brexit in order to enforce the legislation that Parliament has recently passed, and on a question that he said only on Friday before journalists, his government will remain in force.
The law provides that the government must apply for a shift of the withdrawal deadline, should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law", which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, British Prime Minister John Major expressed his suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political shifts" to enforce the law. Johnson could use a procedural string that would move the law into force at the time of the EU withdrawal.
Johnson said he is seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Iran conducts apparent uranium enrichment high
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has raised the pressure on the European Contracting Parties in the fight against the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "The European States, however, show inability or lack of readiness when it comes to concrete actions," Rohani said on Thursday at a press conference on the edge of the UN Assembly in New York. In the case they do not stand up to their promises, he presented "more steps" away from the agreements of the difficult negotiated agreement of 2015.
The conflict is a background to the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which has been a counter-performance undertaking to normalise Tehran’s economic relations. In 2018, the United States entered into the agreement to force Iran to change its course into an aggressively perceived neighbourhood policy. President Donald Trump’s government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher orders and is now relaunching harsh sanctions against Tehran. Iran has recently reacted to this with a resumption of its limited uranium enrichment.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or at least prepared Uranium for use in the beginning of September. According to the IAEA data, Iran is also preparing for the construction of more than 300 additional centrifuges.
The Europeans may not be ready to carry their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of pressing US sanctions, which Rohani had to do. However, there will be further talks that hopefully provide a solution.
Rohani continues to dispute Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US estimate that Tehran was responsible for the attack. The Huthi rebels, originally supported by Iran in Yemen, were known for the attack, which was valued by the United States as a false confession. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such charges must present evidence for this," Rohani said. The European leaders in the talks with him during the UN General Assembly had not been able to do so. Instead, they had only called upon the rebels in Yemen to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the extensive sanctions of the US administration had to be lifted, Rohani demanded. He urged the government in Washington to shift to a policy of "dialogue and understanding".
Comet of Other Star Crossed Solar System
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This came first. The comet allows feedbacks to other solar systems.
What was initially only a suspicion is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was baptized after its discovery on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The longest comet was discovered on August 30, by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory on Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters diameter. Observations of various observatorys not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object that was seen after 1I/'Ouumamua of 2017 during a journey of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get insights into a foreign solar system before it disappears at all. The first observations show that the interstellar comet resembles our own system, as reported by the Canadian Astrophysical Institute. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometres per hour, which in this distance is clearly above the typical speeds of objects surrounding the sun," said David Farnocchia of the US Space Agency NASA in a communication.
The comet, according to the analysis, is on a so-called hyperbole path that takes it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as reported by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and categorisation of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar swivel stars, which were first led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, were named 2I/Borisov, and the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: in contrast to 1I/'Oumuamuaa 2I/Borisov was already seen in the flight. Thus, researchers will spend many months investigating. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium telescopes by April 2020," said Farnocchia. "Then it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes until October 2020".
Several observatories have already taken the visitor into sight. Thus a team of Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Ouumamua, identified the diameter of the sky object as 2 to 16 kilometres in a first study. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear wave of comet.
Researchers and researchers at the Astrophysic Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar weaving star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets of our solar system, and it indicates that its composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation is very close to the fact that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added the Leons College Javier Licandro.
The discovery of the same two interstellar visitors within only two years after assessing the IAU indicates that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often as such spot visits are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly capture a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
Up to 2028, the agency wants to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" on a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres away from the earth. It is intended, according to Esa-Science Director Günther Hasinger, to run a fresh comet from our own solar system, or an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Ouumua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega Airport Daxing
At the moment before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic it is so: On the new Mega Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first Chinese United Airlines passenger machine is landed, a special honor for Captain and Crew.
By 2022, about 45 million passengers will be finished each year at the new airport, then 72 million in 2025. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's latest prestigious project is also called "sisters" because of its six-story building structure.
The complex has four starting and landing routes to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-way transports passengers in just 20 minutes to the city of Beijing.
Even during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly let Berlin learn from Beijing. The opening of the building since 2006 - and much smaller - capital city airport in Germany has so far been moved again. In Beijing, after four years, a first passenger engine had been established.
New overcrowding aircraft is due to fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British Space Agency dreamt of it. It is possible to make this, which is a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) for the 2030s, which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, quoted the agency as saying: "This is the technology that could definitely be implemented," said Graham Turnock to the broadcaster. "We are talking about the 2030s for the deployment, and the work has already been very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis now takes about 20 hours. As the only passenger-carrying overboard aircraft so far, the Concorde had covered the New York Paris route from 1976 to its establishment in 2003 and used three to three and a half hours. In 2000, there was an accident at the start of a Concorde at the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 Insasses came to life. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans, together with the US Space Agency NASA, to develop a super-aircraft, which has such "X-Plane".
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," says Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. Sabre could be used for efficient travels at a speed of Mach 5 - this means five times as fast as the signal. Furthermore, such aircraft are also usable outside the Earth atmosphere and thus allowed the "next generation truly reusable reusable frame vehicles".
Alarm in Washington: Trump wants to detect anonymous tippers in Ukraine affairs
In Ukraine's case of possible abuse of power by the U.S. president, Donald Trump wants to discover possible unknown places in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday in front of U.S. employees in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and had been treated in the past "a bit differently" than today.
This was valued as a fearsome attempt against tippers. In fact, the event was not public. Several U.S. media distributed audio media from the address on Friday. Democrats responded to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House had announced on Tuesday preparations for an official procedure against Trump. Their proposals were based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous secret service officer who raised heavy charges against Trump and his government headquarters. On a large public pressure, the complainant’s paintings were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government employees, which the US President "uses the power of his office" to ensure that another country is involved in his favor in the 2020 US election.
In the centre of the project, there is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his fellow officials to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about dealing earlier with Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and supposed efforts to protect his language from Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the race for the democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House with a view to Ukraine's telephone also of neglect: leading government staff had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic vocabulary protocol has been produced. This was followed by a discussion on the instructions of lawyers from the White House but was removed from a commonly planned database instead of stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the notifier is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it is intended to be an employee of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets, the president wrote on the subject, among other things, that the so-called Whistleblower had distributed information from a second hand that had been unresolved. Therefore, there may be no tipper or spy.
As Trump expressed himself in New York about those who were supposed to have played with the Whistleblower information, however, he was encouraged. The president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted anxiously and complained, Trump's statement once again undermines the government's integrity.
The House of Representatives has been conducting various investigations against Trump and its environment in various committees for months. In view of Ukraine's proposals, the Democrats are now conducting new investigations with new impetus to put in place a possible anti-Trump collection process.
"The Whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the Chief of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Ship. Trump attacked the ship hard, threw a false presentation of the things before him and demanded again the resignation of the committee president. Trump slandered the ship regularly and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the area of security and foreign policy, most of which were under democratic but also under republican presidents, followed a statement published on Friday after a study initiated by the Democrats for a possible process of collection of office.
There is no precise timetable for the next procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the democracies could try a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on a real office meeting fell in the Senate, where Trump Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. No US President has yet been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Works Council: jobs are being decommissioned "like"
The plans of the VW brand, in which the costs could be further reduced, could go to the burden of production in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the company's operating board. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from 10 billion euros to 2023 by two billion euros. Of them, 500 million euros should be saved this year.
A key to this is staff costs. The "future pact" negotiated between the company and the business council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Essentially, a job can only be demolished when it is almost proved that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment insurance is applicable until 2029.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from business council events, jobs in production that are not actually at the disposal of "like" are being demolished by another way - that is to say, at the official course.
In these cases, the Board of Directors has no opportunity to force the re-establishment. Meanwhile, there are many people who fail to accept the closure of their jobs, the concerns of increasing the number of vehicles before a uniform outflow. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. From VW it was just said, "A change of employment volume is being made as agreed along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardise production even more worldwide and to control new projects centrally. It also aims to reduce costs and also accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus increase competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a Berlin Manager's conference: "Just in uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves a crisis party."
In this way, success already exists: For example, this year, for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle are reduced compared to the previous year. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Gulf 8 to be presented on October 24 in Wolfsburg is about 1.1 hours short.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg family plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The works Braunschweig and Salzgitter make components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern applies the rule that 800,000 cars must be built there annually so that the work can be profitable. In 2018, however, only about 700,000 vehicles were released in Wolfsburg - due to the declining diesel demand and the problems in converting to the new consumption and exhaust test procedure WLTP.
However, as Tostmann’s production board announced last year, in Wolfsburg, a million cars are expected to roll out of the band. This is intended to enable the bonding of golf production in the stockwork - because the Zwickau works by refurbishing to the location for the E-Auto production.
In Wolfsburg, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (seat) are also produced. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, the expectations now rest on the Gulf 8. He should remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburgs in spite of all his efforts to build the e-mobility first.
Enforced with Voodoo to Prostitution: Human Dealer Condemned
Young women from Nigeria are armed with swords, locked in the ruhr area and forced to prostitution. Six needful human dealers have to go to prison for this.
Six conscientious human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday in Bochum to bail and prison sentences of up to eight years and three months. The accused had imprisoned young women from Nigeria and forced them to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, they still had to lay a ritual sword in their home in front of a Voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years of age. They were brought by Libyan castles to seaboats over the Mediterranean. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed on different boards to cover the alleged castle costs of an average of 25 000 euros. Therefore, their salary was fully deducted.
The accused - four men and two women - had added the enclosing and the subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians to Bordelle in the process. "The work made it difficult for the women to make it physically and mentally difficult," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the announcement of judgment. "Some were rightly directed".
The judgments are based on commercial and gang-related inclusion of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, occupations and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm Dauersteit with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened Ufo with strike.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "informed on 14 October about the anti-laboratory measures in the LH group", said Ufo tariff manager Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have been refusing to negotiate tariff negotiations with Ufo for months. It is also a question of whether the trade union has legally announced tariff agreements with Lufthansa.
At this point, Ufo is now strengthened following a decision by the Labour Court of Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the tariff agreements were not announced. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the remedy. "What a second court sees the matter completely differently, I consider it unlikely," said Ufo Board of Directors Fröhr.
In August Lufthansa also filed an application to the Frankfurt State Labour Court for a judicial review of the status of the Ufo as a trade union. The company argued that the trade union had not been appointed by a representative board for months and thus could not fulfil its role as a tariff partner.
Previously, there was a fierce leadership dispute in the division union, in which many members of the board and the council have retreated, including the long-term union chief Nicole Baublies. The Ufo had, due to the doubts about its leadership, suffered an already-initiated urban vote on the strike of the cabin staff at the Eurowings end of July.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new Visa System
So far Saudi Arabia has not been known just as an international tourist magnet. But this should change now. The country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new Visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract international tourists in the future. By 2030, to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission announced.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is still difficult for tourists. Visaverden usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with members of the desert state. The new rules hope for more revenues from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones hit two main oil plants in East Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Chourais oil field. Following this, the national oil production broke dramatically, the oil prices were rising. It could take several weeks until the oil production of the Kingdom reaches its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber stick in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for her wedding party. The model was posted on Thursday (placetime) in their Instagram stories several party photos on which she is to be seen in the white wedding look. Reality Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had, according to the People's Magazine, organized a youth in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colors, including those printed with bananas on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my smoking for the wedding". According to media reports, the promi pair wants to marry church in the coming weekend.
The beebers gave themselves the yes word a year ago in a New York stand room. A larger party had not been there at the time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you do not want to compromise, you cannot lead a relationship".
Two dead in a plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed when a small plane was destroyed in western Czech Republic. The Wrack was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Meschin, the police informed him. The dead are a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the operation via GPS. During the search there was also a military helicopter in use. The accident has yet to be detected. It is approximately 30 kilometres south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometres north-east of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened by extinction
In addition to the victims, diseases, alien species, non-sustainable timber strike and the growth of cities caused by the threat were reported by the IUCN World Conservation Union on Friday in Brussels. It has investigated the stocks of all 454 species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265 are 58 percent threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus die.
IUCN shares endangered species in six categories: from "potentially endangered" via "hazarded", "strongly endangered", "from extinction threatened" and "dead in nature" to "dead". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species and plants as endangered worldwide.
Ebersche and wild Rosskastanie is threatened
In Germany, Eberschen (Sorbus) was threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency said. "Most are threatened because the populations are even small or by the conversion or weakening of their living spaces".
Bad is also the case for the traditional Russians. They have been considered "hazardous since 2017", stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan mini-method. It has spread over the continent since the 1980s from Southeast Europe and has hardly natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Russians (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe on less than 10,000 copies. This assessment does not take into account the trees in cities, parks and islands.
Rain charts and moose also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists have created new European red lists for weights, storks and mooses. More than one-fifth of weights and mooses and almost half of all rain charts are at risk, as the IUCN states. This is especially true of the destruction of the wild, including species, agricultural practices and climate change. weights like snow played a key role in the recycling of nutrients on the ground and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, director of the European Bureau. "We must limit the human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquakes in front of Istanbul: 34 reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. There were no deaths according to the data. dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Thus, hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the earthquake on the previous day, there have been almost 200 survivors. The earthquake of the strength of 5.8 on Thursday had destroyed the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and triggered panic in the millions of metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. Over the past 20 years Turkey has not been prepared enough for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmarameer, there is a section of the so-called North Anatollic Disorder that marks the boundary between the Eurasian and the Anatollic Plate.
One of the worst bees was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, an earthquake of the strength of 4.6 had destroyed the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to keep damaged buildings away.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLO) and Shakira will take place in the semi-time show
The Latin pop singer Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "It won't be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She was crazy to stand on the Super Bowl stage. On 2 February 2020 it will be so in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying at the half-time show in the sky. "Now it is even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I will perform with another Latina". She could hardly expect to "show what we can do on the biggest stage of the world".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored, in addition to another artist standing on one of the largest stage in the world and representing Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it was the first time that the two "kings" were standing together on a stage.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents came from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling numbers of viewers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and half-time show are among the most popular TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you have recently lost viewers: in this February the spectacle in the United States was the smallest viewer for more than ten years. However, it was still nearly 100 million people on the average.
About the half-time show of the past Super Bowl there had been an alarm in the front row: In the fight to deal with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick in the past February media reports according to Topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, Pop Group Maroon 5 launched the half-time show - the critics were not friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of San Francisco 49ers, had gone to the knees in 2016/17 before NFL games at the National Hymne of Protest Against Police Violence and Rassism. With his protest, Kaepernick solved a movement, many players took over the gestures. This made it very exciting, US President Donald Trump attacked most African football stars. Kaepernick himself has been united since March 2017 and no NFL party has fought anymore. He throws the associations away from him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are expected to be expensive in the name of the travel agent Thomas Cook. There are high write-offs on outstanding loans and loans, including the Credit Suisse, the "Financial Times" writes in its issue on Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisse had to make a total of write-downs of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (about 2 billion euros) on their books, as the report said.
The creditors of bonds were required to purchase write-offs of 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. In fact, the amounts to be written should be at the top end of the band, an expert said to the sheet.
As the losses of the creditors will eventually prove, after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A person near this procedure did not offer too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 Thomas Cook aircraft in Great Britain are "old" and many of the properties are in bad positions. Most of the money could be obtained with the sale of the airport slots as well as Thomas Cook brand, it continued.
Rockets should have brought necessary killers to Italy
The Sea Watch Captain Carola Rockette may have brought men to Italy who were to torture and kill people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this, but have not even secured information about it," said the spokesperson of the Refugee Organisation Sea Watch, Ruben Neubauer, the News Agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. You are asked to have raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The necessary perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. New building stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they were leaving on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carolo Rockette had taken illegal migrants into the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, and a ship of the Italian Finance Police had built. On that day, the three suspects were also to arrive there. The Captains are conducting investigations for illegal immigration aid.
USA warns federal government before Huawei
The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too high," Pai said to the "trade sheet" with a view to the development of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which obliges each company "under Chinese law" to comply with the instructions of the security authorities.
The applicable law also prohibits the company from informing third parties about such requests", says the FCC Chief. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "confidential declaration" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "handlesblatt" calling for its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology is not only from hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It is "very difficult to imagine", that a government authority, "no matter where it might be able to check each update in real time to detect security risks", says the FCC Chief.
The Chinese group Huawei offers close contact with the Chinese state apparatus:
The property conditions are impartial. The employee company, which is supposed to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai said to the "trade sheet".
The U.S. presents findings that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to recruit for the U.S. position.
Chemical factory in North France Burns: Schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A giant fire wall lights the sky over a North French chemical factory. The fire is destroyed after hours - the cleaning work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's hips remain closed in the region.
In 12 municipalities, the institutions would not be opening up on Friday carefully, the competent prefecture was informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to put up with the smoke. There was no harm done. Farmers and farmers were called to bring their animals inside to protect their feed and to set up the harvest first.
The fire could be completely removed on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the destruction smell spread, so the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 policemen and gangsters were in use at the Brandort.
A giant black smoke column was previously set up from the chemical factory. French media reported huge fires and explosions in the factory of Lubrizol, which produces oil additives. The production plant is a few kilometres away from the city centre.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Severso category of dangerous sites that are monitored in particular. In the Italian Severso near Milan, there was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the broadcaster BFMTV that there was first no "high toxicity" in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby areas could not be excluded. In the river, dust barriers to pollution were built, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 2:40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located at the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany needs to invest and now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany needs to invest and now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening in the presentation of the French budget for the following year.
The euro area economy is weakening, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation deteriorates in order to make the necessary decisions."
The action would have to be taken by those countries that had the budget spaces for more investment, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these playgrounds, added the Minister and referred to the high state debt of its country. It is located at more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French state debt had to be "stabilized" and "reduced", said Le Maire.
In recent years, more and more calls have come from France to Germany to make more public investments to revive the European economy. In contrast, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to overcome its budget deficit.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
This is how the French government reacts, among other things, to the protests of the Gelbwest movement. The new debt should fall to 2.2 percent, as expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson tends to question Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson criticises the strict "Capitulation Act" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law tells the British prime minister to avoid a chaos brexit, but critics feared that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole, but to this effect, the Tory politicians hesitated.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to implement an irregular Brexit - despite Parliament's last law, which should prevent it.
The law provides that the government must apply for a transfer of the withdrawal deadline, no agreement should be reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law", which makes it difficult to negotiate with the EU.
On Thursday, British Prime Minister John Major expressed his suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political shifts" to enforce the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure that would delay the entry into force of the Act after the EU has left. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Johnson's Chief Counsellor Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, explained that he felt the political contradictions about Brexit as "walking in the park" and expressed confidence that the EU-intended exit would still come: "We will enjoy what we will win, we will (e.g. Red: from the EU), no concern," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led Brexit's Vote Leave campaign in 2016 during the election campaign in Downing Street, now serves as a leading platform in the British government. He is going to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister to a rather unparalleled situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood before Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamorous. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) dives deep into the entire private world of McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda's death from 1969 to 1998, was apparently proud and touched when he presented the film band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrative guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison, and Pretender's Frontwoman Chrisie Hynde.
After the launch of the event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#The PolaroidDiaries is a fledgling view of the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film".
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found her photograph, the camera was always there. Thousands of polaroids made it, several hundred of which are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
It is portraits, quiet life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course there is still one in the center: your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
There he danced with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, telephoned in the bathrobe with a cloth on his head, or wore unformed moonboats. Sure, the McCartneys were an exceptional family, but outside the lighthouse on her farm in South England or Scotland also led a very normal life. Mary McCartney said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that had built her father from old potato boxes. And it has not always been cleaned up at McCartney's.
Like hardly any other medium, the Polarid camera begins the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happened before you. And then you have to cut it in the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it may be a completely different photo." And Linda had the gift always to take the right moment. "You just knew that it had," said Paul in Eshun-Essay.
There, the light, the composition, the picture cut and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining image book for Beatles fans, but also in addition to all the anecdotics is a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly posted Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared just 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from neighbouring countries. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cancel imports of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he participated in the UN Assembly.
Erdogan, however, added that Turkey had problems with imports of Iranian petroleum since some companies had "retired due to the US drains".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran in particular on this and in many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran is pursuing a nuclear programme in secret and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months the tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
U.S. government wants to restrict the admission of refugees
The U.S. government wants to severely restrict the admission of refugees. The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a new residence programme is to be reduced from 30 000 to 18,000 refugees, which represents an average of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained that the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees. However, the most important task was to protect and serve US citizens. At present, the US immigration system is overloaded.
In the future, the US government will focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and thus are in danger, as the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs states. On the other hand, there should be a maximum of 1500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN stockpiles are selected from around the world and re-occupied in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the programme's history. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low value. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House left, the figure was almost 85,000.
Help organizations responded to the announced cut-off of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The United States would thus continue to harm its leadership in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to limit immigration to the United States - legally as illegal - strictly. The US government expects to apply for 350,000 applications for asylum applications for the coming financial year. These figures are separated from the new residence programme.
Donald Trump - "Getting Near a Spitzel"
US President Donald Trump has identified indicators in the Whistleblower affair of the espionage. Anyone who has paid attention to the informant who misappropriates him, "comes close to a peak," Trump said according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. This is consistent with several U.S. media reports.
Then Trump spoke in front of employees of the American UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the Whistleblower about the controversial events in the White House, he replied: "This is a point." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did when we were fighting? Right. The spy and traitor, we were forced to do something different than we were doing now."
Observers took note of the possible use of the death penalty. The democratics had a strong criticism of Trump's statements and offered him a fear of witnesses. It was also an attempt to prevent a congress investigation into a possible recruitment procedure against him, the presidents of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisory at the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower calls on the President in a complaint that his office has been misappropriated in order to ask another country to join the US elections in 2020. It is, among other things, his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian official Wolodymyr Selensky in the summer: In the conversation, Trump approached him to initiate investigations against his possible democratic challenge Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump challenges any misbehaviour.
It is still unclear who the Whistleblower is, as well as its informants. As the New York Times reports, however, the Whistleblower should be an analyst of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Flying boat known: Drinking babies and babies in Ägäis
People are always trying to get over the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. They regularly call the boats too small. At the bottom of a hose boat, seven migrants have come to life, including five children.
Before the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed at the sinking of a boat. Among the victims were a baby and four other children, reports the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men were thus able to be rescued from the floods by occupying a passing ferry.
Among the victims was also to be a locker, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inouses in the north-east of the island of Chios. Inouses is between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey go to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in many small boats. Last year, on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Relief Agency (UNHCR) 174 people died.
The Who Breaks the Concert
A U.S. concert of rock band The Who found a year-long ending due to the incompetence of leader Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the afternoon (placetime) in Houston, his voice refused the service. At eight songs, Daltrey said to the audience, "I think I should let it as long as it is still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for forgiveness and added that Daltrey could "not really talk right now". The audience promised Townsend to come to his expense at a reconstruction concert. But a date is not yet fixed.
For Fridays in Dallas and Sundays scheduled in Denver, The Who said they should be followed at a later time. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly set: WeWork lets real estate markets cittern
In New York, WeWork is the largest office owner.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from the small startup to driving power in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had set aside Adam Neumann as head of the company a few days ago, moved the planned stock exchange, and began selling subsidiaries and values like the private jet for the executives to win financial space for the coming weeks and months. Among other things, the British "Financial Times", WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new leases with immediate effect. Thus, for example, in New York and London, the biggest tenants of offices are suddenly from the market.
WeWork rents large office spaces in the long term and rents them in short term in small units to members. This can be individual free-runs, small startups or entire departments of large groups. WeWork has so far burned up money with this business at amazing speed. Last year the company entered a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with sales of 1.8 billion dollars. In this year alone, the rental costs of new large areas are expected to increase to 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new management should now pull the emergency brakes and the rentals of new areas have stopped with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with periods of up to 15 years, from which commitments of more than 40 billion dollars are made. These huge liabilities could not only become a problem for the company itself and its investors, but for all real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months, almost 300,000 square meters of office space. Only WeWorks New contracts ensured that the demand for offices in New York was larger than the areas that had come on the market at this time. Without WeWorks expansion would have increased the office space in the US metropolis at this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Inside" . Similarly, WeWork looks at where several dozen offices are currently operating in a better position.
Also in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could be shifted without any further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the principal owner, in a house purchased by Deka by the stock exchange supplier last year for almost 100 million euros in the centre of the financial metropolis.
Many tenants have refurbished their properties for WeWork's requirements with high investment. WeWork works to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would have to write off part of the expected billions of revenues. Access to WeWork's - without any button - reserves do not have them in spite of long-term rental contracts. The rental of WeWork's individual locations is usually carried out by individual extra-founded subsidiaries, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company only has close limits.
Russia has again adopted numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In the past days, 262 other wilders were arrested who had illegally fished in the waters, according to the Russian National Intelligence Service FSB of the Agency Interfax, reported on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Before the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injured persons, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian high-level waters. There the Russian Coast Guard carries their own data to protect their marine biological resources Patrols. During the new controls, 30,000 inkfish were discovered. In addition, the data were seized after three fishermen and two motorboats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, the Coast Guard 2018 has identified more than 8,000 violations.
The Russian fishing authority also did not issue fishing licences to North Koreans after complaints by domestic entrepreneurs. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been arrested in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the remote Primorje region, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished closely synthetic nets prohibited with Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply worry in the sea where they would need 200 years to be set up. The ships themselves do not comply with the hygienic and technical rules.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the previous week's arrests. An injured North Korean also died as a result of his injuries, according to the FSB. On 17 September, Russian border guards first set up a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened the fire.
U.S. Convenient entry ban against ex-President Castro
The U.S. has banned the entry bans against former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The American Ministry of Foreign Affairs founded this in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "grave human rights violations". As Head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he introduced a system that would voluntarily arrest thousands of Cubans and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As president of the forces, Fidel Castro, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader, was also guilty of human rights violations there by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro. "The abuse of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump had spoken against members of the Venezuelan government and the military on Wednesday. In Venezuela, for months, he has fought an ambitious power struggle between the government and the opposition. The United States has imposed a whole series of sanctions against the Maduros government to force him into the knees and to help the opposition leader and self-inflicted interim president Juan Guaidó.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduros. The socialist Caribbean is receiving Venezuelan oil in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret agents to Venezuela to assist the government in suppressing government opponents.
New Climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people are looking for more climate protection on the street today.
At the end of an international climate week, the Fridays for Future movement plans new actions and broadcasts in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia should begin because of the time shift before protests take place across Europe to North America. There, climate activists Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major campaign in Canada’s Montreal. Also in front of the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to gather.
How big the worldwide commitment to this Friday after record participation of the week is relatively unclear. Thunberg itself was good things. "Last Friday has reached over four million people for the climate. This Friday we will do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. So far it has given in the context of strike week 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
A good third of all world-wide demonstrators - about 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates of Fridays for Future. This time a list of the movements according to the results was planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jeuken in North Rhine-Westphalia or Western England, people want to go to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set himself in front of the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of his country to make greater use of climate protection. Within a short time, the Fridays-for-future movement was created. In the climate protests, students and students are mainly involved, but to an increasing extent also scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more respect for politics in the fight against global warming and the threatening climate catastrophe. In particular, under the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming has to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived almost a month ago after a two-week transatlantic shift with a high-sea reindeer in New York, where she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday she gave an emotional talk to the UN, in which she spoke strongly to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth. In her home Stockholm she was promised on Wednesday for her use for more climate protection of the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livehood Foundation.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
The people in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This is a change in fire protection. "This is also true of smoking," said a speaker from the Ministry of Emergency Affairs in Moscow on Thursday. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
Whoever smokes, then, has to count with a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette is to be removed a fire, then the penalty falls higher. The Ministry is banned from burning candles as well. Also, it is not allowed to grill meat on the balcony.
Fight against cybercriminals - resolver remove server
In the fight against Internet crime, German investigators have for the first time raised a large server provider for illegal business in the darknet.
A total of 13 actors are suspected of having hosted numerous websites at the Mosel as an operator of a computer centre in a former Nato banker in Traben-Trabach, across the international acting criminals, operating their capabilities.
This was reported by the State Attorney General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night with a large action. The darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Customers of suspects are expected to be the operators of the world's second largest darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market", among other things – the investigators had destroyed in the spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was managed by the General Public Prosecutor on a server in cyber bunker.
One such host was first raised in Germany, it was called. A webhost provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
In the case of the access operation with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and neighbouring abroad. It has been the result of almost five years of investigations. In the afternoon the investigators want to know more details.
New global climate protests of Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people are looking for more climate protection on the streets today.
At the end of an international climate week, Fridays for Future are relaunching action and advertising in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major event in Canadian Montreal.
Climate protests - Who are Thunberg's rearmen?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. So amazing is it that an estimated 16-year-old girl holds the powers of this time the mirror before the nose. But what is behind it? Is it an aid preparation or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical Mastership or manipulative tactics around her own?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg puts the masses in motion and brings young people up for a better climate-friendly world. It is not historically seen for the first time in Europe that a young man makes it a gathering of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has chosen to use himself for a fairer world. At that time, he has also been able to win a scarf of young people for himself and overcome it to cross the sea in order to reach the Promised Land, like Greta Thunberg recently made his trip to America with a sailing boat.
But is there a shadow page about this? Why does it need a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? Furthermore, Greta Thunberg has rich PR manager on her side. In addition, her mother published a book, which was widely sold thanks to the daughter standing in the light of the disaster. Also, well-proved followers of Greta Thunberg were a little upset about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably also set up by some followers. This is also not unfounded, because the action came very well in the media worldwide and it flows a lot of money thanks to the imposing action.
Here the Spirits now separate: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain circles of people work together with stock exchangemakers during the world's rescue action? No matter what position the latter is, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy lives by different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to ask questions of specific trends set.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses our solar system
A strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The suspicions of astronomers have confirmed: A foreign comet crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Long the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Crimea. He looked at his first suspicion with a self-built telescope, and other observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind that was seen during the journey.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to capture insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles our own system, as reported by the Astrophysics Institute of the Canarys. The comet is according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) of clear interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbele track that takes it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before arrival - and can be seen for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in depth. Because unlike his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be investigated from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes by April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Agency NASA. "Then it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes until October 2020".
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Ouumamua".
First knowledge about comet 2I/Borisov raises hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial bodies seem to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the swimming star is similar to ours. This observation is close to that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, complemented by Leon's colleague Javier Licandro.
The observation, however, goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have been discovered within only two years allows, under circumstances, a new path to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are always busy again. Only recently a giant asteroid spread over the earth and approached it dangerously.
"Absolutely Acquired": Rachel Johnson excited about brother
Boris Johnson will be lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister will say in clear words the war language of the Prime Minister as "untasteful". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", Contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is still under pressure and is still equipped with - at least verbal. At the hour of question in the basement this Wednesday, it was a massive boost to the opposition, and in the meantime other critics have reported themselves: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the Messenger Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU-outset should be "hanged, dragged, trimmed, tortured and fed" . She kept this to the utmost merit . She did not recognize her brother's version again , said Rachel Johnsons, who had attended the elections to the EU Parliament for the Anti-Brexit Party "Change UK".
In particular, she was concerned that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly under-house agent who had been murdered a few days before the Easter referendum in 2016 by a Neo-Nazi. Their thoughts could best be honored by passing through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the under-house. "It is very tasteless to refer to an officer who was murdered by someone who called the 'British first'," said Johnson's sister. The actor was obviously coming from the right-wing camp that felt "through this kind of language". For all those who were concerned, it was very tasteless.
Cox's widower also criticised the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jos Name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is if you are passionately and determined to enter into this, wherever you believe - no matter what your views are. But you can never "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere was created, in the attacks became more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had laid down his office as State Secretary and his mandate as Tory Deputy. "I was breaking up in the past months between loyalty to the family and national interest - it is an unresolved tension," explained Jo Johnson.
Johnson's language also stood in the church on sharp criticism. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language that "this country is not worthy of it". In a common statement they declared: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez arrive at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100-year-old existence, the NFL has a strong sign: In the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming U.S. Football League NFL finals.
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community in addition to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, takes place in Miami on 2 February. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is a Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-olds were born in New York after their parents were expelled from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in the drama "Houstlers" in the German cinemas since November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. Her worldwide breakthrough was created in 2001 with her first two-language album and the single "Whereever, Whereever".
The announcement of half-time guests is expected in the United States each time with excitement. In this year many people also value the election as political gestures. Finally, the country, not least through the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a giant commercial. musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and Rolling Stones provided for Furore. Usually they look at over 100 million TV viewers at the NFL finale, it is also very popular in Germany.
Last year there was political controversy. The reason for the dispute was the Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise up in protest against police violence against black people while playing the national anthem, and for that reason, among other things, the US President Donald Trump had been harsh. From solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super-bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. Finally, the rock group Maroon 5 was criticised.
One actor and youtuber adds to Egypt's ruler: First, Mohamed Ali remains rather abroad.
The two men, who have the influence of whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt, have spent the past week both of them abroad. One of them swooped back on Friday at Cairo Airport. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. In a week, the former General, who left Egypt's first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's campaign against political Islam and lost no silver on human rights violations at the Nile - in one week, in which the Egyptian security forces arrested hundreds of people, because she had waited for it, against the president of Egypt.
Irres leads - in the view of the president of the other man, who is currently determining the events on the streets. Mohamed Ali remained, of course, abroad, where he withdrew from the access of the security forces who would arrest him immediately when he tried to enter Egypt. Last week, the 45-year-old actor was only known to a minority of Egypt. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafés, living rooms and tastes of the country: With his YouTube channel "Mohamed's Secrets" Ali calls his countrymen to rise against Sisi.
He goes to the head of state directly and in a very rustic language. While the people are hungryer, the president faints in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it is there. The army leader, on whom Sisi is based his reign, is causing Ali corruption and division. Because he had been working exactly with these masters for 15 years in his second career as a builder, he seems to know exactly what he is talking about - at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the just-explosive clicks show.
After the first week of Sisy's campaign against his rule, and almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "million march" on Friday. That, in fact, so many people would ride on the streets, was unlikely. But there came to be simple smaller protests, such as in Giseh at Cairo and in the town of Luxor. Videos showed protests, whose participants in the social media suspected corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also put in trengengas and rubber boots. These videos did not initially prove themselves independent of the police.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonstrators last week banded banners with the President's portrait in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces created checkpoints in the city and on the highways. In Cairo several subway stations in the city were closed because of "containment work", most roads around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the Revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Raba Square, where supporters of the hardened Muslim brother Mursi were on the scene in 2013, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent unsatisfied people from gathering: Sisis the future party wanted to calculate a large holding of the president.
Mohamed Ali imposed these provisions on a change in his tactics: "Our goal should not be the Tahrirplace," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not interfere with police officers." But as a returner, it is not to be understood: "A lot of Egypt is the Tahrirplace".
If the supplier promises too much performance
If the Internet connection seems to be much slower than purchased by the provider, there are various test options.
If an internet contract is concluded, it does not need to be blind to the speed information provided by the provider. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the promised transfer rates are a component of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, the consumer central Bayern explains.
If the connection seems to be much slower than the supplier, there are various test options. Thus the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the contractual rate.
"The tests of the suppliers, however, are carried out according to specific requirements and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," says the consumer central Bayern on their side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days for the provider to produce the promised performance.
If this does nothing after multiple calls, customers can cancel and, under circumstances, claim damages. However, in the case of outstanding success, only the way of complaint is still helpful.
First-class Republicans for Investigation
The governor of Vermont spoke for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it comes from, is determined by the facts that will be established," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republicans have so far remained critical of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have found dissatisfaction. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policy, for example against the lockdown of environmental regulations and the strengthening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man Stays in MCU: Next Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it was known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would thus not be part of the "Avenger" University. It was completely unclear how it should go with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives a third final film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This report is consistent with several U.S. media. The film is expected to start in the USA as of July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenant" Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: "I am pleased that Spidery's path will continue in the MCU. I and all of the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidery version. You never know what the future will bring".
But how does it come to the sudden good news? Apparently Sony Marvel would have submitted an offer. According to industry stores, the Disney Group, which also includes Marvel, would participate by 30 percent in the revenues of coming Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
This is how Duke Meghan and Prince Harry dive into the "Suits" final.
After nine seasoning, the series "Suits" in the United States is now at the great finale. In the latter, there were many happy endings and also many Cameo performances. And also to the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who had been involved in the series for many years, had a charming tribute. Attention, the following sections include spoolers to the series finale.
One way forward: Herzogin Meghan did not return in the final for a final divorce as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some of the most interesting scenes with today's Herzogin showed him again. So, for example, the moments of the broken and happy wedding with Mike or how she welcomes him after his sentence of imprisonment.
But her true husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) straight to the altar to marry his beloved Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a number of comments about this suit. Whether he has actually passed a horror, the accused Harvey wants to know from the bridesmaid only to note in a sloppy way: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England."
Eggs: Baby and four other children drink at boatsungluck
At the center of a refugee boat in the Aegean, a baby and four other children were drunk. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard reported on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inouses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey now move to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Relief Agency (UNHCR) 174 people died. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that they want to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wants to "intellect on how it is about the refugee situation in Turkey," said Seehofer on Friday. He then wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help deal with them.
On Friday, a spokesperson for the EU Commission confirmed the planned voyage of Lakehofers with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, there are still unusual numbers of migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people moved to the Greek islands, called it from the Greek Civil Protection Ministry on Wednesday.
Does the Turkish deal still work?
The increased numbers recently raised doubts as to the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016, which provides that the EU can return all refugees and migrants who illegally come across Turkey to the Greek islands. On the contrary, the EU wanted to take up an Syrian refugee from Turkey for each of the displaced Syrians.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only difficult because of the lack of staff on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, there are almost 29 400 people in Lesbos: In a warehouse with capacity for 650 people, 5,200 migrants are currently in detention.
Since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, so many have been reported by the state radio.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "very safe" one of the greatest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the heart-circuit system made high temperatures and high temperatures within a short period of time and led to heart disease. In particular, people with heart-circuit disorders, older people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician has to be responsible for a painful photo panel
The chief of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election struggle - was manipulated for this reason by the beaker?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in his hand on a photo. But now came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has been undetected for quite a long time - and finally it has fallen. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw has never been held by Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website she was to see a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo was already published and also distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a faster (Papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green boss has to be responsible for the photo panel
The National Post then proposed Manipulation and that the Fake News party produce more crediblely on the topic of "Environmental Protection" and that in the middle of an election for the sub-house election, in which Trudeau is also increasingly difficult because of a scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and began the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a counter-translation of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their en route cup".
May showed himself shocked and admired on her blog not knowing anything about this action. To emphasize this, she just posted the original: She, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she put it right out of Bamboo. She always did. A speaker of the party said it was just going to put the party logo in the picture, and not to miss something. From the photo there is only one cut on the website.
May writes, it does her grief for the employee who has done this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says about the Guardian, and at the same time something happened to her over-reached team: "If they like to edit a picture again, then they couldn't do anything to my face, so I look younger?"
Even the German greens have arrived because of their use of single-way plastics or because of the flights in Shitstorms - but their images were not photoshoped. So the head of the Bavarian greens, Katharina Schulze, on holiday ice with plastic flakes, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer wants Free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Apparently, Jaqueline Ng was guaranteed an upgrade by Cathay Pacific by mail. But when she asked for it at the check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never fly with Cathay again.
Spontan get an upgrade for the business class - many of them dream of flying. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the economy class for free.
However, this case shows how it should not be done: A self-declared influencer has actively requested the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Follow the Instagram Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she fled from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the slope, Jaqueline staff refused an upgrade, although they had shown a mail in which their Cathay Pacific reportedly presented an upgrade. The letter wanted to have the influence of an airline marketing employee. On the other hand, the airline accused Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
On the return trip, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at JFK Airport were skeptical: they hated at the center. In fact, the employee who allegedly came from the mail had broken the mail contact with Jaqueline. It also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airlines canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 US dollars (about 1.280 Euro) she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests. Although Catay had paid the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the mail metadata, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. The operating conditions of the airline also confirm that this does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to meet - and now activates a lawyer.
Oil prices are reported in Yemen on ceasefire.
The oil prices fell by more than a dollar on Friday afternoon. Lastly, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea class Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate Sort (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the course was a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is supposed to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had caused five percent of the world's oil production to be questioned in mid-September. The Huthi rebels in the country of civil war in Yemen had advertised the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia makes Iran responsible for the way the U.S. government does. A ceasefire would exacerbate the political tension in the region.
If an agreement actually exists, one can concentrate on growth and demand, Ole Hansen, head of the Department of Raw Material Strategy at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency, said.
The oil price continues its downward movement over the past few days. One week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had still cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Finally, Bloomberg, calling on Insider, reported that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia was faster than expected after the attack in mid-September. Thus, the production volume again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved again towards the original amount.
Lastly, there were several press releases calling on insiders, which reported rapid progress by the state oil company Saudi Aramco in repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to avoid a stock exchange and negative hit lines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The occupation now prepares the departure, while the ship is still in front of the anchor, Riderreichef Erik Hånell told the Swedish radio on Friday morning in an SMS.
However, the U.S. announced that the Iranian enemy would be sent to Saudi Arabia by rockets and soldiers. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and the United Kingdom had driven oil prices in recent weeks to a significant extent.
Pretends against Trump are sharpening
In the area of the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, protests against the White House have been voiced. Several leading government officials have been working hard to prevent access to the speech of the conversation after a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky in late July. This explained an anonymous notifier. The speaker of the House of Representatives, the Democratic Nancy Pelosi, specifically proposed "debt". Trump spoke of a "Hexenjagd".
North Korea holds the third summit of Trump and Kim for Question
North Korea has expressed doubts that in the nuclear battle it will soon come to a third summit of power holders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of such a meeting are due to lack of progress in implementing the first summit agreements in Singapore, said senior diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA Agency.
The United States had not done anything to implement the summit's decisions in the previous year, said the consultant of the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He also criticised increased US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea. But he hoped for a "wise" and "might" decision of Trump to bring it closer again.
Trump had said on Monday he only wanted to know what a third summit meeting with Kim should bring before he would make it clear. Negotiations on the decommissioning of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have taken place since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to resume the consultations, but so far without great success.

Pound under pressure - interest expected
British Pound Under Pressure
In the light of a rapid increase, the fund loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on an early interest rate of the Bank of England (BoE) adds to the Pound Sterling. On Friday, the British currency amounted to up to 0.4% to $1,2269.
The sellers of the sales were expressions of the Notenbanker Michael Saunders. This led to an increase in the conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit could be rejected, as the insurance would affect the British economy at an unexpected time. This statement was surprising because Saunders was considered to be the advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed to the economic pressures caused by the Brexit Hickhack without directly signaling a rise in interest. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to lead his country from the EU without a divorce agreement to 31 October.
More: The British Prime Minister took a high risk with his provocations, but it could pay for him, says commercial editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Show more Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow Analytical Laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, the sole director of the World Anti-Tidoping Agency (Wada) and today's Head of Integrity of the World Association for Light Athletics.
New details on the Doping scandal in Russia are expected to emerge - and they destroy the little credibility that the Russian sport had recovered at the beginning of the year and only subsequently. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Tidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were faked.
In December 2014, the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) was banned for three years. During that time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee read after an individual examination in the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, about 270 athletes from the country under neutral flags, while in the winter games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes and athletes were on the move. Also at the World Cups in the different sports were supposed to be in the summer, even the football World Cup took place in Russia with the host.
No positive results
In the following September, the Wada raised the Rusada band again, but called for access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide a solution about the extent of doping cases at the state doping. They should help to punish athletes and athletes afterwards. Three months later they were delivered to the final.
However, the president of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Light Athletics World Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the Doping data from the Moscow Analyse laboratory was manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the correct data," David Howman said in the interview of the "Frankfurter General newspaper" on Friday. "We have identified a number of differences between the data that the Wada has received from a whistleblower and those that they have received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing that were mentioned in the McLaren report.
Not affected by the WM
This confirms the position of the IAAF: The Light Athletics Association holds as the only organization on the Russian Band. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flags. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put the manipulations into space and called on Russia to respond to the proposals within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the resurgence of the Rusada and, in the worst case, also the exclusion of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
