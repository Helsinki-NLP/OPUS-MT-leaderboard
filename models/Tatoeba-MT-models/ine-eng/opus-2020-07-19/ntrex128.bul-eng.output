The members of the Wells Assembly are concerned that they “seem to be like moths ”
Part of the members of the Assembly are stoned by their proposal to change their name to "CPU" (member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was prompted by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the "Parliament of Wells".
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could be a cause for laughter.
One of the liberators said that his group was concerned because the new name is "Rome with Tup and Wdlub."
For readers outside Wells: In Wellsky, this is definitely harmful.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the whole group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
The representative of the Welsh Conservative Party indicated that his group "has not been persuaded" to change the name, but notes that the new name CWP (MWP) has a certain verbal opportunity with "mupet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is similar to the English Yorkian reference to the letter U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the draft legislation to change its name, made the following statement: "It is understood that the final decision for all descriptive names by which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves".
The Wells Government Act of 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry into the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to start calling itself the Parliament of Wales.
As far as the duties of its members are concerned, the Commission prefers "member of the Parliament of Wells, briefly "CPU", but the "CPU" option has received the greatest support after a public inquiry.
Members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elin Jones, from which it is expected to submit the draft bill's black for change to a few weeks.
The reforming bill will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, i.e. rules for the disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the Commission system itself.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they reach the draft law.
Macedonians will vote on a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has an administrative area called "Macedonia".
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to the Greek state territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on changing the name of the country, has said that you will not vote.
Nevertheless, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in the name of the country is simply the price that must be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells close in the background of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"If we look at a historical plan, according to the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church literally at every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today both have disappeared."
Adams shares that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"The horrors today are socializing in different ways," he adds.
"The barrels are no longer the quartiles every day, where everyone gathers regularly."
As to the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of assets will not reach as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be in the same situation".
The man adds that the churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments where people live who don't help survive the rest of the neighborhood sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy houses in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them."
Both churches were built by white roads before Harlem became a neighborhood of the Blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's decade later.
The initial White Methodist Passage took place in the years after 1930.
After that, the building became owned by black people in the neighborhood.
"St. Martin" was a poet by the black Christians under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who organized the fight against the traders on the 125th street, which is the main market street in Harlem, as they did not want to hire black officials.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire damage, but Father Johnson's Norwegians made a plan for her restoration, where the bells were ordered.
The famous David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, and the heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them the "poor bells".
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first system of bells in the world, which was used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meryueder mentioned that St. Martin had not been replaced.
What has been played in St. Martin over the past few weeks has been a complicated story, drawn from architects and performers, some brought by the world’s leaders of the church, and others from the Episcopal Church.
From the Vestary – which is the leader of the Passion, consisting of world leaders – they wrote to the Eparchy in July expressing their concern that the Eparchy would "be inclined to transfer the costs of the Vestary", although it did not have a role in hiring the architects and performers sent by the Eparchy.
Some Americans have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the parish.
13-year-old child injured by sharks in lobster hunting in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday, while it was crawling for lobsters in California on the first day of the fishing season, representative authorities reported.
The attack happened just seven mornings ago near the Bicon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel shared in front of KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was hanging out with friends about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and he walked in with the whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought that the child was tired and excited, and then he realized how he cried out, “Awake me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said when he got to the boy, he realized that the entire area of his key was broken.
"I called everyone out of the water because there's a shark!" he adds.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to a critical condition.
It's still not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Gills said a media briefing that a few weeks earlier in the water had been noticed, but it was estimated that it was not of a dangerous nature.
Gilles adds that the victim has suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of his body.
The responsible authorities closed access to the beach line Ponto in Kazablad to Suomi in Ensitinas for 48 hours from safety concerns while the investigation was ongoing.
Gilles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury plans offensive to the British wholesale market for decorative products
Sainsbury faces Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, opening stands for decorative products in its facilities, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK retail market, which is estimated to be 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and domestic products decrease, the biggest retail retailers will be placed in 11 stores from all over the country, after which, in the success of the initiative, such will be discovered in more objects.
The investment in the beauty industry is being made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the shelters, recently occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household appliances.
From Sainsbury, they said they would double the number of the products offered up to 3000 products, and for the first time they included brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, like the offers in Boots stores.
The supermarket also relaunchs its boutique range of mushrooms, so most products can be used from vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger users.
In addition, perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will try discount programs in two Sainsbury shops, the first of which opened in Croedon, South London last week, while the second will be opened in Selie Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online marketing and the shifting focus on the marketing of smaller quantities of food daily at comfortable times leads to the need for supermarkets to put more effort into attracting buyers.
Mike Coup, CEO of Sainsbury, shared that the facilities would look more and more like universal stores, while the chain of supermarkets is trying to deal with Aldi and Lidl discounts, offering more services and non-food.
From Sainsbury they have Argos' objects in hundreds of stores, as well as Habitats' objects, since they bought both chains two years ago – which they claim from the company has increased the sales of food and made the acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous experience of the supermarket chain to refascinate its objects for decorative and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury had a joint experience with Boots in the beginning of the new century, but the association ended up after a dispute to distribute the profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 Celesio's object, which is owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing the rich range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, trade director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have transformed the nature and nature of our beautiful stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We also invested in special training for our colleagues who would offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands proposed by us is designed to respond to every taste and all necessary in a pleasant setting, making us an attractive destination for decorative products that creates a challenge to the very concept of the old way of marketing."
Peter Jones "bessen" after Holly Willubi's cancellation of a 11 million pounds deal
The Dragons Dan Peter Jones star "has got mad", after TV leader Holly Willubi has turned down the 11 million pounds deal with his lifestyle company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Wilby doesn't have time for the brand home appliances and accessories True.
The couple's business is compared to the Goop brand of Guinet Poltrou.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced his departure to Instagram.
Holly Willubi left the Dragons Den Peter Jones star "to pee", after getting rid of their business with the brand of lifestyle products in the last minute – focusing on its own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones "has become angry" when the "golden girl" on TV acknowledged during the tense meeting on Tuesday in the centre of his business empire in Marlow, Buckingamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to 1.5 million pounds, mean that there will be no longer time for his brand home products and accessories True.
The business is about the Goop brand of Guinet Poltrou, as the rumors are that he doubled Willubi's fortune, whose value is projected to be 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willubi announced in Instagram his abandonment of True, Jones left Britain by plane to go to one of his holiday properties.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to ensure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave the matter completely unprepared.
No one believed that this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse in Marlowe that's full of waiters waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leading 'This morning', which is one of the most successful stars in the UK, could cost the company millions because of the large investment in products ranging from capacitors and candles to clothing and household products, as well as could lead to a slowdown in the launch of the market.
And not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Wilby, who has been a mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, is a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willubi himself founded True with Cap in 2016, as Jones, who was 52, joined the company as president in March.
Both families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willubi will become an "messenger" of the M&S brand and will also replace Ann McParlin as the leader of the broadcast "I am famous" on ITV.
A source that is close to Jones last night made the following statement: "We will not comment on his business".
Heavy negotiations leading to the 'relationship'
He jokes about the criticisms that he would bring from the press channels for making a comment, which someone would consider as "inappropriate to the President" and too positive for North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump's answers in his hot "innovatory" way.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting, after the first in Singapore in June and was announced by Trump as "a major step towards removing the nuclear weapon of North Korea".
But the negotiations on the elimination of this weapon are in place.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea diplomat Ri Young Ho told the representatives of the UN General Assembly that North Korea "does not see reciprocity" by the US towards the country's first steps on the way of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the US continues with the sanctions that aim to maintain the tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were headed for war with this country.
Millions of people would be killed.
Instead, we now enjoy a wonderful relationship."
The president said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results – stopping tests with missiles, releasing hostages and returning home to the bodies of American soldiers.
He also defended his non-orthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to behave as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to enter this crowded area, we'd have about 200 people right there," Trump said, facing the crowd in front of him.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia desert the island and lead to the death of hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were declared unnecessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombard population were forced to leave their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for initiating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, there is an unmistakable opinion that there is no need for international aid, which makes things slightly challenging," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While "Save the Children" is a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
The national disaster agency spokesman, Mr. Sutopo, announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palo to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Considering the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains so unprepared for this type of natural disaster.
Although in Aceh there were shelters in the case of tsunamis, they are not often seen on the other shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was given.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the majority of Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more complicated.
Recently stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, a hospital ship has moved to Palu, but will pass at least three days before it can reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Weidodo has turned Indonesia's remaining infrastructure into the center of his election campaign, investing a large amount of resources in roads and railway lines.
But the lack of finance is constantly blocking his office, while Joco's getting the urn again next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with swords, bows, and arrows, as well as other original weapons.
See: Daniel Street brought late equality for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing in the High League against Chelsea in the 89th minute this Saturday of the Stanford Bridge in London.
Stridge got a delivery from Jardan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door while his team was left with 1-0.
He set the ball on his left foot, then sent a precise shot to the remote corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penal field and directed to the top right corner of the network.
She transferred the plagiarism of Kepa Arisabalaga and crashed into the network indiscriminately.
"I tried to take a good position to control the ball because players like Shak are always looking for submissions in front positions, so I just tried to make the most of the time possible for a good shot at the door," Stridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I've seen the Kante giving up, I've pushed my ball, and I've just shot without much-thinking."
Chelsea took 1-0 in the 25th minute after the goal of his Belgian star One Azar.
The attacker of the "saints" submitted a fifth to Mateo Kovacic, then printed from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
Cowboy exchanged fast double delivery in the center.
After that, he released a fast shot dog that led Azar to a clean position in the criminal field.
Azar ran the defenders and noticed with his left foot in the far corner next to the gate of Liverpool Alison Baker.
Liverpool will face Napoleon in the group stage of the Champion League at 15:00 this Wednesday at St. Paul Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the League of Europe of WEFA at 3:00 a.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of the buildings, met after the earthquake with a magnitude 7.5, which struck the country on Friday and led to waves of up to 20 feet, reports the press conference's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 people, is surrounded by ruins of the ruins.
Police arrest a man 32 years of suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was initiated after Mercisside discovered a woman's body this morning at Berkenhead.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 in the morning with wounds from the arrest of Grayson Mouse of John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of committing murder.
The police are asking for assistance from all the areas they've seen or heard.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made the following statement: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I beg all who were close to John Street in Berkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also ask all, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with the cameras on their table, to contact us, as it is possible to have vital information for the investigation."
Police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body is open is Berkenhead's resident and that she was found in private property.
This afternoon a group of friends who consider the woman their acquaintance came to the spot and asked where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues when the police report that he is informing the victim's relatives at the moment.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mouse tried to get back to his apartment, but he was informed by the police that no one was allowed to come in or out of the building.
The man remained silent when he realized what had happened.
The residents were told that they would be allowed to return for hours.
One of the police officers reported to a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A grieving woman appeared on the scene.
She continues to repeat "this is so terrible".
Two afternoons two police baths passed through the border while another van stayed outside.
There are police officers in the border watching the housing block.
All available information is requested to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, code 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue becomes the newest memory hit by "rewriting history"
Its ban will be poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts that are carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But "The Cromwell Society" described Mr. Creek's proposal as "bezzamy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in this debate to remove Oliver Cromwell's statues to the Palace of Westminster.
The icononomy of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Croweel.
Perhaps the wrong Crowell will be turned into a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
The magnificent performance of Crowell by Sir William Hamo Tornichoff is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the story of a figure that many still consider to be worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromuel is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which has shaped our nation's next development, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person who represents one side of the division.
His achievements as a Lord Protector also deserve recognition and honor."
Prose-killer wounded a deadly Chinese farmer
Farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his family as Juan, was found dead with the late artery and covered in blood near the market of Liupanshui in Wayjou Province, reported Sunday at South China Morning Post.
The pigs prepared to inject their pigs with vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Sinin from the province of Zinhai, China.
He was supposed to be here with his cousin from the neighboring province of Greece on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also knocked on the door to the neighbor’s door open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig in the hut with a blood-cured walnut.
The forensic expert confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked a deadly farmer, reports the report.
"My cousin's step was bleeding and disfigured," said cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The recording from the security camera shows how Juan goes to the market at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pig.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The killer was not a member of John or his cousin.
The market manager announced to Evening News that the pig was locked up so that he could not attack anyone else while the police collect evidence from the crime scene.
It has also been reported that the family of Yuan and the management of the market is negotiating a death benefit.
Although they're rare, it's been reported before about the pigs that attack people.
In 2016 the pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man was severely injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig drove a Welsh farmer to his tractor while his wife managed to chase him.
After an oregano farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba announced to CBC News that the pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can affect them as a "push".
"They're just playing.
The pigs are like small children, extremely curious... they have no purpose in hurting anyone.
But a man should also treat them with respect," the man concludes.
The weakening hurricane Rosa will lead to honour and flood rains in the southwestern United States
According to weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, during the next days, Rosa will lead to floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States.
Rosa includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is an hurricane of category 1, considered to be 5 hours a week in the morning east time and is located 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
She's expected to move north this week.
During this time, over the Pacific, I begin to form a cyclical that moves east to the western coast of the United States. While Rosa is approaching the peninsula of Baha California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push the tropical invasion deep in the north to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Within the next few days, the tropical investment along with the approaching cycle will create frequent heavy rains in the south-west.
At local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid floods, torrents and possible precipitation in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to a range of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the south-west, rain is expected from 2 to 4 inches, especially above most of Arizona.
It is possible to have flashing floods in rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unreasonable to travel a trap in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to high dust and stormy winds.
The approaching galaxy will lead to heavy rains in some parts on the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach valleys of over half an inch, which will lead to brought small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy season.
In the late week and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area on late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October can bring great temperature fluctuations in the United States, while the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There's about 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moin, Iowa.
In the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will try to increase and expand.
Most of the Central and Eastern US are expected to have a warm beginning in October, from the southern levels to parts of the north-east are expected to overcome temperatures of about 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern part of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kawanau's hearing.
More than 20 million people saw on Thursday six television networks the attractive adult of the certificate of nominations for the Supreme Court of Brett Kawanau and Christine Blasi Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which occurred in the 80s of the 20th century.
During that time, political opposition continued, with the networks interrupting their regular return programmes in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement, which was arranged by Iranian Senator Jeff Flake and according to which the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that she was 100% convinced that Kawanau had pressed her drunk and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kawanau, in her absence of emotional evidence, is absolutely categorical that something like this has not happened.
It's probably even more than Nielsen's reported number of 20.4 million viewers watched the testimony on Friday.
The company has counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no direct data available for other networks that broadcasted the hearing, i.e. PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also traditionally experiencing difficulties in measuring the number of people who look at their jobs.
For comparison, we're talking about a audience similar to that of a champion football match or Hollywood prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kawanau's appointment, is the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, Nielsen reports.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen CBS reported that it had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million, and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high and after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate republican came out with a statement that he would vote in support of Kawanau, CNN and CBS cameras filmed on Friday as protestors were trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During the entire brake for a few minutes, he did not raise his eyes from the ground, which was emitted live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he presents the truth to the state?
"You have power while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Fleke refused that his office had already issued a declaration and, prior to closing the elevator doors, announced that it would take place further during the hearing by the Commission.
Cable and broadcasting networks provided a smooth coverage of live several hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer the nomination of Kawanau to the attention of the entire Senate for the vote.
Ala Flake reported that he would do this only if he was sure that the FBI would review the charges against the nominations next week, for which the Democrats insist in the opposition.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the senator of the Chris Kuons Democratic Party.
After talking to Kuons and a few senators, Flek made a decision.
His election was definitely essential, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes for the approval of Kawanau without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges against Kawanau.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for "political games" with Brexit
Minister Teresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political games" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published with her on the first page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "Lamme Game Plan" for Brexit, suggesting that the collection of customs taxes from the UK for the EU and vice versa is "very absurd".
Wade Simms Shooting: Police Arresting Suspects Dietian Simpson for LSU Player's Death
Police arrest suspect for the final fatal shot at Wade Sims, the 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Ditian Simpson, in his 20s, was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder charges reported by the Baton Rouge police department.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, as police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses on the spot and they also found Simpson's DNA on them, reported by the branch of CBS WAFB.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police informed him that he recognized the fatal shot against Wade.
His guarantee is set at $350,000, reported by the Attorney.
The Medical Service of Eastern Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, which, as a cause of death, mentions a gunshot wound, touched the head and door.
From the government they express their gratitude to the office for investigating refugees from the Louisiana State Police, the police crime lab, the South University Police and local residents for the assistance they have provided in the investigation, which has contributed to the arrest.
The Director of Athletic Sports of LSU Joe Aleva thanks local law enforcement authorities for "temporary justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall 6 feet and 6 inches player grew up in Baton Rose, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
Average last season reached 5.6 points and 2.6 rickets of the game.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach announced that the team was "fucked" and "shocked" after Wade's death.
Wade said that "this is something that worries a person all the time."
Volcano sprayed ash over Mexico City
The drop from the Volcano Popocatepetal ash reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater has increased and 183 gas and ash emissions have been recorded in the last 24 hours.
The center was watching a lot of rabbits and tremors.
Published in the social media shows a thin layer of dust that covers the front windows of cars in some of Mexico City’s neighborhoods, for example in Hokimilko.
The geophysics have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, still known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the year of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after the independence protesters met with the gendarmerie when thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to mark the first year of the polarising Catalunium removal vote.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to mutilate the peacekeepers with eggs and dust paint, creating dark and dust clouds on the streets that are usually clouded by tourists.
Later in the day, other insights came along with the police, when the police ran to their thumbs to control the situation.
For hours, groups supporting independence shouted, "We don't forget, we don't forgive," while the country's integrity was declared to be preserved with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The tension remained high in the desired independence of the region even a year after the referendum on 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catholics.
The vast majority voted to vote for independence, although the activity was low, as most of the disengagement opponents boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region with a number of violent clashes.
Wanted independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was in progress, but it was forced to go on a different route.
Narciss Termes, an electrician, joined his wife's separatist protest, says he no longer has the hope of Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now it seems we're in a state of arrest," the man added.
Despite the marked important victory, it was, in a minor way, the regional elections in last December, supporting the independence of the Catalan political parties are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most well-known leaders are either in a self-declaration or are arrested in anticipation of the process because of their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Pyug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest on his phone in support of the police, claims that the conflict was provoked by both politicians.
His comment is that "it is becoming increasingly tense".
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catholic leaders arrested in anticipation of a preliminary process last year, announced that he would be nominated in the European Parliament elections next year.
He claims that "my candidacy for European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and repressions that we observe by the Spanish government".
Londoners: Arrested men after the car got stuck in the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 respectively, were arrested after several times in a house in London.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 a.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings announced that there were damage both to the port and to the building itself.
It's also possible that he was shot in the car with an arbalette.
Menga's goal is to lead Livingstone's victory with 1-0 over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone ensures victory
The newcomer at the Livingston High League surprised Rangers and just put Stephen Jarard's second loss in his first 18th match as a manager of the "Ibrox" club.
The goal of the Dolly Menga has become decisive, and Gary Holt's team has been leveled at the second level in the Hibernion ranking.
Gerard's team remains without winning a foreign field in the High League during this season, and next week it's facing leader Harts, from which it's left with eight points in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone is already in a series of six games without losing in the championship, and manager Holt hasn't felt the taste of losing since he changed his post last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against homeless guests
Holt's team had to lead the result far before he scored the goal, and his direct play style was extremely difficult Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his strike went away, and then Alan Litgou shot across the grid after Craig Halket returned the ball with his head.
The housekeepers left Rangers to play the ball, knowing they could seriously make the guests of static positions difficult.
And that's exactly how it got to the winning goal.
Rangers committed a violation, and Livingstone played well, when Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined and performed Manga, who took his ball and scored from the middle of the criminal field.
Until now, Rangers have ruled the ball more, but they have met with the unprovoked protection of the hosts, and the doorman Lim Kelly was rarely supposed to intervene.
This style of game continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' doorman saved Scott Pittman's foot shot, and a hit on Littlelow's head passed by the door after another static situation for Livingstone.
In Livingstone’s criminal field, however, the centers were well-purified, and the judge twice ignored the claims of the guests for the dump – first after the unification between Halket and the Glen Middleton reserve, and then after the doubts about the game with the hand.
"Penomenal" by Livingstone – analysis
All right, all right, all right, all right.
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingstone.
The team's playing just superior, continuing to exceed expectations and improving its performance.
The style of the game and the composition almost did not undergo changes after the team returned to the High League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he changed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halket was amazing, organizing protection in a surpassing way, while Menga was constantly holding Connor Goldson and Joe Warley under pressure.
At the same time, Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
You know, under the guidance of Gerard, they're showing you some great things, but in case they were a lot under those standards.
They missed the last pass before they went naked, only once they managed to break up the protection of the hosts – this loss must wake Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan gets a funny reception in Kyoln.
On Saturday (29 September), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship is cold because of human rights issues, media freedom and Turkey's EU adoption.
Then Erdogan went to Kyle to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a 25-thousand crowd from meeting in front of the mosque, but, despite this, many supporters have flocked around and wanted to see their president.
Hundreds protesting against Erdogan, many of which Kurds have also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's own policy and the German government's decision to allow it to go to the country.
The various protests reflect a breach caused by a visitor who is accepted as a hero by some German Turks and is at the same time despised as a despot by others.
Travel disaster in Deptford: The Colosseum Rests After Car crash
A coroner died after a car crash in London.
The disaster was near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 a.m. British time.
The car driver stopped and got medical help, but the driver died on the spot.
The disaster occurs a few months after another coroner died, after being hit by a runaway driver on Childers Street, located close to a mile from the site of the Saturday disaster.
The city police report that her employees are working to identify the man, then inform his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are turned off, and it is also recommended to the motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards were injured in a riot
Six prison guards were injured in a male high-level prison rebellion, reported by the Prison Service.
The riot broke out in Long Lartin prison in Worchester at about 09:30 in the morning of British time on Sunday and is still going on.
For the purpose of its administration, special servants from the "Tordano" team are called, who will have to deal with eight persons deprived of their liberty, with their own interference in a limited to one wing of the prison.
The injured supervisors suffered slight injuries on the person and received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service made the following statement: “There are specially trained servants who will deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six supervisors have received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we state very clearly that responsible persons will be handed over to the police, as their sentences may be extended."
Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that after an attack by a prisoner, the director of the prison had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, police officers from the parts of the fighting of the riots were called into prison, where they were to have a heavy blow, where the personnel were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with lightning floods Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although the dried areas may benefit)
Arizona rarely happens to be hit by a tropical storm, but there is a great chance that this will happen early next week, while the weakening hurricane Rosa is being carried through the desert of the south-west, leading to a risk of lightning floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already established posts against lightning floods on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Phoenix on Tuesday, as she can bring rain in late Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “as far as 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona's border."
The latest models from the National Center for Hurricane Forecasts 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, as individual locations are possible up to 4 inches of rain.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the rain caused by Rosa can in fact be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, some of the rain will probably be useful, as the southwestern part is now in the drought.
According to the U.S. Drying Monitoring Commission, less than 40% of Arizona suffer from at least excessive drought, which is the second heavy category", reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to the land of the Baha California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which can still praise at the maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting with colder waters over the Pacific Ocean, and that's why it's getting weaker.
That is why it is expected to reach the drought in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of floods.
"Summer rains are expected from 6 inches from Baha California to northwestern Sonora, as they are possible up to 10 inches," weather.com reports.
Then Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah until Tuesday late evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely strong rain in Baha California, northwestern Sonora and the western southwestern United States," the National Hurricane Centre warns.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening floodwaters and various waste streams in the deserts, as well as landings in the mountain plains.
Attack in Midsummer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old child was discovered with stab wounds in Summerset.
The early boy was discovered in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Northton around 04:00 in the morning of British time on Saturday.
It is located in a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
During the night in the Radstock area, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested, reported by the police in Avon and Summerset.
The cops are asking anyone who might have shot what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kawanau "has suffered from shame and anger" of the democratic party
"Every vote for Judge Kawanau is a vote that rejects the harsh and disturbing tactics of the democratic party," trump said at a meeting in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kawanau "has suffered the humiliation and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Kawanau testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically rejecting Christine Blacie Ford's charge of sexual assault before decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution hearing.
The President made a statement on Saturday that "the American people today have witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities" of Kawanau.
"Every voice in support of Judge Kawanau is a voice in support of one of the brightest legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in the service of the public," the president said before the meeting a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president saw Kawanau's nomination indirectly while talking about the importance of republican votes in general elections.
"They leave five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I'm not a candidate, I'm actually also involved," Trump continued.
"That's why I'm going around and fighting in support of good candidates."
Trump noted that the Democrats had set themselves up as a mission "to prevent and impede".
The first key procedural vote in the Kawanau Senate is expected to be held not later than Friday, as reported by one of the co-workers of the High Representative of the Republican Party for CNN.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, number of victims increase
At least 384 people lost their lives, after many had been taken from the smaller coastal giant waves, when strong earthquakes and tsunamis defeated the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when the beach was observed on the evening, from waves up to six meters (18 feet), took many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami hits after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, so many became victims of the disaster," said at a briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the spokesperson of the Agency for Disaster Management of Indonesia's BNPB.
"The water had drawn its car, the trees, the whole house, hit everything on its way," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h), before hitting the shore.
"Some people returned to the trees and thus managed to escape the water," he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 centers in Palu.
Published by the Agency for Disasters images from the air showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, collected and torn bridges, as well as surrounded by the water of the mosque.
Secondary rabbits continued to hunt the coastal city on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes was reached in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) made a statement that the energy released from the Friday mass earthquake was about 200 times stronger than that released on Hiroshima nuclear bomb during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of the long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "great" and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the slums built, added the speaker, then added that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be higher on the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the truce.
He also added that "communications are completely cut off and there is no information from Dongala".
The red cross of its side indicated that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers have already moved to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy, but it can get even harder."
On Saturday, the agency was bitterly criticised for not being informed of the defeat of Palu tsunamis, although officials explained that the waves arrived during the announcement.
Shared in the social networks, love videos show a man on the top floor of the building who screams at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunamis.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall bursts into the shore and affects both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the clip in time.
Earthquake and tsunami have led to a severe interruption of electricity supply, which has stopped communications around Palo and thus made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, reported by the responsible authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other products of the first need.
The City Airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Pali on Sunday.
The deaths in the Indonesian tsunami are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision officials from Dongala managed to reach Palu safely, where they found shelter in the breezy cellars that were laid in the courtyard of their office, they passed a series of desert scenes, says Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the start of work on rescue and recovery emergency groups, some complain that those who have had a rich experience in such situations are prevented from reaching Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the financing, dispatch of foreign personnel and supplies can only be initiated if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The distress is still at regional level," said Aulia Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Since the government has announced that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but from there they have not yet declared such a status."
While above Palau falls the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national team for Indonesia's paraplanetics, has trained two of the missing paraplanetaries for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped in the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As an elder in the field of paraplaneism, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Hendon recalled that in the hours after the news of the Roa-Roa hotel crash, he reached the paraplaneism community, he was desperate to send messages on WhatsApp to the competitors in Palu who participated in a beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue notes, however, the only answer to his messages was the only one.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Thieves raise $26,750 while charging a ATM in Newport of Levi
On Friday morning, the thieves raised $26,750 from Brink's employee who was charging a ATM in Newport of Levi, and became clear from a press release from the police department in Newport.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM into the fun complex and prepared to charge it with money, says Detective Dennis Makarti in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “proceeded to walk behind Brink’s servant’s back and stole the bag with money.
The witnesses have noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the message continues, but the police have not indicated the number involved in the theft.
All those who have information about the identity of the suspects must contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name
Rapper Canyon West changes his name to her.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: "The man, officially known as the Canyon West".
West, in 41, for a while, has been wearing its key and used it as a title for its eighth album, which was released in June.
The change presupposes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He turns the song Ariana Grande into a show that refused "for emotional reasons", the show's creator tells us.
Except that it's a reduction in his current professional name, West, and he used to claim that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where "you" or "you," West said earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with the radio-leading Big Boy.
"That's how I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He moved from Kenya, which means only one person, simply to Him – which is a reflection of the good of us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is rather a reflection of our essence."
Rapper is one of many known in his field who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of hotkeys and names, including Puff Dadi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference to the pseudonyms Louv and Brother Louv.
One of the former West co-workers, J.Z., also presented himself in a version with or without a arrow and/or the main letters in his keyboard.
Mexico's president swears not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that he would never use military force, which happened as the country nears the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday of Tlatelolko Plaza President Lopez Obrador promised "never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration of the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people while students with left political views gradually spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador made a vow to support young Mexicans, providing monthly scholarships to students and discovering more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of the development of the EI
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the front of artificial intelligence development, the United States has to double its research budget in this area, claims the researcher and developer of II Kai-Fu Loy, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was sent after different calls from the U.S. government made statements on the topic for the II, although the US as a whole has no official strategy for the II.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: the country strives to become number 1 from innovations in the I.I. by 2030.
"The duplication of the IIA development budget will be a good start, given that all other countries are far away from the US and are about to make next II breakthroughs," Lee said.
The duplication of funding can also double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of II coming from the US, as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book "The II Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the lead executive director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies for II in China – Face++.
In the 80s last century at the University of Carnegie Melon Lee worked on the I.I. system, which won the most successful hotel player in America, after which he was executive director of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee is responsible for the past technological competitions of the federal government, such as the Agency's robotics competition for advanced defence research projects, and asked when the next one will be of help to identify the new visionaries.
"The researchers in the United States often have to work well to win government funding," explained Lee.
"Not China takes academic leaders, but corporations," said the husband.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights to work on I.I.
Lee also claims that the changes in immigration policy can help the US strengthen its II programme.
"I think that I.I. science doctors should automatically offer green maps," the husband said.
The US State Council announced its plan to develop an artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding for people from academic institutions in the same way as the National Scientific Foundation and other state organizations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, explains Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from industry and academic environments, and from the White House announced the establishment of a Special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA also announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, more than $100 million is now invested annually in the development of the I.I.
In the meantime, the US legislative body, which wanted to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not observed any activity for months.
Macedonians voting in a referendum to change the name of their country
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum this week whether the name of the country should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that would allow for a long-standing dispute with Greece, which blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, argues that its northern neighbour's name is a claim against its territorial integrity, which requires the veto of its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
Both governments have reached agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum himself, while the boycotting campaign casts a shadow as to whether the referendum will succeed in reaching the minimum 50 per cent required for recognition of its validity.
The issue of the Bulletins is as follows: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that his price deserves to be paid in order to achieve the entry of the formed after the collapse of the Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the country's future, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska, 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the results from it to such a degree that the vote is already critical.
In order to change the name of the country, two thirds of parliamentary representatives must therefore vote.
The National Electoral Commission reported that there were no reports of irregularities by 1 afternoon.
However, the electoral activity was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters visited the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Giose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen of Skopje capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will discover the way to join NATO and the European Union in Stromica on 30 September 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje Vladimir Kawadarkov in 54, he prepared a small stage and arranged chairs in front of the Chambers, surrounded by the boycotting referendums.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proud heads raised, not through the door for servants," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the European Union."
Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his own vote.
The State party also stated that the positive result would lead to "the confirmation of the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published results of the study that between 30% and 43% of voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the required focus.
Another study, the work of Macedonian TV Telma, reported that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote with "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum is unsuccessful, it will be the first serious attack on the pro-Western government's policy since it won power last May.
Watch: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes through the entire defense of Brighton and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling have overcome the protection of Briton and have won Manchester City with 2-0 on Saturday of "Ethihad Steidym" in Manchester, England.
Aguero's going naked in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine golfer was found with a dog in the middle of the field.
He ran three defenders from Brighton before he printed with the ball in the empty space ahead.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four players in green.
He slipped past one of the defenders, then left behind the rest of the Bryton criminal field.
Then he turned left to Sterling.
The English attacker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who struck with his right foot across the door of Bryton Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his door.
"Aguero fights with some contusions in his feet," City Pep Guardiola's manager told reporters.
"We planned he to play for about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky you noticed naked right now."
But Sterling was the one who secured the initial advance of the "heavens" in this match of the High League of England.
He posted in 29 minutes.
In the situation of naked Aguero, he received a deep surrender in half of Brighton's.
He immediately released the leading dog on the left flank to Liroy Sane.
Sone made progress with the ball, then found Sterling with a passport on the far grid.
The attacker of the "heavens" managed to hit close, just before the ball went out in the car.
City will face Hofenheim in a match from the group phase of the Championship League at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon at Rain Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to play certain fate of Rockies
After Nationals didn't qualify for the playoffs, there's no special sense for another match of a titular starter.
And yet the ambitious Shercer always hopes to be a titular Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the match is important to Rockies, who run a match with Los Angeles Dodgers in the ranking of NL West.
Rockies guaranteed their participation at least in the Wild Ward after winning with 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still not certain that they will win their first title in the division.
"Although we ourselves are not fighting for anything, we want to finish the season with a good match in Denver, where the audience and the other team will give everything of their own to win perhaps the most important match for them during the year.
Why would I want to miss such a match?"
Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but it is expected that they will allow Shercer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Shercer, this would be the 34th match as a starter this year, when he was practicing Thursday and would have the normal time to rest by Sunday.
Washington's right-hand drinker has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 inches during this season.
Trump recruits supporters in West Virginia
The President of Kosovo was instigating the situation with his electorate for the British Supreme Court while talking about the importance of Republican votes in the general elections.
"In November everything we have achieved will be at risk.
It leaves five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in the current history – I also say that even though I am not a candidate, I actually look at myself as well, that's why I'm fighting all the forces for the right candidates," Trump said.
Then he went on with, “All of you see this terrible radical group of democracies, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to restore their power in any way, you are themselves witnesses of their integrity, of their wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt, who they have to run, to get in power and control, because they're only interested in power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, according to the President, have set themselves the goal of "barring and hindering".
"What we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the democracies "stricken, ugly, ugly and unfaithful".
The president recalled the Senate Judicial Commission, mentioning the Senator of Democrats Diane Finnstein, in particular, which caused strong crowd riots.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the documents?
Please, what?
No, no, I've been waiting – it was a really bad gesture – maybe the worst thing I've ever seen."
The labyrinths are no longer wide open.
The party is not tolerant to those who speak openly.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, a few were surprised.
At the end of the day, I'm just the last member of Parliament of the Liberals, who was declared not to be welcome – just because I speak out loud.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, has had a similar attitude, since he was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticises me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy expressed disagreements during the days of previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labers meeting said Friday that "we want the meetings to include all and be useful".
During most of my eight years as a local representative of the libertarians in Parliament, Friday meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and the promises of a "lighter and more moderate" policy have long been forgotten if ever they were on the agenda.
It became increasingly evident that the different views were not tolerated in the Liberian party and that any opinion was assessed on the basis of this as much as the party's leadership liked it.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I worked for before I thought they shared similar political views began to expect me to turn around and take positions that I would never agree with – whether on national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I'm actually saying – there's a whole bloody tyranny in the social networks, where it's called for a response, a rejection of moderate politics, statements that they don't belong to the libertarians.
It's not just me.
In the interest of the truth, I know that I have even drawn more luck from some of my colleagues, since the comments for me are at least primarily of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and focus of these colleagues who face sexist or racist subjects every day, without being afraid of them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this era in politics is how such abuses have become the norm.
Last week Jeremy Corbin said the liberators must embrace the culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer wide-ranging, with any sign of mistrust or change in the rules of choice becoming increasingly tighter.
In the last two years, I've got a lot of advice to bend, not talk so much and then "everything will be fine".
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Laberists 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Thacher government, which through neglect led to a physical breakdown of my excellent school, I fought for better public services for those who needed them most – either as a local adviser or as a minister.
I have never concealed my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way from my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state met with Brexit, it would harm the households, companies and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the liberators.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the liberators, or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of withdrawal or political rejection will deny me the way I consider it best to protect your interests.

Eer 38-17 Melrose: The Invincible Eer led the ranking
The two late essays may have changed slightly the final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match from Tennent's High League.
The team is already heading the ranking and the only ten teams are without loss to the moment.
The better protection and the better use of the possibilities have become decisive in the match, from which coach Peter Murchi and his team can be very pleased.
"I'm happy because the other teams tested us very seriously in the previous matches, and we're still without loss," Mr. Murchi noted.
Robin Kristi of Melrose said: "Congratulations for Eer, they really took advantage of their position better than us."
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional hit by Frasier Klimo, led Air ahead in the result, but a yellow card for the Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play in the Waryers match, allowed Melrose to join the result after Jason Bagot realized the essays followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
Klimo increases the lead for Eer from a penalty hit shortly before half time, marking the axles after salt action, and then realizing the additional impact that made the result 17-5 for Eer on rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional blow to Bagot, reduced the front to only five points.
The game was followed by a prolonged stop due to the heavy contusion of Ruarid Nott, which was carried out on the carrier, and after the renewal of the match Eer increased their progress after the essays of Staffard McDoual and a successful additional blow to Klimo.
Then, the active Captain of Eer Blair Mcferson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerous advantages, becoming a strong pressure and realized the essays through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
However, the hosts returned the presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card, after gathering Klimo without a ball, from the subsequent criminal removal of Makferson realized essays using the advanced offensive line of Air.
Klimo realized the additional blow, and not long after he did it again, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kicked ball and pulled Gregor Henry's wing off the flag for the fifth axle of the hosts.
The star of Still Game appears to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business
The star of Still Game Ford Kiernan appears to have directed himself to a more direct and warmer industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in BBC's popular broadcast, which is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last for the surrender, and it seems that Kirnan is already planning his life after Creeglang.
According to the official registers, he is director of Aeringmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan intended to be involved in the Glazgou's "breathing restaurant business".
"The sea is ours": the absence of a sea exit Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Marines are constantly patrolling the occupiers with an assembling sea headquarters in La Paz.
Above the public buildings are the ocean son of a flag.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by law.
It's our duty to bring it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit, handed over to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – as well as the call to sail again from the Pacific.
In fact, this hope is now stronger than decades ago, while Bolivia is waiting for a sentence from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after it has been considered for five years.
"The force is in Bolivia, wherever it feels loyalty and unity, as the country expects a positive result," said Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Kaldazila.
Many Bolivians will see the condemnation of the international court of the big screen all over the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's request and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Here Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is about to go to the contested battle for re-election next year, has also invested much and much in the judgment of the court on Monday.
"We are very close to returning access to the Pacific," Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the probability of the court making a decision for Bolivia is quite small, and even if it did, it would not change things in reality.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to take over Chile and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgement of the international court is only six months after hearing the last arguments indicates that the case "is not complex", says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
"The problem of access to the ocean was separated from the current Bolivian government," Zarat said.
After that, he suggested that the military rhetoric of Morales looked different and that Chile's little good will remained.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at a given time, but it will be extremely difficult after normal dialogue has taken place.
Both sides do not support diplomatic missions each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Welltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was made unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday, Bolivia will have "the incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile", as well as the chance to "stop 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both countries".
Kaldazila also rejected the idea that Morales, who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the problem of accessing the ocean as a "political paterja".
"Bolivia will never give up its right to exit the Pacific," he added.
"The conviction is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims it won't continue with nuclear disarmament until it can't believe the US
North Korea Foreign Minister Yong Ho says his country will never resort to nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after the US Secretary of State Mike Pompey appears to be at the edge of relaunching the infinitive nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting with Kim Young Un from North Korea.
Ri called the "empty hope" the idea that continuing with US sanctions and objections to a declaration to end the Korean War would make the North fall on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the declaration without Phanyan first making a significant gesture on the way to disarmament.
Both Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Phanyan they are serious about their rejection of the arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phanyan next month to arrange for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion reviews in Paris reveal the latest song on massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sunlight, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which laughed at the fashion podium during the Fashion Week in Paris.
I caused a lot of non-practical hats in Instagram during the summer, when designers sent in the eyes of their creations to lure the fashion community.
Valentine's exploding proposal was an extravagance escape hat with a popular periphery of wide periphery, which literally swallowed the heads of the models.
The other too huge accessories included decorated with jewels, magic hat and even pineapple – but they are not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – at exactly the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had covered lips and reminded not as much about the tall fashion as Hannibal Lekter.
One of the designers liked a snorkeling equipment in a full set of snorkels and glasses, while the other looked like a hot funnel ice cream.
If you fall for such fashion trends, you're lucky.
Modern specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold at fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come very soon after "La Bomba" – the slender hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on the heads of all – from Riana to Emily Ratajovski.
The cult to the extremely impractical hat that took over social networks led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashion floor – a slender beach bag, almost as large as wearing it with a bath model.
The bag of rafiya with the color of the roasted orange, with resiny rafiya and rubbed with a white handle, was the attractive all-seeing article in the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Famousist Luke Armitid said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for drug accessories. ”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic distinction, which continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the test results, which is only enhanced by individual and collective success in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS) aim to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can form and implement a personal training program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language that you understand, your words will reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are first of all with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved high grades A.
The data collected from 74 students in SCIS schools show that 72% of students achieved a Chinese A score, with the same score being 72% of German students, 69% of French and 63% of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland accept foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
At the moment, languages as a free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural-material disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) as in the programmes of independent schools and beyond.
In 2014, the UK Employment Commission and Labour Skills survey showed that for reasons that employers are difficult to find employees, 17% have indicated insufficient language skills.
That is why the growing rule of foreign languages becomes necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the rule of a foreign language, which makes these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future after he masters such skills that remain for the rest of his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruling few languages in front of competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 full-time citizens of the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not have a foreign language well enough to be able to speak a language, as French was the only language whose governance reached a double-digit percentage of 15%.
That's why the investment in language learning is important to the children now.
The rule of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will differ from taught languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their area.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, regardless of what the future holds.
At the moment it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country, which requires this to be taken into account in the educational system.
Indeed, modern languages must really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, together with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done well.

Lebron will make his debut for Lakers this week in San Diego.
Waiting's almost over for the fans who can see Lebron James's first match with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers Luke Walton's coach announced that James would take part in the first match of the pre-season team against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still not specified how many minutes he'll play in the double.
"It'll be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," Walton said through Lakers' official website.
The reporter for Lakers Mike Trudel told Tweeter that James would probably play a relatively few minutes in the match.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the six matches from Lakers' pre-season training.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season matches to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of election meetings tonight at Wyling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned trump meetings, which include stops at known places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By deferring the vote for its election to fill the free space in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the forthcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republics are threatened by the loss of control over the Congress in the submission of the votes in November.
What time will the Trump meeting be held in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wyling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours, east time tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wyling, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump will probably review this week's hearings for the Bret Cavano Supreme Court nominations, in which tensions arose due to allegations of immoral sexual activity, which held the Senate's confirmation vote for one week while the FBI's investigation was ongoing.
However, the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans build energy for the November elections.
That is why President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five-minutes in the next week are aimed at "activizing volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for its programme that the President will visit as many states as possible and we start a campaign season with commitments," Reuters spokesperson for the Trump campaign, which refuses to be mentioned.
The meeting, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wyling tonight, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, the second trip to Trump for this month will take place in West Virginia – the state in which it won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Republican Patrick Morrisi, who remains in the sociological studies.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisi that the president came to give him a boost in social research," said Simon Heather, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
"Rader Cup" 2018: US team will fight to the last, keeping its hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without an intrigue of "foursome" matches on Sunday afternoon may have brought what it needed "Rader Cup".
Changing the advantages of sport is a rather subjective concept, in which players believe unconditionally, even more in competitions like this one.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They led with six points, and now they're just four, so I guess we've got a little bit of energy," Jordan Spyt said at the end of today's competition day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage at only twelve more to distribute.
As Spyt says, however, Americans have something else to show, and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge in the sport form of Spyt and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Spite shows a great shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The encouraging screams of the fans became stronger as he progressed in the round, in which with a precise blow he balanced the result in the fourth match, after remaining with Thomas with two strikes after the first two holes.
His hit, which won their 15th hole, was met with strong exasperated reactions that make us believe that not everything is really lost for the American team.
"It's important that you don't think about anything else and focus on your own match," says Spyt.
That's all that's left to these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points from Spite and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitoud, the unquestionable heroes of "Rader Cup" so far.
The strange but amazing couple from Europe won four out of four and seemed to get them all.
Molywood was the only couple who didn't make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "goods" on Saturday mornings, or Friday afternoons or mornings.
These successive successes, as well as the way that energy was passing between them and the enthusiastic fans, confirmed the view that they were the players who would win Sunday and there would be no better couple than Flitoud and Molinari, who would bring the potential victory of Europe while the sun rises over Le Golf National.
To prefer both at the same time to different holes.
However, the stories of European glory have become a little premature.
Boba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball matches in the morning, while he was partnering with Alex Norren.
"Gods" and two "devils" on the first nine holes have brought Spanish and Swedish into problems they have failed to cope with.
But there's no way anyone else can solve your problems during the week.
Fourball and Foursomem match are extremely interesting to look around because of the interaction between the two, the councils that exchange between each other, and the way in which a strategy can undergo changes at any moment.
Europeans played better teammates, so they got a significant lead before the last day, but this foursome match session showed that the American team is also ready to fight until the last – something in which many people, especially in the United States, were deeply suspicious.
Europe leads with 10-6 in the last day of "Rader Cup".
Europe will have a solid front before the last day of the "Rader Cup", after taking the United States with 10-6 after playing the matches of the "fireball" and "firesam" formats on Saturday.
The inspiring duet of Tommy Flitoud and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, with which their assets in the Le Golf National race grew to four points.
In an attempt to return to the trophies that lost Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn dominated the morning fireball matches over Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and finally Europe won the 3-1 win series.
The U.S. was more opposed to the foursome matches, where they won two victories, but they failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furick's team needs 8 points of the 12th single game on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was Europe's first new winner, won four points in the row, and he and Molinari, known as "Molywood", after this sensational weekend became only the second couple, won four points from their first four matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After calling Woods and Patrick Reid in the "fireball" matches, they were extremely motivated to defeat Woods and American novelist Bryson Decambu with an even more categorical result of 5&4.
Woods, who barely passed through his two matches on Saturday, only occasionally demonstrated his genius's highlights, but so far there are 19 losses from 29 matches in the "fireball" and "fires" matches, as well as seven consecutive losses in total.
Justin Rose, who got a break for the morning's "Fireball" matches, partnered with Henrik Stanson in the "Firesham" matches with the 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copka – a number one and number three in the world, respectively.
The European team, however, failed to enjoy a totally pleasant, cold and cloudy day south-west of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a hard victory with 2§1 against the Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in the "fireball" matches, and later they returned to win Polter and Rory Macilroy with 4&3 in the "four" meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the "Rader Cup" has been a team to raise four points of deficit before the singles, and according to the rules, the Furik team will hold a trophies even at equality.
However, once they were overrun in two consecutive days, their chances of turning on Sunday were not particularly high.
North Korea says "no way" to disarm unilaterally, with no confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea announced to the UN on Saturday that the continued sanctions are deepening the lack of confidence in the US and there is no way for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world organisation Ri Yong-how said that in recent years "significant measures of good will have been taken", for example, we halt nuclear and missile testing, destroy nuclear testing and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction by the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and, under no circumstances, there is no first way of disarming ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri expressed known complaints from North Korea about Washington's "step-by-step" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps, the statement seemed significant, as it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Phanyan did in the past.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", and Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea strives for the official end of the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States says that Phanyan must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington also met with calls to facilitate strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists "first to remove nuclear weapons" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The realization that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who don't know us.
The problem, however, is that continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting is planned between Kim and Trump, for which the US leader stressed earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister focuses on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jain over the past five months and adds: “If the country on nuclear disarmament was South Korea, rather than the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a halt.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from that of the previous year when he told the UN general assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States is inevitable, after "the evil president" Trump called Kim a "human missile" on a suicide mission.
This year in the UN Trump, which threatened North Korea last year with "full destruction", praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still much work and sanctions to remain in force while North Korea removed nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump stressed that there is no time for this and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Phanyan for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must definitely continue until complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop financing the Phanyan nuclear programme and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Ri in the basements of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Phanyan again next month to prepare a second summit meeting.
This year Pompey visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Phanyan in July with the words that he had made progress, but only a few hours later North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
At the meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the "responsible measures" he sought are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard for sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year leads all students to sleep more in an effort to overcome the growing culture of learning "all night" with the help of caffeine.
The teacher found that students at the university number one in the world often don't even think when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Hospital in Brigam and the Women's Hospital, prepared a course he thinks is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep loss on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said, "Why are they telling me so far, in my last year?"
She said no one ever told her the importance of the dream that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the most important about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barryra, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course, after finding out that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
At the same time, the course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is an image of a room in a neighborhood where students click on coffee cups, curtains, marathons and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are influenced by the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleeping routine.
Another part of the participants tell how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of the choice to smoke," added Professor Kaysler.
The culture of pride from "learning all night" still exists, he says and adds that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that getting rid of sleep is a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficient and quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says – even to avoid filling, as the elimination of sleep in a mode of hunger that keeps them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaysler in the preparation of the course, taking one of his classes in Harvard his first year.
He says his course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is to ask all students to complete such a training programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaysler recommends students to consider whether to set up a bedtime alarm and wake up and to know the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can upset the circular rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal has undermined Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Stephen Jarard's immediate team and won a 1-0 win for Livingstone.
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory as a triumphal guest in February 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team had just suffered the second defeat of Gerard in his 18ths as a manager, who left his team with eight points less than Harts, a leader in the High League of Ladbrokes.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the lack of constructive ideas from Rangers' team at no point seemed close to the equation.
After the Rangers match, they're in the sixth place, and Livingstone is already third, leaving Himbernian second only on the head.
For Rangers there may also be additional problems, since the side judge Kalum Spence got a head wound after he was hit with an object that was obviously thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that broke Air into the semifinals of the Battle of Scotland League.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same unit of Livingstone, who pulled the point against Harts last week, and should be satisfied with the way his aggressive team was parring all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingstone did better in the rarest cases when they owned it.
They were supposed to note in the second minute, when Menga took a shot at Scott Pittman against doorman Alan McGreeger, but half-protector missed the opportunity.
Later, Keegan Jacobs' focus on the mob found Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense Alan Litgou turned the ball away from the back line.
Rangers took control of the game, but they couldn't create anything in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought there should be a dump in the 15th minute when he met Stephen Loules, but the reference Stephen Thompson rejected the claims of the Colombian.
Rangers had only two precise hits in the first half, but the ex-doorman from Ibrax Liam Kelly had an easy hit with the head of Lasana Kulibali and the weak shot of this Edjaria.
Although Livi's attack in the 34th minute was surprising in view of the ball's possession, it was absolutely deserved.
Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' deep focus again.
Scott Arfield doesn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who gave cold blood to Manga, for which it was easy to realize.
Gerard responded to the break, changing Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately led to the result when the wing handed over to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out resolutely and blocked the strike.
Livingstone, however, continued to force guests to play comfortably for the home style of the game, as Litgou and Halket constantly rejected the sent forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor managed to deal with Jacobs' strike, and with the next corner of Litgou shot his head across the grid.
The one who entered the Glen Middleton reserve from Rangers was looking for a hole at the end of the double after a single fight with Jacobs, but Thompson didn't see anything wrong again.
Anniversary: The inventor of the gay numerator
A page from our annual Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day the future physicist Johan Wilhelm "Hans" Gaiger was born in Germany.
Gaiger develops a method of drying and measuring radioactivity, invention, which ultimately leads to the creation of the device, known as the Gaiger's counter.
A corner stone in science since then, the gay numerator also became a corner stone of pop culture, when in 1950 the film "Cornado Campanas" appeared, in which the amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans apparently participated.
Man: “What is this thing about God?
Rogers: It's a gaiger numerator and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these hearing aids, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated by the radioactive activity in the minerals."
Evans: "Surely shoots right now!"
Hans Gieger died in 1945, only a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live on.
New cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise foreign cells as part of treatment
The method includes removing immune cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory
Then they can "see" a protein that's common to many types of cancers and inject into the patient again.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes removing immune cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory so that they can "see" protein, common to many types of cancers called HER2, and then injecting again into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Betezada, Maryland: "The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including the breast, ovaries, white lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and their "training" how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kenny West delivered a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the inscription "Let's make America big again," in our participation in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was released at the studio during Saturday Night Live, after making a meaningless performance in which US President Donald Trump praised him and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Let's make America big again," he announced against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
"I talk very often to white people and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which the Hollywood star took on Brett Kawan's testimony before the Senate Legal Commission on Sexual Violence Complaints by Kristin Blazi Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the record of West performance was uploaded to social networks by the comic book Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to play West with his publication.
Besides, West complained in front of the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They tortured me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go out with this hat."
They tortured me!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming that it will wear Superman's costume, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love."
The comments provoked at least twice the public and the members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, reports Variety, as one of them said: "The whole studio is closed."
West was invited at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
Wet puzzles many with the performance of the song "I Love it", dressed as a bottle "Perie".
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Kandes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "On one of the bravest: Thank you for making the most of it."
However, the lead stream of Karen Hunter's show wrote on Twitter that West simply "was himself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (such as buying his music or clothing or supporting his "artificial") for whom I think he welcomes and distributes an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are, too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, as now "is officially known as Kenny West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows the example of Didi, also known as Puff Didi, Puffi and Pi Didi.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dog, was called Snoop Lion, and the music legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.
Charge for attempted murder after stabbing a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The accused is expected to appear before the Magistrate Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of "Igran a Thrones" Kit Harrington is against toxic manhood
Kit Harrington is known for the role of John Snow's waving sword in full with violence of a medieval fantasy series of the NGO "Play of Thrones".
But the actor, who is 31 years old, turned against the stereotype of the cat hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen often leads young people to think that they should be "stupid" in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed that "something was wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the "Tron game" Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admits that she feels "strongly convinced", that this problem must be solved.
"I am personally convinced – what have we confused about humanity?" he said.
"What do we teach grown-up men about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic manhood due to a lot of male personalities.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What is taught by television and the street that drives the boys to feel they have to turn into this particular type of man?
I think this is really one of the big issues of our time – how can we change it?
'Cause obviously something's wrong with the young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in the prehistoric or continuation of the "Tron game" after the end of the series next summer, arguing that he "ended with the battlefields and horses".
From November Kit will play part in the recovery of Sam Shephard's "True West", a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently said that dating his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in the Throne Game.
"I met my wife in this series, so he gave me my future family and determined my life ahead," he said.
Rose plays the game, the girl who loves Keith John Snow's hero, in the fantasy show, wearing Amy's award.
The two married in June 2018 in the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump on the number of people living with HIV and spin.
According to health services, more than 820,000 people have been affected.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 around 40,000 new cases have been reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contacts, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way is almost zero, said China's health services at a conference in the province of Yunan.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and spin in China is increasing by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGB communities has been widespread.
According to studies on conservative values, 70-90% of men who had sexual contacts with men are ultimately married to women.
Many cases of transmission of diseases are due to inadequate protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that there is a leak of senators from the Republican Party, he binds "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, a member of the US Chamber of Representatives Maxine Waters condemned the charges that a member of her team had published personal information to three state senators from the Republicans of the sites of the legislators in Wikipedia.
Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by experts and sites on the "ultra right wing".
"Truths, lies, and other disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsay Gram from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Uta.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate hearing of the Senate's composition on the charges of sexual misconduct against a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kawanau.
Disappearance is effective after the three senators have questioned Kawanau.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState announced that the IP address that identified the source of the publications was linked to the Waters office, and they released information about her team, according to Hill.
"This unwarranted claim is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and false claims – is in no way responsible for the disappearance of this information.
This unwarranted claim is completely false and absolutely a lie."
Waters' statement quickly provoked online criticism, including from the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flasher.
"In this denial there is poison," wrote Flasher.
"This implies that it does not have a temperature suitable for a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
It's not supposed to be challenging.
I shouldn't question the defendant's motives.
He must be calm and balanced."
Flasher compared Waters' reaction to the criticism by judges Kawano's demonstrators, who was accused by critics, that he also seemed angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a candidate from the Republicans for the Waters place in the mid-elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Really, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had examined the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
Johnny English magazine exploded again – the weak spy parade with Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for transfers to Brexit in every new film with British participation, and it seems that this also applies to the reincarnation of the exhensible, spy French for Johnny English – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English coming back.
Will the self-rejection and myths that say how obvious it is that we are stupid become a new possibility for the export of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with round eyes and a "gummy" person has the permission to repeat things for the second time – his name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a large comical creation intended for viewers of cinema who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent, who despite his strange claims has a little of cluzo, a little of Mr Bein and a large part of the man who contributed with a note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.
In addition, it is initially based on the chaos of leaving behind a traveler and an international man who Atkinson plays in Barclaycard's already forgotten television ads.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there are two good times.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, carrying in a medieval armour, and for a short time the feathers stuck in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to the physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strange, especially when "serious" films like "007" and "Mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
The humour seems more focused on children than on adults, and Johnny English's mutilated accidents, I think, are not innovative and focused, as Actinson's game reminds Mr. Bein.
The current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked the British super secret network of spies and discovered the identity of all operational agents for the horror of the duty agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the premiere, which is a sudden and humid figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives everything of his own for this quazi-Tereza-May role, but in the scenario there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that she should call some retired agent, as all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a school teacher in a chess center, who, however, illegally teaches lessons about how to be a covert agent: there are some good attacks here when English presides over a spy rock academy.
English has been called to Whitehall for rapid instruction and meets again with his former long-term assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man, married to a watertight commander, a fun role in which Vicki Pepperdin's talent is little ply.
Thus, Batman and Robin are again in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret services and meet the fatal beautiful Offelia Bouletova, played by Olga Kurileenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technological billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their adises of Fars: dressed as servants, burn a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak into the luxury island of Volta; and English causes real anarchy when trying to use helmet for virtual reality to know the interior of the Volta house.
All the jokes are definitely taken from the previous movie, but since so nice and loud, there's a lot more content here for children.
A lot of intermediate production.
Like other films about Johnny English, I keep thinking: Can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
The labers deny that they're developing a plan for British people to work four days a week, but get paid for five days a week.
Jeremy Corbin's labyrinth party is thinking about a radical plan that tells British to work four weeks, but get paid for five.
The party argues that it wants the company's bosses to provide the savings made by the revolutionary artificial intelligence (III) to the workers, giving them another day of rest.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
The sources say that the idea of the economic programme and the party's plans would be "hazardy" to decompose the country for the benefit of the workers.
The move to a four-day work week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A higher source of the Liberian party told The Sunday Times: “It is expected to be announced before the end of the year for policy review.
"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day work week is an effort that is included in the approach to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Liberian Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day work week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this pursuit does not meet the approval of the entire Liberian party.
Laberist speaker said: "The four-day work week is not in the party's policy I don't think about it."
The shadow Chancellor John McDonald used the last week's liberal conference to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to take power back from the "unfair directors" and "speculiants" in the utilities.
The plans of the chancellor in the shadow also mean that the present owners of shares in the water supply companies may not receive their full share, as the Liberian government could impose "arms" on the basis of the established violations.
He also confirmed the plans to put workers on board companies and create privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net capital of private companies to employees who can accumulate annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak "60 minutes ago" if the investigation of Cavana by the FBI can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Bret Cavano slowed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised the question whether the Bureau's findings could cause some of the senators of the Republican party to withdraw their support.
In an interview, released Sunday, the correspondent of "60 minutes" Scott Pelly asked the senators of the Republican John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
After the incident, after that statement came out, I called him and asked, “Did you do it? ”
He was decisive, categorical and unequivocal."
However, Graham's voice seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion on Brett Cavano and to change it, a dissuasive charge is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it," Gram added, turning to Christine Blasy Ford.
"And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the “Global Citizens” festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday New York will host the festival "Global Citizens", an annual music event that has an impressive composition of performers and also performs such an impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Festival "Global citizen" will gather tens of thousands of people of the great sea in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but will also meet the real goal of the event – the removal of extreme poverty by 2030.
The "Global Citizens" festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (except if you don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" as a voluntary participation, sending email to a world leader, phone call or contact in another way to help raise awareness of their poverty eradication target.
But how successful is a "Global citizen" 12 years before it reaches its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert is a brilliant way to be convinced to demand action or is simply another case of so-called "clitivism" – people think they do something meaningful when they sign online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, "Global citizen" has recorded more than 19 million "acts" from its supporters, who insist on many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to declare commitments and policies of more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and messages arising from its actions, which have already been paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group believes that the funds provided have already directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include "Food Force", established in the UK partnership between investors and performers, engagement with "helping children develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 posts on Twitter from "global citizens".
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into just a historical note," said the envoy of the "Food Force" Tracy Ulman in front of the live concert audience in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken, which call on Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, "The Power of Food", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the CZVs on his website, asking "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"Global citizen" answers: This will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we will fail and we will fail again.
But as with the big civil rights movement and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year's New York event, which will lead to Deborah-Ley Fernes and Hu Jackman.
The US can use military forces to "block" and block energy exports – the Minister of Interior
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its military forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering the markets, including the Middle East, as US Interior Minister Ryan Zink quoted Washington Examiner as saying.
Zink argues that Russia's commitment to Syria – more specifically, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, as they did in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our military forces, ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed the events organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is represented as "the voice of energy users" in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, to stimulate and replace the fuel," he said, while at the same time defining Russia as "one-number pony", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration has the task of strengthening the export of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project for the North Stream 2 pipeline, which has, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a hostage.
Moscow stressed several times that the $11 billion pipeline of "North Stream 2", which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's burning opposition to the project is simply for economic reasons and is an example of untrustworthy competition.
"I believe that we share the view, energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), called for the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI, after a recent meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the presidential nomination in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "take a serious look" at the presidential nomination after the mid-term elections.
During a city council in Holioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that I was considering applying.
"It's time for women to enter Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November I will take a serious look at the presidential nomination."
Warren expressed his appreciation for President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he “directed this country in the wrong direction.
"I am anxious to the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was exposed in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Cavano.
In a post on Twitter Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a sociological study conducted on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that it should be applied in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be nominated, according to the study of Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
Social research has shown more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the democratic party, discussed on potential candidates in 2020, include former Vice President Joe Baiden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he'd make an official decision in January, reported Associated Press.
Sara Palin pointed out a PTR on the Trek Palin meeting for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his registration in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What passes through my own son, after he has returned, is known to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some of the wounds that soldiers are coming to us with," she told the audience at the meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they are returning a little changed, corroded, returning and wondering if they will receive this respect that they and their brothers have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska and accused of assault and domestic violence against women, was included in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in an emergency, according to Dan Bennet, spokesperson for Vasil's police administration.
18 states and districts in Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the area of Colombia support the judicial challenge of a new US policy that rejects the refuge of victims of gangster and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of the 18 states and the county submitted a request for good will in Washington in support of the asylum seekers and contesting the policies reported by NBC News.
The full name of the petitioner on the "Greys v. Sessions" case has not been disclosed, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed against the federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of the cruel members of his gang" abused her, but US officials rejected the request for asylum on 20 July.
She's been detained in Texas.
The state lawyers who are helping Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers come to the United States, such as nations facing all-encompassing gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy returned the decision of the 2014 Immigration Appeal Council, which allowed immigrant documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District attorney Colombia Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be examined in accordance with specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle," the report says in good faith.
In addition, lawyers claim in the report that the policy that refuses to join immigrants is harmful to the American economy, arguing that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work hand."
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration courts to stop providing asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gangster violence.
"Refugees are given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political convictions," Sessions said in its communication of 11 July on politics.
The asylum was never meant to ease all the problems – not all the serious ones – that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, while the death cases are doubled during the search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick boy in an evacuation center in the desert city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance carries more bodies.
Clean water is dirty."
The inhabitants are noted to return to their ruined homes to try to save something from their floodwaters.
Hundreds of people are injured, and the hospitals injured by the earthquake with a magnitude 7.5 are filled.
Some of the victims, including Two Harris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, were found outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are treated openly due to the ongoing secondary traumas.
His eyes are filled with tears when he remembers how he felt the severe earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I think I was pressed in the destroyed wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with his family to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then I shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accused China in a "screaming" with "propaganda"
One week after an official newspaper in China released an ad on four pages in an American daily on the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, US envoy in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday US President Donald Trump called for a paid publication of China Day at Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the elections for the American Congress on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Peggy is trying to interfere with the US Congress's election, noted what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to issue commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in a escalating trade war, in which they balance import tariffs between countries.
According to U.S. and China experts at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which support the Republic of Trump.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and a former long-standing Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods for China, said Beijing had harassed US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in a comment in the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "now doubles this brake by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the government of China has benefited from the respected tradition of freedom of speech and the press in America, placing a paid advertisement at the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In contrast, on a newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see a true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He adds that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish" his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With the Kawano massacre, the Republicans reject women's voters for inter-elections, warning analysts
As many of the high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend the nominations for the British Supreme Court of Cape Town regarding several charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that there would be a response, particularly from women, during the forthcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions around the board are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue to vote.
These things can't be returned," said Grant Racher, professor of politics at Maxwell School at the University of Siracusa, in front of The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Rahr said he doubted whether the last moment of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s insistence on an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jean-Pier, senior advisor and national speaker for the Progressive Group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington's newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters ran "Noemvri comes!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as the Republicans who control the judicial commission decided to continue with the nomination of Cavano despite the testimony of Dr. Kristin Blasy Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be ruled out," Steu Rottenberg, a party political analyst, told the news.
"The people say that the problem is already serious; that is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among voters of women in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years, who often do not vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public witness testimony describing her sexual assault charges against the nominations for the Supreme Court, analysts assume that she can follow a response if the Republicans insist on confirmation of the candidacy.
"This turned into a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Party, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the voting of the committee, the final vote or whether Kawano is placed on the scale. It is about how the Republicans deal with this and how they deal with it," Gai Cesil, director of Priorities USA, told the news channel, a group that helps to choose democracies.
The Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided on the question of who to believe as a result of Ford's and Kawano's demonstrations, with a little more tending to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe in Kawano.
In addition, 38 percent say that according to them, Kavano probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claim the same for Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath before the Senate's judicial commission that Cavano attacked her in an emergency when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genitals before her while they were at a party during her follow-up in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web Team Burners-Ley starts a launch aimed at rivaling Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a company that builds the platform with an open code of Burners-Ley Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Lei, the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the beginning.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "online storage of personal data" or POD.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through every browser, and at the same time is all of them simultaneously.
The unique online storage of personal data is that the user determines who has access to the information.
The company calls it "give power to personal data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Burners-Ley, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers, concluded a project work contract, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Ley said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a full change, or not, when all their business models are completely updated for one night.
"We don't want permission from them."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday Burners-Ley wrote that the mission of Inrupt is to provide energy for trade and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid base.
In 1994 Burners-Ley transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burners-Ley has had a strong impact on the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although Inrupt starts, Burners-Leie will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," Burners-Leie added.
Bernard Van: In the memory of the priest, honored with the cross Victoria during World War I
They mark 100 years in the native city of the only Anglican priest, worthy of the cross Victoria for his participation in warfare during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van won the September 29, 1918 prize in the Bellengise and Lehaucourt attack.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing that he was worthy of the highest military honors of the United Kingdom.
A memorial monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandsons on a parade in Rušden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years from his grandfather's case, decorated with a medal.
According to London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from artillery and cartels."
Later, he attacked the fire line and with "incredibly bravery" led the building ahead before attacking an artillery weapon with one hand and beating three of the squad.
Lieutenant Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, placed a wedding after the parade, led by Burnwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the maturity of the true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Pappa Pig
Imagine that all night long you are waiting to watch a full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you cannot become witnesses to the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 doubles, including six of the main cards and had to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised when the transmission changed to Pappa Pig.
Some were disappointed when they were built up to the early hours, especially due to the twins.
Fine description on Twitter of switching the child's animation film as "some kind of painful joke".
"The board regulates that this content is not appropriate at 6 p.m., so the program was changed with child transmission," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communications of Bellator, in response to the issue of broadcasting.
"Peppa pig", yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Kocker said they would work on planning the meetings to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"There is, however, six mornings a week and there is no way to plan things so that the event will take place here on Sundays and there – on Mondays.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages, and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't that kind of government.
I can promise you next time this won't happen.
We will stick to the inclusion of five doubles instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we crossed.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt "less" because of his sexuality
The Olympic Water Jumper Tom Dale says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman claims that until he started to study in high school, he didn't realize that "not all are like me."
In an interview on the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavren, he spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
The permanent leader of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, is in hospital for a few months.
In his first performance at Lavern Daily's, he said he felt "less" than all the others while he was growing up, as "it wasn't socially acceptable to like girls and boys."
He said: “The feeling of inferiority and the fact that I am different from others is, in fact, the things that give me energy and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, so I didn't disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic Bronze Medalist became an active participant in LGBT's campaigns and used its participation in the British Community's Australia Games this year to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he is happy that he can live openly, without consequences and wants to inspire "hope" of others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Blake, whom he met in 2013 – he was "surprisingly surprised."
Dale concluded a marriage with Oscar's carrier, who was 20 years older than him last year, but claimed that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you go through so much while you're so young" – he is the first time in the 14th Olympic Games, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said, "it's hard to find someone of your age who has experienced such withdrawals and falls."
Both of them became parents in June, and they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Dale says "his whole view of peace" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would tell you that I'd only be interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was baptized by his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dale told me that his father couldn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about is whether he already had tickets for the London Olympics in 2012 – as he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be with me, Dad, or in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until I stopped breathing and at this moment when I realized that he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not harmless," he said.
The following year, Daily competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that I had been dreaming about it all my life – to jump to the Olympics in front of the audience at home. There was no more fearful feeling," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song – "Proud" by Heather Small – which accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympics and still makes him stumble.
Desert Island Disks is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer time.
The lost form of Mikelson is left on the Rider Cup scale on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match at the Raider Cup, but he will have to return his old form if he doesn't want his record to be linked to a failure.
Mikelson, who took part in the two-year event for the 12th record, was left on Captain Jim Furik's rock for "fireball" and "firesam" matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure in the U.S. team, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his blows away with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old sportsman, who was never even at the top of his career among the most right-wing players, is not in the best form for the difficult game of Le Golf National, where the long unbalanced terrain usually punishes every wrong hit.
And if the game itself is not quite worrying enough, on Sunday's ninth match, Mikelson will face the precise champion of the British Open French Molinari, who is on the team with the new recruit Tommy Flitoud, and they're trying to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who leave with four points before the 12th single match make a strong start, it may prove that Mikelson's match is absolutely decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his co-worker, although he could hardly say anything much different.
"He has fully understood his role today, has submerged me, hugged me and said he will be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He's confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Glory and has given as much as in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing only in two matches.
I expected it to play more, but that's just how it worked, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be at golf and play, as well as everyone else."
Mikelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for most Rider Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career in "Rader Cup", which has never been close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furick said his presence also brings other benefits to a team that are not measured with numbers.
"He's fun, sarcastic, resourceful, he likes to joke with people and he's a great man for every team," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives much more than that just to play."
Thomas Björn, the Captain of Europe, is aware that the big front may soon be a stop.
Europe's team leader Thomas Bjorn knows from personal experience that the great front, crammed up before the single match since the last day of "Rader Cup", can be easily removed.
The Datchan debuted in the 1997 Valderrama match, when the team with Captain Seve Balisteros led five points in front of the Americans, but precisely in the final right was almost achieved and barely succeeded in winning with 141 1⁄2-131/2.
"You continue to remember that we had a big lead on Valderrama; we also had a big lead on Brookline, where we lost, and Valderrama we won, but very difficult," Bjorn said, after the European team won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, leading with 10-6 on Le Golf National:.
So history has to show both me and everyone in the team that it's not all over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you have to do.
Nothing's finished until you see the final result on the table.
We have a goal and it's to try to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
All the time I've been saying that I think only about the 12 players in our team, but we're also aware of our rivals who are the biggest players in the world."
Satisfying with the performance of the players at a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush with the holidays.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow's pre-planning will come out of individual performances, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's all right, but when you go out alone, then you're testing your entire capacity as a golf player.
This is the message that should reach players: tomorrow you must give the best of your own.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he has to give himself up to the end."
Unlike Byrne, the captain of rival Jim Furick will want his players to appear better individually than partners, such as exceptions are just Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three of four possible points.
Furik himself was from both sides of these great reverses in the last day – he was part of the triumph of Brookline, and then he was from the losing side when Europeans performed the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw on Brookline, as well as on Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under tremendous stress.
That's why we formed our composition and distributed our boys as we wanted to, so that we could try and do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned to lead our counterattack and face Rory McKilroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitoud and Jan Polter will meet other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
"I chose these players in this order because I think it gives us the greatest chance of success," Bjorn said of his election for the singles.
Germany defers the launch of a new warship
The German fleet's latest fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships since the Cold War, but this would not be carried out until at least the following year due to the faulty systems and the hoisting costs reported by local media.
The introduction of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the brand new tracks of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted an army speaker.
The shipyard had to join the military forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the old Bremen ships.
We understand that they will have powerful weapons, a set of air and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some layers of technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest brakes must be able to be used for up to two years before returning to the port of residence.
The continuous delays, however, mean that the avant-garde military ships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will be old when entering operation, Die Zeit notes.
F125 crashed into the headline last year, when the German fleet officially refused to release the fleet into operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of major "software and hardware defects" that make the military ship useless if it is sent to a military mission.
The software deficiencies are particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg fleets will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older Bremen fleets.
In addition, it has been shown that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the military forces to add future surpluses.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the whole project – including equipment training – is also becoming a problem.
It is estimated that the staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) have been achieved – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest brakes are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German military forces are emerging.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, admitted that the fleet is in fact "exploited from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said that the problem had become bigger over time, as the old ships had been operated, but no new ones had been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class fragments could be included in the fleet.
National Trust Follows the Secret Life of Stickys
A new study carried out in accommodation in the Scottish mountains aims to determine how the trailers use the landscape when hunting.
The hopes are that the discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying bats and will help guide future conservation actions.
The study of scientists from Scotland's National Trust will often follow the stickers, as well as the brown eyebrows at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations in the rental to track the activities of trailers during the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the call sounds of stickers, as well as what types they publish.
Then a map of the residence and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Duar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for the adhesives and how they are used in every kind.
This information will help determine the benefits of the work on housing management, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for adhesives and other related species.
The populations of adhesives in Scotland and in the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to the loss of their homes.
The risk to populations may be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, the stickers are not blind.
However, because of their night fishing habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an improved ecolocation technique to tackle insects and obstacles to their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large-scale gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, accepts the trailers very seriously.
The trust has trained experts who carry out regular investigations, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created the first in Scotland and the only special adhesive reserve in Thrave's property in the Dufres and Galway area, which is home to eight of the ten adhesives in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's estate says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a great area for the trailers," he noted.
"We have old buildings, very old trees and completed a suitable residence.
But there's still a lot of things about the beauties that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He stresses that it is important to check the availability of adhesives before carrying out asset maintenance activities, as it is possible to kill up to 400 female and young adhesives, as well as destroy the entire local population.
The trailers are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, freeze, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish servant in the Trust for the Protection of Adhesives, encouraged society to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our beauties and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what’s going on with their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of rape and his lawyers will judge a German magazine.
Christian Ronaldo defined the allegations of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "want to be known", using his name.
His lawyers will trial the German journal Der Spiegel, which publishes these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Yuventus was accused of rape by US Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claims he then paid her $375 000 to calm down the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a video in Instagram, turning to its 142 million followers, a few hours after the publication of the claims 33-year-old Ronaldo sealed the publication as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news," the gold ball carrier told the camera five times.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to build up my back's popularity, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to judge Der Spiegel for the claims that they call "unallowable publication of suspicions in the field of personal life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage in proportion to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident in question occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football room where they claimed that he had raped her on an annal basis, according to the documents filed in the district court of Clark County in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after Ronaldo's incident he fell on his knees and told her that he was a "good boy" of "99 percent", but in the case he simply submitted to "one percent".
According to Ronaldo's papers, he confirmed that they had sex, but that's what happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and was taken photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "feared by revenge" and was concerned that she would not "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement, as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
At the time of Ronaldo's incident, he was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italy's Grand Juventus for a sum of 100m euros.
Brexit: Britain "will regret forever" that it has lost car manufacturers
Britain "will regret forever", if it loses its status as a world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effect of delaying the border in the case of Brexit without a transaction could lead to loss of jobs.
In the factory in Burnaston – where the Auris and Avensis models are produced – nearly 150 000 cars were manufactured last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain left the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fears about leaving the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade would work.
BMW, for example, says they're going to close their mini-model factory in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in Brexit’s cases without a transaction.
Toyota's production line is working on the "precisely time" principle, with the parts arriving at every 37 minutes from suppliers, both from the UK and the EU for cars manufactured by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a transaction on 29 March, there may be problems on the border, which the industry considers could lead to delays and lack of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to wait more than one day to fill their inventory in the Darbisher plant, they said from the company, and that's why the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's "shammat" plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to conclude the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to get this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio's 4's Today program.
"Following the claims not only of Toyota, but also of other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to ensure successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot say how long production will be stopped, but in a longer term they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Chowalaris, who has worked in Burundi for 24 years and is the founder of the United in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “I try to think that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
Government speaker said: "We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The most important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "delayed for another week", as the candidate for the Bret Cavano Supreme Court continues to fight for the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian intervention in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's assistants and the potential obstacle to the judiciary by the President.
This is whether Trump will fire the Deputy Chief Prosecutor, or not that way threatens Mueller's independence, for months he's been feeding the rumors about Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies that claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was in the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him on Thursday.
Trump said he would "be preferring not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal commission, which they testified to both Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blazi Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI of complaints against Cavano, even more delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's spokesman, Sara Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It may be a week, but seeing all the other things happening in the Supreme Court, I think it can be postponed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I've always been trying to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would argue this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The director of the presentation Chris Wallace asked for the reason.
Sanders denied that the rare press conferences were not due to the "demonstration behaviour" of television journalists, although he said, "I cannot say that I disagree with the fact that they have demonstration behaviour."
Then she insisted that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers from each president before him," she said, adding, without quoting the evidence: "We have checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the US President, that is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it often, and you're witnesses to practice it quite often in the last few weeks, and this will replace press conferences once you have the opportunity to talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
The independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President may show why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior before the journalists gathered.
Minister of Health addressed EU workers in Scotland's National Health Service with regard to Brexit-related concerns
The Minister of Health addressed EU staff working in Scotland's National Health Service in writing to express the State's gratitude and desire to remain in their seats after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the remaining less than six months before Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the costs of established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment continued, with decisions expected in this autumn.
But the UK government also makes progress in its preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to remind you how much I appreciate each employee's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Members of the EU as a whole and beyond contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is of benefit to the patients and communities to whom I serve.
Scotland is unconditionally your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christian Abercromby undergoes emergency surgery after receiving a head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers Linebanker, Krischen Abercrombi, undergoes an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury during the Saturday meeting when his team lost Vanderbilt Comodors with 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Senior Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reid, told reporters that the trauma happened just before the half.
"He went to the side line and somehow just fell there," Reid said.
Trainers and medical personnel submitted Abercrombi's oxygen to the side line before it was placed on the conveyor and taken to the additional check-points.
Tennessee State official confirmed in front of Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercromby had left surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details of the nature/seriousness of the trauma", as well as that Tennessee State is trying to understand when the trauma occurred.
Abercromby, a secondary student with a college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving the match, which makes a total of 18 blocks for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher herb tax when purchasing real estate in the UK
According to new plans of conservators, foreign buyers will be charged with a higher levy on the purchase of real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in herb tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The government purse expects an increase of over 120 million British pounds a year, which will help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce the decision of foreign buyers to pay a higher herb tax when purchasing real estate in the UK, as additional revenues will go to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more accessible housing and directed to people with high incomes.
The increase in herb tax will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional revenues helping the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current Gerbov tax, including the higher levels, introduced two years ago for second dwellings and properties purchased for surrender – may amount to up to three percent.
The state stock store expects revenues to increase by up to 120 million British pounds a year.
About 13% of the newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, leading to price increases and making it difficult for people who buy property for the first time to intervene in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become "prison cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time abroad.
The new policy appears only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in herb tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by robbing the land, but not using it, and asked Mrs. May to leave the quotas for affordable housing to repair the "watch with the British housing".
Mr. Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including the control of rentals and the end of the "no wine" expulsions.
He also wants to provide councils with greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I shared that I would like to devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not proper for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, to buy as easy housing as those who work hard in the United Kingdom.
For too many people the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the pollution from sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland's team"
Sanderland Manager Jack Ross said that "the greatest ambition" in his career is to be senior coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish accepted the challenge of re-establishing a club from northeastern England, which is currently in the third position in the First League, at three points from the first place.
He passed to Steidom of Light this summer, after last season brought St. Myron back to the Scottish High League.
"I wanted to play for my family as a player.
I wrote down a B team match, and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up with the Scottish teams of Hampdon, which as a child we watched with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
"This possibility, however, would only be opened if I had success at the club level."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sanderland's managers are names like Dick Advokaat, David Mois, Sam Alardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kein, Gus Poiet and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Atletic's former teacher said he was not concerned as an heir to such established names in such a famous club, as he had previously rejected offers from Barnes and Ipsuic Town.
"For me, success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the High League?"
Because by structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It won't be easy to go back to the highest level of football, but I'll assume that I've achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has been a manager for only three years, after spending some time as an assistant in Dumberton and 15 months in Harts' training staff.
Then he helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St. Myron from a winning team to the Championship during the next season.
Ross said he now feels more comfortable than he did during his career as a footballer in Clyde, Hartlipoul, Folkrick, St. Myron and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really on the cross," he remembers when he took Aloa.
"I really believed that being a manager is the best way forward for me, including before being an active player.
It sounds strange because I did well, I made good money, and I had some significant success.
But sometimes it's hard to be a player.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still faced with the same levels of stress and stress at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I've really done it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin my whole life."

The perfect time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, discovers research
The summer heat increases the income of the struggling British pubs to survive, but increases tension for the restaurants.
Groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the business-consultant CGA, who composed the statistics, said: “It has been longer and longer since England’s expected participation in the World Cup, in July, it follows a similar model as in June when the pubs grew by 2.8%, but the restaurants received a stronger impact.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and drinks bars reported the best results in their growth compared to the lower movement of the restaurants.
Food bubbles have also suffered from the sun, but not as much as the owners of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In the pubs and bars the sales of drinks jumped by 6.6 per cent per month, while in the food there was a 3 per cent decrease."
Paul Newman, from the rest and entertainment analysts of RSM, said: “These results continue the trend that we observed at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the services sector outside the home.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to suffer, although the decrease in sales by 4.8 per cent on an annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to the constant costs.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for food managers, and only time would show if the moderate temperatures we experienced in August would bring the desired rest."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the spread of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales analyst in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data for the implementation of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion British pounds, and is a strong indicator in the industry.
One of five children hides their parents' secret profile in a social network
One of five children – some barely 11 – has a secret profile in a social network that hides from their parents and teachers, revealed a study
Study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows the growth of false Insta pages
The news raised fears that sexual content should be published
Twenty percent of students said they have a "basic" profile that shows their parents
One of the five children – some of the 11 – creates a social network profile that keeps adults secret.
A study of 20,000 high school students shows growth in false Insta accounts – a transfer to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news raised fears that sexual content should be published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean "basic" profile that they show their parents, while at the same time have secret profiles.
The mother, who came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, discovered a teenager who encouraged others to "violate him".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) at independent schools found that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, with half of them acknowledging that they keep their profiles secret.
HMC's manager, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's very important that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in Board of Light Athletics in Scotland
Elid Doyle was chosen to join the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland as director without executive functions of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete and President Ian Bijit has set this move as a great opportunity for those who are leading sports to take advantage of her rich international experience in the past decade.
"Eilide is delighted to be highly respected in the light-years of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that light-year athletics in Scotland will bring great benefits with her attraction," Biite said.
Doyle said: "I wish to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the finals of the 200 and 400 metres Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, adding to his total four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator at BBC, lost his ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic approach.
He wrote on Twitter: “I got hit a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show me if I were to recover to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I achieved a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing movement training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages."
Advertising for cream pump that compares mothers to cows, share online opinions
The company producing cream pumps splits online opinions with advertising that compares nursing mothers with cows that feed.
To mark the launch of the expected "first forest-free cream pump in the world suitable for wear", the consumer technology company Elvie released the cool music-video ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to the worms to show off.
Four true mothers dance in a cow's band, full of hay, on the background of a song with text including: "Yes, I come, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, that's not what we see, these are my breasts".
The poem continues: “Expect, pump, feed the babies with them, pump, pump, touch your friends. ”
The advertisement, however, published on the company's Facebook page, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the clip received mixed reactions from the viewers, as many say it reduces the "fears" of the dairy processing industry.
"It is a very foolish decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The feeding pump Elvie collects discreetly in the feedingstuff (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another said, "So inadequate advertising."
Others defended the ad, as one woman admitted that she considered the song "extremely fun".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy one of those if I was still breast-feeding.
Discharge made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a bit of a rat, but I accept it as it is.
This product is brilliant," somebody wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny advertising directed to mothers who give up (often at their jobs or in toilets) and feel like "bloods".
It is not an advertising, praising or condemning the dairy processing industry."
At the end of the clip, the group of women discovers that they danced with the discreet pumps placed in their bodies.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who feed feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely soundless, no wires or tubes and it gathers discreetly in the back of the stomach, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they're out.
Anna Balarin, partner and CEO of Mother, comments: “The Elvie campaign is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch on the market.
With the drawing of a parallel between the beet and the milk cows, we wanted to focus on the cutting of the beet and all the challenges associated with it, while at the same time showing more fun and understanding the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump falls into the leading news.
During the Fashion Week in London, a mother of two children appeared at a stage for designer Marta Jacobovski, using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants have been secretly moved to a palace camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants jumped sharply, although the monthly crossings of the border remain relatively unchanged, in part because sharp rhetoric and politics by the Trump administration made it difficult for children to live with supporters.
Usually most of the applicants are immigrants without documents that are afraid of risking their stay in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults of the family should provide fingerprints, as these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albens, a senior servant in the Immigration and Customs Service, testified to the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who wanted to become advocates of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Approximately 80 per cent of the persons who are either accused or members of the family of the accused are illegally resident in the country, as most of them are foreigners.
So we'll keep chasing these people," Albens said.
In order to cope with the registration of these children more quickly, the authorities imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear before a court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous rule, according to officials in the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference, not personally, to present their case for legal status before an immigration court.
Those who are defined as unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which may lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to officials in receptions and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers have said that this concern has grown in large facilities, such as those in Tornilo, where the signs that some child has problems are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the place.
They added that moving the children to the "palatsk town" without giving them enough time to prepare at an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends can make the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally staying in Syria under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "they will take the appropriate action".
"They must be removed immediately and without any conditions," he said to the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "war on terror is almost to its end" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forced out of their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian countries are cleansed" as well as "every illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian members, opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the countries that have been devastated by the war.
As for the Mualem refugees, he said that the conditions are favourable and can be returned, accusing "some Western countries that "feel unwarranted fears", which encourage refugees to stand aside.
"We have encouraged the international community and humanitarian organizations to cooperate on these returns," he said.
"They are turning something into a political issue, which is a completely humanitarian issue."
The US and the European Union warned that aid would not be provided for the recovery of Syria until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to stop the war was reached.
The UN diplomats said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last great fortress of the rebels in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a widespread attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
At the same time, he stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed towards the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaida front, who would "be destroyed".
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee, composed of government members and opposition, to form a draft of the Syrian constitution and to conduct the elections.
Mulem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to the "view of members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win second term
On this logic, Trump will win the election again in 2020, unless – as many liberals are likely to hope – his presidency will not be cut short because of the impiecment and scandal.
That would certainly be "the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
At the moment, there's no sign of the audience's fatigue.
From 2014 onwards, the premium rate has increased by double to CNN 1.05 million and nearly three times to MSNBC 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the premium, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC is at the top of a cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at dinners with big news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Bayer, an executive producer of the ABC's "Last Candidate" drama, where it refers to a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on Capital.
Nell Skovall, a veteran screenwriter and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club”, has another theory.
She remembers driving in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, "Why?"
Mrs. Scowley told me that he said, "Because he's laughing at me."
There's a party in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that is shown on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of "Rou v. Wade", whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
However, the desire to be informed by a citizen does not correspond to this in six hours to watch a group of experts discuss Bob Udurd, who uses "deep historical information" as a source of his book "Strah"; Paul Manafort's pilot's coat of leather for $15,000 ('drift full of arrogance' according to Washington Post'), and the striking descriptions of Stormi Daniels about Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"The honor of what he does to make you feel like part of the reality show is to give you a little every night," said Brant Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, regarding the changing participants and the day-to-day approach (agreement with the National Football League, praise of Kim Chen Un).
You can't let yourself miss an episode because you're gonna stay.
When I contacted Mr. Flash this week, he was on the northern coast of Kauai sun, 80 degrees, but he was closed home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not be separated from the TV, especially when Brett Cavano had to stand before the Senate's legal commission, and that depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to do all those stupid lectures and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flash told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Investments are involved in the most controversial competition in the early elections for a place in Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money thanks to the redeployment of Congress districts and from there two titulars for the same place.
The newly redeployed district in Pittsberg's suburb points to conservative democracy Connor Lamb, which won its place from another district of partial elections last spring.
Lamb faces another titular, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly represented by the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordered in January that the old districts were anti-constitutionally manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the party's main financing institutions, the Democratic Congress Commission on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb went to Pennsylvania after the difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th convention district of Pennsylvania.
The position was taken by the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county with 20 points.
Political experts believe that democracies have a slight advantage.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, after which it withdrew
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to respond to the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to "the quick decisions no longer to be recognized by Taiwan", said earlier this month Heather Naurt, spokesperson of the Department.
But sanctions were only provided against El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately $140 million from America for the fight against drugs, for development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be punishable by the State of Central America with its unemployment and percentage of murders.
In advance of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which serves to continue such a gathering last year, considered as a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior management authorities clarified their desire to hold the conference, thus effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens now announced that he would participate in the conference scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the gathering, the diplomats say.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The spokesperson of the White House for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, wanted to remain anonymous who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Study History
The next move may be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible impediment of Mr Trump's justice, as the report is at present a significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Mueller is directing his investigation and whether Mr. Trump has been in charge of Russia during his campaign in their attack on our elections.
If Congress's leadership changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to report to this body, exactly when he is prepared to face voters, and perhaps even to court-martials made up of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I am not impressed that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – and that of similar ones in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make these choices that will affect how long the struggle will take.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, until the West had given him a stand and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the following years of the clan.
The course of history depends on such captures, and the improbable march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing a few similar captures.
What if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to secretly write down the president and speculated that it was not appropriate for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein said the history of Times was incorrect.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavano, demanded by the FBI, is not complete or fair - or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite the allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And most of all, will we vote in the early elections for Congress if that forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe we're not going to fail because I've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was driven to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn the candles for Shabat on that table, wearing a satchel.
With inheritance like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Icen, senior member of the Brookings Institute, is president of "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington", and is author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Gram Dorans from Rangers is an optimist for a rapid-wienna collision.
Rangers are home to Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to continue ahead of Group G of the League of Europe.
Contusion in the knee did not allow semi-defencer Graham Dorans to play his first match for the season before the 2-2 equality with Villareal concerned, but he believes that for Rangers this result could become a trampline to greater achievements.
"We won an important point because Vilareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old footballer said.
"We entered the match with hope that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but all equality seems fair.
They were better during the first half, and we were better during the second half.
We've taken a look at Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope we can fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they have achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I'm sure with the support of our audience we can give everything from ourselves and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely hard after everything that happened along my contusions and changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone in the way.
The team's good, and the guys are really having fun, training's useful.
I hope that we will be able to exert all the forces to forget the past season and achieve the desired success."
Women are worried about fears about their pensions
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what concerns they would like to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study share that they discussed with their husbands the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent talked to their children about this.
"The family wants to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the sector for the life insurance business of Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not predetermine your wishes.
Together with your advisor and your family discuss where and how you want to get care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining the costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you with the idea of how to pay these expenses.
Your decisions, when you choose a long-term financial institution, may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with a monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles early.
appoint a health care officer so that you have a certain trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial officer.
You can choose a trusted person who will make the financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your parent needs urgent medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions about medicines and allergies?
Show these details in a written form to be prepared.
"It's not just about the financial aspect, it's also about what doctors are going to be," Martin asks.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan."

A man was shot several times with an air rifle while he was going home tonight.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police describe the shooting that took place around 02:30 a.m. in British summer time, as a "accident act".
The injured man couldn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a powerful earthquake and tsunamis that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced, expecting the number of dead to rise.
Due to the interrupted communications, support organisations cannot obtain information from the Dongala Regency, a region north of Palu, which is located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulavesi, located at the end of the narrow beach edge of the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with a population of 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunamis hit it.
Dongala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the island of Sulavesi.
The Regency, which is less administrative region than the Province, is a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of the province of central Sulavesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The acquisition of nickel is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian post-disaster recovery agency.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Cunami took over the western part of Dongala, and in 1996, when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Tichocean Fire Ring" and is regularly covered by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and waves of tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong truce on the 26th December of the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra triggers a wave of tsunamis that has hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias on the shores of Sumatra.
2006: Trus with a magnet of 6,8 is the largest island in Indonesia, Yava, triggering tsunamis, which breaks down on the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Earthquake 7.6 hits near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake with a magnet 7.5 killed one of Mentawa Island and activated a 10-metre wave of tsunamis that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidi Jaya's regency hit the flat earthquake in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people mentioned the desolations of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, no tsunamis are activated, but more than 100 people were killed by broken buildings.
2018: Strong rabbits killed the tourist island Lombok in Indonesia, more than 500 people died, most of them from the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists homeless.
Sara Palin's biggest son is arrested for domestic violence charges
Trak Pailin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and a candidate for Vice President Sara Pailin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Pailin, 29-year-old, from Wasil, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, involvement in domestic violence reports and resistance to arrest, according to a report by the state police in Alaska, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Pailin is detained in the Mat-Su pre-retention building and under an unsecured guarantee of $500, reports KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he was declared "innocent, certainly", when he was asked to plead, the media reported.
Pailin is threatened with three Class A violations, which means he can be deprived of liberty for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of a Class B offence, which is punishable by a day in prison and fine of $2000.
This is not the first time that Pileen has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Pailin.
His mother, Sarah Pailin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being examined by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in reporting a domestic violence crime and possession of weapons under the influence of substances in relation to the incident.
His friend claims he hit her with a fist on her face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by groups of veterans in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress arising from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died of an earthquake that devastated the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Earthquake of 7.5 caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication network is broken, expecting the number of dead to grow in the near days.
The earthquake hit close to central Sulavezi, north-east of the capital of Indonesia – Jakarta.
Social networks turn around videos that show the moment of the crash.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palo when the wave tsunamis hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death penalty for suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors from New York want a death penalty for Saifolo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died – a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It is claimed that Saipov, 30 years old, used a truck to hire Home Depot to carry out the assassination in October of the bike near the West Side highway in the Manhattan Valley, gasping pedestrians and bikers on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov 's intentional' has killed eight victims and 'intention' has caused serious bodily damage, according to the notification of intent in connection with the request for a death penalty lodged in the South region of New York.
According to the court document, both charges can end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an expanded federal judiciary sent Saipov a 22-point indictment, including eight crimes related to the murder of a racket used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and the destruction of the IPS.
The attack required "serious planning and intention," prosecutors said, describing how Saipov was executed as "worn, cruel and disgusting".
"Syfolo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, harm and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lori Decad, Daran Drake, Ariel Erly, Ernan Felci and Alejandro Damian Panuko," the notification says.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last South of New York looking for a death penalty.
The accused, Halid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug addicts, but was subsequently sentenced to life sentence in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed on a federal case in New York was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conspiracy sentence and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed on the electric table on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek nationalist, showed no remorse during the days and months after the assassination, according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of his phone IDIL, claimed the indictment.
He also asked in his hospital room to place the IDIL flag, they told the police.
He pleads innocent on the indictment of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were "evidently disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence instead of a sentence of guilt and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all affected," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously wanted the prosecutor's office not to want a death sentence.
Member of Parliament of the Conservatives says NAYJUL FARAZ must lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz pledged to "mobilize the army of the people" today, during a protest at the conservative conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should "taste pressure" – as one of the members of Teresa May's own party, he proposed to run negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a conservative member, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would have gone out so far", if Mr. Faraz was secretary of Brexit's issues.
But the challenge that Mrs May faced to agree with the party's deep-separated lines was underlined by conservatives who supported the remaining members who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to preserve his compromise "Checkers", despite the attacks by the supporting Brexit, the remaining EU.
The Allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite the hostile reactions and insist that the Eurosceptics and liberators choose between its package and "chao".
Mr. Bon said to the protesters with the slogan "Outing means getting out" in Saul, that he wanted to "reject Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr Faraz had to share with the others and that he had to receive responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If it was the beginning, we would have left," he said.
The Commissioner of Welingboro added: "I support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan.
Referring to his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be rude.
We want to create our laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the claim that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The understanding that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain is completely wrong".
Conservatives' representative Andrea Jenkins also participates in the rally, sharing with reporters: “I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out the street and really helped us be elected.
Please drop the "Checkers" and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs. May, she added: “The pioneers keep their position when they keep their promises.”
Mr Faraz said at the meeting that politicians should be "pressed" if they intend to change the decision, taken after the referendum in 2016.
"Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change Brexit and we're meeting here today to say, "We won't let this happen to you."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the edge of changing Brexit, feel pressure.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country, which helped us win at Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supporting remains passed through Birmingham before they held a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
The ranks of activists were raised by flags with "Conservators against Brexit", after the group started this weekend.
Laberist Lord Adonis competed with the conservatives on the security issues of the party's application when it was found at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all of Canada's technology and yet, for the smooth crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren said he'd "think seriously" his bid for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that he would "consider seriously the opportunity to apply for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the representative of the Massachusetts Democrats spoke of his future during a city council in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a constant critic of President Donald Trump, will apply for re-election in November against the state's representative of the Republics of Jeff Dale, who was the joint chairman of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the centre of speculation that it can take the post of Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holiouk was her 36th meeting with voters in the village building after Trump entered duty.
One of the present asked her if she was planning to apply for the president.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington and repair our damaged government, and that includes women at the top.
He was arrested for the death of Sims by LSU.
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that he had a suspect arrested at the shooting on Friday when the basketballist Wade Sims was killed by the LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, a 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11:00 east time.
They posted a video from the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify the man that is seen on the footage.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"The Wade Sims was shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade got involved to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted he was at the crime scene, he had a gun, and he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was safely arrested and detained in the arrest of the police department of the Eastern Baton Rouge.
A young man who grew up 6′6′′, grew up in Baton Rose – Sims participated in 32 matches with 10 matches as a titular last season and recorded on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Gran Pri of Russia: Luis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after the team's instructions helped him win Sebastian Fetel
Ever since Walter Botas was ranked ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds, allowing Fetel to attack his associate.
Fetel first made a pi-stop and let Hamilton deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial for the outcome of the race.
Mercedes also made a pi-stop on the next round and came out after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to beat him after a rough maneuver and drive "gum to rubber", which forced the Ferrari pilot to untie the inner part of the track to avoid punishment for a while after he had already closed his opponent's path with a dangerous double protection maneuver on the third turn.
On top of his 21st birthday Max Verstapen started from the back lines of the start grid and was seventh after the end of the first round.
Then he even ran a long time since he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly to beat Kimy Rayconen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered the pit stop in the 44th round, but failed to grow enough in the next eight rounds and finally Raymond finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Walter did a great job all weekend and turned out to be a real gentleman when he let me beat him.
The team has done an outstanding job to win the first two places on the podium," Hamilton said.
That was really a bad language of the body.
President Donald Trump competed with Senator Diane Finnstein on Saturday for her claim that she had not circulated the letter from Christine Blazi Ford, who accused the applicant of Supreme Court Bret Cavano of sexual harassment.
During the discussion of the war in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the demonstrations given by Ford before the Senate's legal commission, and instead commented on how the Senate shows that people are "bad and disgusting and dishonest".
"What can happen also is the beauty that happens in the last few days in the Senate when you see anger when you see angry people and evil, disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at the publications and distribution, and they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you know?
Diane Finnstein, has she spread out of you?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we didn't spread," he added, imitating the senator.
Finn sent the letter with details about Ford's claims against Cavano in July, and it was spread earlier in September – but Finnhein denied that this distribution had happened from her office.
"I haven't covered Ford's claims, I haven't spread her story," Finnstein told the commission, The Hill.
"She asked me to keep confidentiality and I kept confidentiality as she wished."
But her rejection was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday evening: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to protect the Supreme Court's applicant charged with sexual crimes against three women, the president stated that the Democrats used claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to restore their power with all possible means.
Look at dishonesty, shamelessness, they don't care who they're gonna hurt, who they have to run, to regain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundi Schar 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dandy.
Dandy Schar returned for Friday's loss in Elite League against Belfast Giants, winning a five-three-year-old award in Dundy on Saturday.
The Giants led an early two-ball match after Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovilleer hit.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kauney took over the housekeepers before Dwyer restored Giants' front.
Francoa Bushar is equal to Dundi before the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen to confirm their victory.
This is the third victory in Elit League for Adam Kiff's boys who got out of the bottom to win Dundy in Belfast on 2-1 Friday night.
That was the fourth match between the opponents of this season, when Giants won the previous three matches.
The blow that Duyer discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendall McFoul's assistance, and then David Rutherford doubles his advance, assisting Bovilier four minutes later.
It was a tense beginning, Sullivan returned the hosts back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped to equalize with the help of Kauni at 15:16.
Duyer's trying to take the Giants before the first break, marking the second goal for the night at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar rebalanced the odds with a powerful blow at the door at 27:37.
Couni and Charles Corcoran united their efforts to help Nilsen give priority to Dundi for the first time at the end of the second half, giving everything from himself and confirming the victory of the team with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
Giants, who lost the last four matches of total five, meet as hostess Milton Kins for their next match on Friday.
The pilot of the plane died to ensure that hundreds of people aboard the plane can escape from an earthquake
The pilot of flights in Indonesia is praised as a hero, after his death, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board has managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people died and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulavezi on Friday, triggering wave tsunamis.
The strong secondary rabbits continued to defeat the area, and many were caught in a trap from the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the heavily shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, would manage to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided to crash.
He died at the hospital later.
Air Control spokesperson, Indonesia, Johannes Sirat, said that this decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the disaster response agency in the country has announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase, as many bodies are still under the fractures, and many people cannot reach," said the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached six meters, devastated Palu, where there is a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the nurse brings more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
There's marches everywhere in the miniartics."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, pointed out to CNN: “The red cross in Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and turned to the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?", CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was devastated by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reported that a person is unconscious after an aircraft crash in the lagoon
The aircraft that flew with a plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon now reports that a person has been declared missing after earlier stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the sinking aircraft.
In the press release Air Niugini stated that from Saturday afternoon they cannot contact a male passenger.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find a man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Ships of local people helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuk Airport.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The reason for the disaster and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airlines and the U.S. military forces said the plane had landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane was over the track.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims that the plane was very low.
"That's very nice," says Janes.
Janes tells us that he and the others managed to cross through the deep to cross the water to reach the crash exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the stewards had panicked and screamed, as well as that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. military forces tell us that sailors repairing nearby port have also helped in the rescue operation, using an uplifting boat to get people to the shore before the plane falls into the depths of about 30 metres of water (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in flights registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyst exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The Public Prosecutor's Office concluded its presentation on a case-by-case Saturday in the retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulet of the US Ministry of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to collect the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette said he got data on the location of several mobile phones showing that Teleis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to ask Sanford.
Sanferd stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck the same night, Sanford said that "it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
The cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Roulette pointed out that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, he deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The protection is planned to begin with its concluding findings on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be presented to the judges later that day.

Another black guy?
A New Yorker judges a couple after being fired for a "racist" message
A New York bartender judges a couple for dismissal because of discrimination after receiving a missent message from the mother who complains that she is "the other black woman".
The two deny that they are racist, conforming to the demand for "extension".
Linzi Plasco-Flixman, the mother of two children, was stoned when she learned that the new baby girl, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEE, THE SECRETARY-GENERAL," wrote in a text message to her husband, Ms. Plasko-Flackman.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flacksman felt that she had fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the former bartender, who was an African-American, did not do well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for one working day after she was sent home with a taxi.
Now Morris judges the couple for compensation for the dismissal, wanting the $350 a day for the six-month contract for which she was originally hired, although she did not have a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't have to do that," she told Post on Friday, adding, "You're sure this is discrimination."
In response, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that the termination of Morris’s employment was a reasonable act, as they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they tried her.
“My wife sent something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you tried, even if it was wrong?
You're a newborn?
Think about it."
In imitation of the demand for "extension", Plasko claims that his wife was born only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to attack someone in this state?
It's not particularly nice," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still under review, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in social networks, denying them their conduct and logic.
Padington's publishers were afraid that readers wouldn't feel connected to a talking bear, revealing a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yangkel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, relates the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It's very fun now that we're aware of the great success of Paddyton."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for BBC, before he was inspired to write the little game book, would feel optimistic about any rejection of the book, adding that he met the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings", after his death last year.
With regard to Padington, whom she describes as "an important member of our family", she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a pretty humble man and was not self-glorious," she said.
"But since you felt that Paddington was so real, it's like having a child that's achieved something: you're proud of him, though it's not your job.
I think you've been taking a little bit of a paddy's success this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits of his own Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter was released, she was rushed to the hospital, Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors struggled to save her life.
"Now he kept ringing to say that the situation was really bad that he didn't expect to survive," said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to say that he would die in two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications provided by her doctors to keep her heart, slowly stop operating and leave her system.
She's been gone a while before, and that's how it's done.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should've done it."
Finally, Mrs Onedan-Laperuz, who has so far been grieving for the loss of her daughter, is on board the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the trial she's going through.
"No one understood," she said.
"I had my head lifted and my tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this overwhelming feeling of complacency with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Grieving women set up cards to prevent suicides from bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones for suicide try to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey put on a bridge in Wells with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years of age from Lidney, says that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him after the smile.
They've always said that his smile is shining every room."
However, he gave up his job before he left, and was in "a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that this will have some consequences."
Ms. Davis created the cards, “so people can know who to go to and who to talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Do not keep silence – you must speak."
Mrs. Humphrey, a long-term friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her 15-year-old companion, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he felt depressed or depressed, or anything else," she said.
"A few days ago, we noticed a change in his state.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their gifts, he looked neither at them nor at anything."
She said that it was a terrible trauma to them, but they had to deal with it: “It opens a gap in the family.
He's breaking us up.
But we have to move forward and fight."

Brett Cavano's future is under discussion after the FBI starts investigating
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted – research with limited length and limited scope – perhaps we could unite our efforts," Mr. Flake said Saturday and added that he was afraid that the Commission would "distort" despite the confirmed suprapartie blocking.
Why didn't Mr. Kawano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct a investigation?
Their desire is for the moment itself.
Early elections are only after five weeks, on 6 November – if the Republicans are not well represented, they will seriously suffer their attempts to be elected to their highest court in the state.
George W. Bush called senators, urging them to support Mr. Cavano, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pens to announce equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea "decreases" in Kim
South Korean legislator claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came into power seven years ago.
Park Beeong Sug, quoting data from the South Korean Union Ministry, said last year there were 1127 refugees, as compared to 2011 they were 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts required by human smugglers, are the key factors.
There's no official comment from Phanyan.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually receive citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and passes easier than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), which divides the two corners.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, as often forced returnees.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Phanyan for talks focused on standing in the nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work in general for the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho accused the US of the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the US, we will not be sure of our national security and under these circumstances there is no way to disfellowship ourselves for the first time," Mr. Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cavano "esteric" and said it's not suitable for service in the Supreme Court
The minority leader at Congress Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Cavano "esteric" and said he was too unbalanced for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi comments this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"There was no way to think that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would call her "esteretic," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kawano's testimony to the Senate's legal commission on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected the claim that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blazi Ford when both were teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavano was very emotional, at times he almost cried and felt when discussing his family and his academic years.
He also categorically condemned the democracies in the commission, calling claims against him "a greek and coordinated attack on the personality", organized by liberals who are not satisfied that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi pointed out that according to her testimony to Cavano, he was unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it became clear that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he himself has been disqualified by these claims and by the way in which the Clinton family and the Democrats are persecuted," she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if he would try to discredit Kawano if he was appointed and in case the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say so – if he does not tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only unaware of entering the Supreme Court, but also of the court in which he is now,” Pelosi said.
Now Kavano is a judge in the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that in her capacity as a democracy she was concerned about the potential decisions of Cavano regarding the Act on Accessible Health Care or the case "Rou v. Wade", as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kawano was avoiding questions about whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for an honest, convinced man to enter the court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it great,' said Pelosi.
And women must be in control.
This is a fundamental criticism, after months and years of exploding anger, and she can't accept it without crying.
"I cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinham told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I got a huge help from a woman who was executive director somewhere who said she was crying when she was angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to whom when she was angry and crying, she told her counselor, "You can think I'm sad because she's crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just keeps going.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are allowed in the expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstood at first.
One of the clearest memories of my previous work, in the office primarily with men, is how once, while I was slid out of unexplained anger, a woman older than me caught me by the door – an ominous guide, from which I was always a little scared – and she dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have done it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his campaign as president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship with the yacht called "Monkey Business", he withdrew from the competition, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why he should not consider applying for the president himself.
"It wasn't a well-thought solution," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the competition and the last thing they wanted to happen was to show up another one.
Someone called the situation Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Since it's late in the campaign, it stays with the fundraising and decides it won't stay in the race if it fails to collect $2 million.
The battle is predestined to fail.
She understands that some of her supporters who give $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During his speech, in which he states that he will not continue with an official campaign, she is the hall of so many feelings – thanks to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system, which makes it so difficult to collect money and you can turn to voters, not delegates, and anger against sexism that she felt.
"A man may think I've got a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder how the media reacted.
"Someone can think that Kleinex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my record?
"She's crying?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Serve Beijing
The first fires in the trade war between the US and China were overwhelming and, while the battle is rising rapidly, a gap between the two countries will benefit Beijing in a long-term way, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, shot the first warning bell this year, betting with taxes key elements of Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation of the tension occurred this week with the new customs duties affecting production of 200 billion US dollars (150 billion British pounds) with effective tax on half of all goods imported into the USA from China.
Every time Beijing returned with a new fee of five to ten per cent of US goods for $60 billion.
China has pledged to give back every hit to the United States and soon the second largest global economy is not expected to ignore this.
To get Washington to give up means to submit to the demands, but to keep his head public in front of Washington would be too ashamed of Si Dzinpin, the president of China.
And yet, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure from the US trade war can help China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that an accelerated political decision, both in Washington and Beijing, can create conditions for an economic crisis in some of the two countries, is in fact more dangerous than the observers had previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a scientist on issues related to Asia to the Expert Group Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, Foreign Minister said
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and requests for assistance in restoring the country, devastated by the war, has continued for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress we have in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastated by terrorists to restore them to their normal state.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily and feeding.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any aid in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from the states that financed the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe wins the Rider Cup in Paris
The European team won the "Rader Cup" for 2018, winning the US team with a final score of 16.5 out of 10.5 of the "Le Golf National" on the coast of Paris, France.
Thus, the US has six other losses on European land and has not won the "Rader Cup" in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the champion crown to the tournament after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Björn reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Michelson, who presented himself weakly during most of the tournament, sent his first hit on the 16th hole (with "pair") in the water with which he lost his sword against the French Moliniari.
The Italian golfer Molinari presented itself perfectly in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reached the balance 5-0-0 since the competition took place in the current format after 1979.
American Jordan Spite has categorically lost 5&4 of a player in the European team, located at the lowest place in the ranking – Torbørn Olesen of Denmark.
The world ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 of Ian Paulter from England, for which this is probably the last part of the Raider Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participation in the "Rader Cup", became a European with the most winning points in the tournament at all times, increasing its assets to 25.5 points this year.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t hold back today.
It was a tough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can lift the bath again.
Above all, the team is the most important, and I am happy that I was able to help," the excited Garcia said after the victory of Europe.
He broadcasts his cousin John Ram's staff, who beat US legend Tiger Woods with 2+1 singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud that I won Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching him play," 23-year-old Ram said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and his overall balance of "Rader Cup" is now 13-21-3.
Foreign statistics for one of the biggest players of all time, won 14 great titles – an indicator that only retreats to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team was having trouble all weekend, except Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf all day from the tournament.
The U.S. team leader Jim Furick said after the disappointing performance of the team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we pressed a team in Europe.
There was a battle.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players seemed very good.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the U.S. Association of Professional Golfers and our Committee on "Rader Cup" and will only look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can keep your opponent's hat down.
We just got high."
New for Red Flood: Concentrations decrease in Pinelas, Manuti and Sarasota
The latest report of the Committee on Fish and Wild Animals in Florida shows a fundamental reduction in the concentrations of red inlets in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Committee, there are reports of conditions for growth decline in the areas of Pinelas, Manuti, Sarasota, Charlotte and Kolier districts – this shows a decrease in concentrations.
Water compartments with an excessive colouring of the red tide extend to approximately 130 miles on the coast, from the north of Pinelas to the south of Lee.
Waterfield participants can see 10 miles from the coast of Hillsboro, but they're less than last week.
Red tides are also observed in Pasco County.
Over the past week, there has been evidence of moderate concentrations in the coastal zone or slightly less than in the Pinelas district, low to high concentrations on the coast of the district of Hillsboro, high concentrations in the district of Manuti, high concentrations on the coast or less in the district of Sarasota, moderate concentrations in the district of Charlotte, high concentrations on the coast or less in the district of Lee, and low concentrations in the district of Kolier.
Information on the inflammation of the respiratory tract in the districts of Pinelas, Manuti, Sarasota, Lee and Kolier continues.
There have been no reports of inflammation of the respiratory tract in Northwestern Florida in the past week.
