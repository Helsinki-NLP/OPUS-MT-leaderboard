The remains of UKIP that refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says that NHS should not be used to pay for those coming to the United Kingdom to make health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him whether people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First, you use special arguments, and then you discredit them with an empty homophobia.
Every time I and my family need NHS, we have to make the tail behind the chronic hypocondria intolerants who think they're all due.
I think you're the one who's using specific arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wings, does not exist virtually.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote drawn from a torch does not constitute evidence.
Yes, so pull the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only made a comment.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot to have spread such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with homophobia charges.
Farage's phrase is very surprising, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He didn't make any homophobic remarks at all.
You're gonna have to be able to give it up.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I don't think you like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
It is so rare because unlike Farage and his single disciples of Thatcher who think AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something of good, then no.
Finally, the situation is as bad as in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis in the austerity period, nothing will be done.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a great pleasure.
Ireland is the 'TIGRE OF EUROPE' we were hungry, a few years ago.
We've met the suite!
That begins reading the article.
Ireland is being tried to believe that it is a true country and that a 'New MIRACLE ECONOMIC' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, taxed on the lowest companies in Europe, a three-fold shift of work, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients not of what '' pavoiser'' is for the time being with the coming of the Polish.
In the 1980s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal Considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development has not been a long calm river, it is in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rates in Europe?
It's fake!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on enterprises.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If a report is believed to come out in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France as a whole.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has returned enormously, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I've been living in Dublin for 14 years, the resumption is obvious in everyday noises since the return.
Is it supposed to be economical?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon get hot.
In another article that they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in an accommodation on the A140.
Does Ryanair now have to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of appliances, so a few boxes and scratches on the old ones will be quickly forgotten.
That says I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once-refistolated.
So that would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair make an extra payment to passengers for the additional fear that we wanted to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't let yourself go on vacation, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give it to the heart of joy.
Whatever the article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay other than the basic tariff have to take it on their own, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs resulting from this incident.
I wonder what the delay will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an air traffic controller error.
Passengers have been on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your reparation dreams.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, Frances-Bourgeois Street: the Marais is mostly pedestrian, and literally grows from the world.
People do not come in bulk for the quality of the restaurants (anytime, for most) or for the Salon de la revue à l'Experience des Blancs-Menteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly alive and animated.
With a lot of foreigners who spend..
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, with 50% of tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that seemed acceptable to me is that of areas receiving an important number of foreign tourists and it is drowned by the fact that they buy at a discount.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of business figures each year for the same reasons .
The industry remains where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, allows prices to be reduced.
The Sunday rest is a right to the employees, except for the exceptions.
That is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister in charge of the economy nor the Minister in charge of foreign affairs have the least competence to reform the labour code.
While they're beating it.
What's the law for?
Satisfying a part of the population and businesses that want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my City of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture ...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he has defended with tenacity against fascism

What if the inheritance of his daughter was, contrary to his will, to use to pay the inheritance fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
No doubt his legacy would want his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Not anymore.
But for 5 years, and for only five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he took the lead in other government aristos who wanted to discuss a "agreement" with the Nazis and he won very well.
Thanks to its magnificent rhetoric and its energy, it united the country in the idea that fighting fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world can thank God for having had these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
Churchill's size has nothing to do with this discussion.
If his descendants sold their paintings on the free market to collect the money of inheritance costs, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they collect the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was "the time of truth", Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A resumption of the internal market by public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, infrastructure buildings being by little renewable by definition.
With regard to the social reforms recommended by the Minister, they well reflect the real misconception of the dialogue:
Return to the values of princes.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the lowest of us not be in need!
It is in solidarity that we come to his aid, or he has the right to exchange the services he provides or has made to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smile corresponds to this vision.
There is also the dancer who lives on income from his property.
There is a difference between the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives from his pension.
One to rent or two for a couple up there, it's vice
Finance's little genius is a lack of imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of shortage in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, that is not the case.
The developed countries are overequipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so in nothing a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the issue of decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a wild decline, therefore brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less difficult, then the need for investment is creating: isolation, rail network renewal, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc.
A tax that promotes high income and income.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopin.
Samsung's benefits are abused by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range.
The introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have purchased a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and I decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's sake.
I think it's essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft introduced this philosophy, we met a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by one manufacturer because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach any value to the design, for them the options, functionality and the prize.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform".
Is there a "better car builder", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing portable industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's cleaner and must be encouraged.
That's what's in our interest to all of us.
I'm glad you found exactly what you're looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our Umpfrontists friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, well on Parisian bobos) could tell us which author(s) they fight ideas about the genre and tell us what works they just want to fight.
Or are they just attacking the kind as described in Le Figaro, Minutes or Current Values?
Is it Judith Butler or Eric Zemmmour?
Well, Jean, I love you very much, and you're someone of intelligence and cultivation.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato, calling Holoferne, which had not come to me (I did not have his spirit life).
Otherwise, in the background, since you're referring to it, I don't care, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I hope you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I'm slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: Recognize that, culturally, refer Judith to Holoferen, that's what it is.
Who's afraid of asking the world?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ give us the answers.
The first by calling on the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler of a very symbolic gorilla.
We can see how close these studies are to their home.
We are obviously no longer in the debate.
It's another thing, much deeper.
@ Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: As for an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Pretend to fight ideas from the only exhibition that their detractors do ( Cardinal Ratzinger, Inventor of Genre Theory or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very strict to me.
But, as I explained to our Umpfrontist friend, it is all the difference between having a clear opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic gorilla, I was pleased with the "Second Sex" (it was more than my time) that I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
While I was looking at the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and offset a little disappointment that sometimes the sight was blocked by the clouds.
It was great here at the FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really include the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash moon of blood.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will make it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with it, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne then, of course, I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover the entire week of the rain of the Persian meteors and for virtually all major astronomical phenomena in recent years.
I'm starting to think that there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from heaven.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are much better on the other side of the Cordillare.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I could not see the eclipse due to clouds above the Melbourne banner.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
QUECTION Looking at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will ambush you when he ends (forcely) by disappearing?
It seems that you spent a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages that people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse EUX of being obsessed.
Super photo of the moon above the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It's like Mars is going to get into a collision with Earth!
Nothing on stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing about inequality between income from work and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
The other liberalism is about to kill Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these preconceptions are not given.
There is no hypertext link to the original documents so that an opinion can be made.
Let us see today Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miracle revenue: in Spain, exports have been lowest for five years.
The stock exchange collapses in Greece.
However, these examples seemed to follow.
The reform of the notaries would generate a claim for compensation of EUR 8 billion.
The Department of Economic Affairs says that these claims for compensation are not based.
What if the Ministry of Economics errs?
Will the decision-makers who have taken the political advantage of the courageous attack of the notaries have the same courage in presenting the bill to the state budget?
Next in time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
@lol No State is not comparable to households with respect to the management of its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically final when the household is driven by the life of its members.
In addition, unless public spending is considered to be unproductive, it contributes to financing material and intangible investments in tomorrow's growth and thus future revenue.
Some elements of the response.
A regretful decision.
But remember the sacred promise of Hippocrate: the health of the benefits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice plot theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasy.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands bound by the law as it is written by the politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having dangerous surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to please the innocent masses.
In fact, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there's some medics.
Doctors don't make money with drugs Since the Liberals want our health system to look like that of the United States, you should learn how it works.
Doctors around the world are being courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to make a mistake about the tubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the profits of businesses and to "search".
So read the few rare reports on our pharmaceutical benefits scheme and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare global drug prices everywhere, as well as the differences between one country and another on what is on sale free or only on order.
This is reinforced by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that restrict them and the expensive permits they need.
Although manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy unless alternatives such as marijuana are used, those who come to a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're mistaken, there's a lot going on in the medical and pharmaceutical cases.
As for this hospital, they were happy to serve it until someone put a bullet in the ears of a hospital manager.
We can't keep patents on the grass...
If "scientists" in social sciences were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, their "work" could be used.
One researcher investigates, he doesn't compare one fact to another.
Compare it isn't looking.
Comparing it is not the teaching of research.
We can't say "search is done we have to apply it" and then in the same jet "we have to experiment at all times."
If your search is in vain, why experiment?
If your search is not completed, why do you ask to be applied?
Can I explain how a "researcher" can draw that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could assimilate mathematics and other materials more easily?
The new technologies allow you to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they get to learn new technologies if they don't know how to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfying.
What's the use of building an indicator that tells you what's going on, a will of self promotion, a fraud?
One track to train teachers: distance from training sophists and ideologists and that practitioners teach practitioners.
factory release the paragraph on the internships (which helas is not very argumented) and you will see that your conclusion moves us to the most ineffective conservativeism: "It is a device that leads first and foremost to the reproduction of the practices in force, and that does not allow the system to progress " .
In view of the general consensus on the state of the French system, it is not possible to wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have all their place in modern teacher training.
Education theorists must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who never set foot in a previous operating block?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to education theorists would ultimately destroy it.
Your analogy is completely false: if I did not want to be operated by a practitioner who has only one theoretical training, I would rather be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the task.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP on the fight against copyright violation by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmayers thank you.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating the copyright, I will just read an article like this one.
In an information economy, the violation of copyright = flight.
That's the same thing because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license doesn't cost anything.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not the same thing.
By using the content without having the appropriate license, you deprive the artists of their bread.
You can always discuss the assumptions behind it - but it's the flight.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become so true.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I'm starting to feel guilty about violating the copyright
Obviously, this does not bother you to deprive artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, a almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be showing how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they leave any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions they have made a click.
Maybe if they share the listeners of their mp3 ballader with a partner in the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in this way.
Ah if we could export this resource that we're looking for, the gossiper who says everything's going wrong....
If it is a PS Member who affirms it, then we must believe it.
I have two children and when they're old to choose, I'd advise them to leave France if nothing's changed from here.
France constantly pulls people down into assistants.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What pulls France down is speech like yours.
@gus I have been working in private business ever since.
I've had the chance of working in companies run by excellent company leaders: it exists in France but it's rare.
I'm paid because I know I don't have the skills to run a company, and this choice allows me to shoot red bubbles on the zero patterns I meet frequently.
At ease in my basketball, I fully share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's position: he says the terrible truth!
@gus, when compared with the German companies that French business leaders constantly quote to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized enterprises - What are the French patterns waiting for?
What's the state holding their hand?
Is that the state they're charging for?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business leader couple on your side!
Remember me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be as severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is facing an unresolved problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who build and undermine while waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, work 45h/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, hesitate to claim the reduction of wages or removal of wages!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
What is ironic is the way people always complain about First Group.
According to where I'm from, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep up rather than transform.
This does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since the Last took care of them.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we don't have the power to do that, ladies and gentlemen.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't make it.
But well, the laborer's gonna get us out of trouble, isn't it...
It's an international branch.
They were already working trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral enterprise and from taking part in calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandals and criticisms when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision is finally canceled.
And there is better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well the Labour, as they have repeated during the referendum campaign, is entirely for the sharing and sharing and believes that workers must all go beyond the borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision;)
This may be because the Dutch administration is on good track while the British one is not.
What ScottRail needs is not just a change of ownership but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio is perhaps the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous system of franchises, not the franchisor.
"He was a beating girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate this kind of expression.
Suppose that being "beating" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with being able to survive a disease: cancer "beaters", which are not less dead, I know of pancakes.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's start again.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you that this is AIDE.
Nothing to see with someone deserves...!
When in the examples of your life, there's only you to judge them.
I'm starting again.
Insinating, it would be only a moment, that we can have the merit of getting out of a disease or that we can demerit from not getting out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that looses, everywhere, despite the will, despite its trust in medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C?
In order to think the contrary, if having a strong morale makes it easier to accept and prepare heavy treatments, to try experimental treatments as did this woman and not to refuse them with fear.
Someone who's fighting in medicine is first of all someone who trusts in medicine.
But if we prefer to give it back to the "Lord" it's another thing.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are for moralists.
When you catch a shit, a real one, you're gonna get to be just a zombie.
Personally, I caught two, salads, big ones, and if I "batted" as these psychologists say, it completely failed me.
Unless this fight is only to close your teeth, to suffer from hell, and to beat your teeth.
I thought that the charge against Milosevic had been decided and concluded a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten anniversary.
His trial was carried out "fast" and then rolled under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
The communist became a nationalist who launched three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the MOINDRE rule of international law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
With regard to RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians, then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The West used a smoke screen to delineate a part of a sovereign State that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was soon recognized by the Western States who then ended up lying on the ground.
The Serbian population has now disappeared completely (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office in order not to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Finally, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as tyrant (even if we did not like him).
In my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting seismic events in Greece is near, measuring the level of piezoelectricity in the quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thanks to sharing the results.
A hope therefore, but caution is to put This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years of Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by the Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine team at the University of Maryland.
Method to be followed.
Just like those that involve animals that feel a threat to come.
Thank you Father of Science to us, often, for these experimental efforts that are carried out in the world.
How could animals (In advance )?
There is no doubt about the perception of other elements whose rate has evolved in the case of seismic diseases.
Like radon, for example.
A gas has an inhospitable priority for man but may be detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments it has.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has often been observed (and for centuries) that some animals have been acting strangely for a few hours with a seismic disease, including chickens, cows, dogs, but especially fish and snakes.
I saw an art report telling the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work on animal sensitivity to earth's magnetic fields, and in particular their modification before a earthquake.
Well, I'm not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we on these research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature...
If we examine things calmly and strictly, we publish it in a serious magazine, and no one despises it.
As soon as we speak of the "signs" given by the animals, we are in the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a seismy the red fish swirled in a strange round.
I don't understand that we can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did too much as mayor of London.
When listening to the LBC program you can't stop yourself from thinking that this man doesn't know anything and that he's always trying to make fun with a joke.
He never answers directly, no matter what.
He also said that he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari asked him what.
He couldn't name one point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor, and he didn't keep one.
It only emphasizes to what extent the rest of the Conservative Party is just a piece of shit, isn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebration and people are being accused of celebrating the holidays.
The Londoners voted for him and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the lead of the party, the popularity of the Touries will increase the ceiling I am sure of.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what the Londoners were saying.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpage, smarter than him.
In many respects, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have really and always been disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have given themselves the punishment of reading a few books (there is, among them, a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "railway" speak, unfortunately, as well as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there in the background since the Battle of Savo) did not want to return to it.

It's just the little ones.

Your account brings me back, identifying me a little by the way (I also learned to navigate with the Crocos de L'Elorn at Moulin Blanc in line with Brest!).

Keep telling us, and be proud to show that the Bretons are great travelers!

Bonsoir I think the good red who has manifested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the British Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local communities and public bodies of any kind should not spend some of our taxes on financing the dreams of some as nice adventurers as they do!
Is there any players in the current Serbian training that is of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevac in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once in Youth and now in Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team.
It's Bisevac the defender of Lyon, not Bajevac.
Bajejic was in the middle of the field or earlier in the 1970s and 80s and has led many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevac is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has played as an attack on the great Velez team, who, under the supervision of legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in the Yugoslav league for a second time (and also had scores such as Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsène Wenger's faithful team, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a big player when he was in Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know that he lost his place when Count came, then he went to Fender and as far as I know he's not the holder.
Maybe he can do something else, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the true Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of the Great Albania, which covers all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, in fact.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give the neighbouring countries a boost from the country.
How could we have felt "an explosion of joy" seeing two tours collapse, knowing that women, men and no doubt children are inside?
How???
What fills me with in this "witness" is that the only thing that has ever been able to, is once, spontaneously rejoice in the terrible death of thousands of people, is in my eyes a "broading line" character, which all "witnesses" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
Without a doubt, in the short time of joy, there will be no thought of the dead or of the reality of the terror involved.
We will have just thought, one moment, that for once, Muslims were able to do truly and apocalyptic harm to the great evil Satan in his own heart.
Make qqch powerful.
That's great.
It would seem that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims wounded by their feelings of humiliation.
With witnesses filmed in Palestine.
Classic damage.
We had some doubts.
The West "Christian/White/Gaulois" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it sees general poverty, the social and cultural underdevelopment of the Arab Muslim world today.
I'm talking about Carie's and Algiers's fuubourgs, not Dubai's tours.
The past , certainly magnificent , is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical darkness?
All in phase, 2 major poisons irrigated the Arab world l: the great conservativeism of power in place and the fascinating nihilism.
The common point, the ice of thought and the excommunication (sweet or armed) of its critical expression.
Whatever it was before, it should not have the Muslims retreated.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess it's true in many countries.
But in Britain, the fall marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressed months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone's getting sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes, it becomes hell for me and for those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
The autumn is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
In particular, the campaign is to cut the suffling in autumn.
Not as much to cut the breath as the summer green when everything is living rather than dying.
In Great Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We've had a nice summer this year, don't make your bunnies that smell like clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely fall sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I no longer develop immunity to germs outside, it can change, I suppose.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of exciting smells, with a febrile that culminates in festivals such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risk of drowning and full of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here's my recommendations for the parties for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the control of the majority for children , this is the amount charged by the State that derives mainly from the declines 8-10 .
But with regard to the number of households that have seen their tax increase as a result of this measure , these are mainly the 4 and 5 deciles that are concerned ( median income ) according to Figure 2 .
The elimination of half of all widows is not fully dealt with in the article, or its impact is fully assessed: 230M euros is a pleasure that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and under the assumption that it is indolorable.
And it's not ready to settle.
Well, we're not on deck, but we're dreamers.
For once the PS makes a policy rather than left we won't cry...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let us continue and encourage these 20% unless you work or start.
Well, I know it's not politically correct, but I'm still saying it.
Live the Trots and OICs recycled in the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from caring as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, the money loses all its usefulness.
And once the utility of money is exceeded, money is only used to make money, that is to say to make the greatest number of misfortunes.
We're among the richest 20%.
There is no doubt that 20% of the households that work the most (and create the wealth of which a part is logically redistributiond).
A fair tax should enable these homes to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or so much as lowering your arms and living minimum social life, especially if you have a social housing.
The utopias of the head cuttings at the red Khmer have happily lived.
I've done two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to present ourselves at the reception or deal with the least worry.
It's enough to go to someone's house, sleep there, rank behind me and leave.
In the meantime, this will be my first option when I'm on my way.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you will need a type of owner's insurance.
Make sure to use a service with the good logo!
Ah, six o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, it's not true.
You just really missed your chance.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
In 24 hours, according to an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locker to change locks, made arrangements for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article make Teman complain that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I plan to pay an account and a month's rent at once, but I'm a little afraid to send $1,600 to a site that I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Support the troops," the Bu$herie sang on all the tones...
So invincible weapons.
I am sure this will please the families and close to thousands of dead Kurds in hallabja to learn that their parents and friends have failed to do anything other than the chemical bombings of Saddam hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain policing).
Furthermore, in what kind of mass crime in 1988 would it prove that chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the author's style: "to seek weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is this the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be much strengthened if "they" were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are now gaining more than engineers.
And we don't believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this is not so because National Education does not have the means to provide a college/lycée office to its professors, so they are at home.
A form of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay the computer, Internet connection, or supplies.
Besides, it's so much the board at 5:00 a.m. per week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the CAPES of maths, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to collect bad-educated tails that your parents call you on when you're treating you as a bully?
I think that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the Khurde population can better expand.
Where it's seen that the Bush administration has absolutely everything going through.
My first job diplomad was to win three times nothing in London and yet it was a job for which a diploma was required.
A year later, I saw an ad to work for the London Metro, it was paid £5,000 per year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, don't do it if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something that pays well, or whatever you like to do.
If I had stayed in my job, I'd still have to pay my student loan.
I don't like business work that much, so I hope to spend both in the public service and in the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I got my degree in 2011 there was already a three-year-old behind.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of loopholes such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is what we call the diplomas of unemployed people.
I have one of those diplomas and I've finished the production director.
It has happened that the important thing was not the degree, but, as the article said above, a good professional course, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course, the starting salary was lower, but we quickly go up the ladders because in the real world what counts is the results more than knowledge.
This debate of engineering studies / artistic lines has lasted for years.
Scientists can't solve all the problems, it's more important to be able to get out in the morning, get to work at the time and interact with people in order to get results.
Are letters, philosophy and art?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about graduations such as media study or whatever the nonsense line you're going to.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are real lines.
We need people who can explain the big questions to the lyceans, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture, such as literature, art, etc., and they value them.
Would this not be better a real territorial policy to disengage Paris and dynamise the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the inhabitants of the final background of the Essonne and the Val-d'Oise doing 80km back every day on the bike to come to work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the intra-muros and the small belt already have many other practical means of transport in common (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several parked and keyed parks, as they already exist in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RMs.
It is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
To the extent that they have great experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for a SEUL bike coupling device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, that's not all right.
When discussing with pedestrians and other users of transport in common the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that arise are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these bathrooms, these trucks, these scooters that run super fast and get rid of the survival of the bikes 2/ we take full pollution in the head For me cyclable tracks are to go, it is necessary to reduce car traffic (urban foot type congestion charge), reduce speed (Paris = zone 30), make compliance with the road code by systematically talking (even the bikes on the bench before it needs to adapt the road code written for the bathrooms 100 years ago on the bikes), generalize the buffer areas after the passage of the bathrooms, do not tires and do not tires.
The cyclable tracks are from apartheid, we must co-occupy but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the Grand Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bike in public transport?
EELV's right.
The goal of 15% of sail travel is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
In addition, the EELVs seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, you better find out who's really hiding behind this massacre.
Index: it's not Russia.
Not sure to like the way the world evolves.
That's awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the CEDH, but I did not hear that a complaint had actually been filed.
Moreover, they should file complaints first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also hope that these cases will be resolved pending the outcome of the investigation report on the accident and the criminal investigation that would ensue.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow Pan Am 103 anymore.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for airspace security, in which case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been killed earlier, Ukraine launched air attacks against rebels in the area, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Did the Ukrainian government take reasonable precautions in view of a clear threat or have it chosen to play with the lives of innocents so that air companies would pay for the rights of overflight in the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their Usurpator government / the ultra-nationalists of Western Ukraine - and who want to demonstrate in large measure that Putin has killed the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their heaven.
The foregoing: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the provision of weapons by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Treaties in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
No chance that Russia will let this case go to the JIU.
It's funny to think that Abbott means in Putin that Australians were murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can provide evidence to support his allegations.
The investigators haven't said anything like that until now.
Calling Ricardo and being such an eco-bob, it's aggravating!
Calling Polare is losing the north is exciting.
The only question is, is today's poorer than yesterday's poorer?
I can't help but notice that those who are most virulently criticizing Piketty's book didn't read it!
It's easy to read, I spent a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of income from work, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the term log.
It shows that the concentration of the capital today coincides with that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, it shows that it is the 2 world wars that have reduced the concentration of the capital from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You're not saying what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this paddle knowing that an individual's concentration capacity has a few limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is fair, we can discuss it without having read the book which is essential to argue in a unique way in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you been reading it?
Is the central thesis of his pavum summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it and I won't read it.
So I believe in the summary of her central thesis, and that's the one that seems to me to be pure smoke.
The concept of the difference between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Isn't humanity all-embracing?
And this added wealth to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the price without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope that this price will not be a burden to the young girl and that she will find her way to live a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of the Western governments that want to prove the old adage that the colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes of happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - even in the popular neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little weird.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn't where she was now, she would have been married to 14 years old.
Is Malala herself not part of these "colored pervs"?
You should not have any "antenna time" on this site.
You're a terrible pervert yourself.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father didn't marry her at the age of 14.
She was 15 when we shot her.
His father runs a school where girls are schooled and he supports equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive higher education and she has the right to decide for herself about her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to marry at the age of 14, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't tell you in a loud way enough.
This may seem contradictory, but may she say that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age
Rather disappointed by this entry for season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange, who apparently has a little trouble finding her character as Marlene Dietrich's partner.
I've just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different, but I have to admit that it's one of the best horror series, one of the best!
A first fascinating episode.
The realization is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the Anachronic Life on Mars of Bowie is simply a turning point.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I prefer to have all of a sudden look at 13 episodes of 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is that, outside Jessica's extraordinary Lange, it's mostly the risks of setting scenes and mountings that sat me down.
In AHS there is an array of original plans that do not make it difficult to accept today's productions.
That I'm a little out of sight to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next season without even waiting to be able to swallow the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but, you say so, there are many other things.
It's not just for me that Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot at her.
Then I find that the series is written, she wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it'll end up like 24 hours of what.
But good everyone does what he wants to do here!
That's what I'm saying "I won't look any more" is that everyone is forced to do the same!
I just share my view of nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think she'll be fatal to him.
But then, here, it's just my opinion.
Let's talk less of tax increases, please - cut off rather in the state's spending.
No, let's increase the cost, please.
Those who wanted to know about the expenses failed.
Deprive of discussions on relatively small expenditure items, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change in orientation that voters seem to call for their wishes and for all this time, in each camp, they seem to be much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clear in their game and find them of poor faith.
Less than 1 per cent of the expenditure.
The "debt" is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country.
The 'debt' is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government getting a third of my income (before even talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it was going to be useful.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been entirely honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, the development aid, High Speed 2, the near-use oil subsidies and the nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you arrive at a figure that makes Labour and Lib-Dem's tax very ridiculous on the most luxurious residences.
Your first $10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 per year will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50 000 would pay around £10 000 (a fifth), etc., and someone with £200,000 pays about £70 000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vineyard, and it's before VAT.
Almost 30 per cent of my money is taken to the source before local taxes and the car vineyard.
I'm paid in a decent way, but not in an extraordinary way.
Not a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let us not seem to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it is not important to know where billions of tax books pass.
How can a unemployed person who is looking for work at the door prove it?
Even though 20% of the unemployed do not seek, that means 80% are looking for and not finding.
Since I'm very unemployed, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruit receives 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances of doing so.
Actually, I haven't had any news from Póle Employ for months, so that means that agents are more involved in control operations than really making job announcements come back?
I don't see the interest.
Because it's not the state to provide work.
If Pole Employ doesn't provide enough jobs, then you need to get out of Pole Employ.
What is this about a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in the present case, we make sure that the unemployed fulfil their duties well in return for their rights.
As a controller, they demand their title of transport to users by means of a means of transport, a head of service, or they are employees of their work, etc.
No one screams at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had a case in Póle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and one of the files, amputated by 40%, had to be stopped.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
Fixing and control currently takes over, while it is statutoryly Póle Emploi that it is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only employees, they are paying the costs.
Non-wage French politicians and politicians have rights they do not have!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance is part of the value of paid work.
More than waiting for killer tweets in Arabic...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will arrest Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then be like the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and displacement of the population at that time.
The Saudis had the mind to ban the Hadj in Mecca this year to the Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
The country reported that 7,400 had seen their request for a visa refused because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim who came from Bosnia and Herzegovina who contracted the variant to Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim who came from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola's patients from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was just good sense, but apparently those "wise" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
No one's getting lucky.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Nothing that last week, people were contaminated after having had contact with people in West Africa even though they took "all necessary precautions".
We can stop the progression of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let us forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical symptoms of Ebola, so that they can be placed in quarantine immediately.
May he pass the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will have deserved the Nobel Peace.
I doubt it will be able to raise in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It's still far from that concept.
It was only 20 years ago that information appeared as the given prize for humanity, while religion, from the brain, may have led our actions since Lucy.
What is the interest of becoming a single Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is widely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not put their feet in the Church in any way, there is only a small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we take away the notion of sin, too "anxious"?
@louise: Sorry the church has no limited vision in France.
And in the world, it may be that it will allow more people to touch...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you consider it to be preexisting in Christ.
Hillel a century ago already said to him, "Don't do what you don't want us to do, that's all the Torah and the rest just comment: go and study!"
Christianity goes well beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces agape.
Do you "make progress in righteousness, in peace, in brotherhood" but without God?
Is that a return to communism? :-)
Next step: Incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who has corrupted moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to take their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, and brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were eliminated and then became forceful and forced into immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It doesn't make any sense.
I personally would choose SoM.
I love Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount.
I'll look.
Of course not at work.
The joy discounts of the computer department block all nice sites.
Hello, is it 30 £ and then 20 % reduction, or does the 30 £ include 20 % reduction?
However, the PC version is only for DX11.
It surprised me, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's zero.
It's time to buy a new video card *make the neck*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll make it up to your library if they decide to serve people who buy it there while they're out of the region.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, in 1940, was France a "pure land"?
So you say, this Nobel Prize seemed like a poisoned gift to me.
Do you need to love France of 40, the "strange missing"?
When we see who gets the Nobel Literature, we wonder if Proust or Dostoïevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano who is already difficult to read in French and who describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobles are more credible, but I honestly doubt that.
Modiano, Levy, Musso only have a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel prize?
It'd be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, they.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at its fair value, if they don't know him already!
On your side, continue to attend Lévy and Musso.
I'm sharing your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso preserve all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize for Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Since I took one in Iceland, I haven't stopped seeing Kia Sportage anywhere.
I think this thing has been following me so far.
Maybe she wants to screw me up?
Or do I fall like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate it?
Hello, DQ - no, not today, I took my doctors.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to Nottingham's beer and cider party.
It was brothel.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were only Camra fans (not to be confused with the camera fans).
Driving on the return Sunday was really tough.
Monday night we went to the grandfather of a pot to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance of starting, I was able to deal with several decent positions.
I hope that if I get to 95, I'll be as vibrant as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came up with a lot of hot stuff on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That says, without wanting to contradict you, I think you're a little away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits the search for the djihadists at the exit of the mosque.
She's signaling weapons traffic without delay.
Either we have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
You have to choose.
It's not keeping our eyes closed that we can access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you are making a monumental counters: the whole of the authorities, organizations or associations representing, Muslim or not, having formally condemned the EI and its crimes, French, Muslim or non-Muslim, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Who doesn't say consensual.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoch Marvel, the doubt exists for everyone.
As I said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and inadvertent to accuse them of prioriating and demanding that they publicly prove to the rest of the French society that it is wrong to doubt them.
This principle is, in my view, the denial of the republic and can only help to eradicate French society.
If there's no doubt, just say it.
Who doesn't say consent, but consent to what?
Agrees to a close relationship with the EI or the conviction of the EI.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to house the goat and goat.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically intelligible.
Alex Salmond predicted that, during the elections, Scotland could "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap broke between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised to keep the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified to lose all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely out of Scotland because they don't have any seats.
They can do what they want in any electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the job losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's going to cry for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP, which will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking he was saving his party but not realizing that he signed the death order of his Scottish MPs.
It is not surprising that some Labourers ask their leader for accounts.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both Conservatives and Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think it's important.
Not if the Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Cutting 8% to 85% is not a super-electoral strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish Members no longer have the power to vote on matters relating to England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband if.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists and it worked.
However, he is still in high school to be prime minister in 2015 and since he has won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, in large, these boxes will be virtually behind every reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is the "Life of the Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the end, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I expect the next ticket: Amazon manufactures your book based on your profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of your secret!
It's gay like a world.
It's definitely stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of the DRMs is not implemented, I still read pirated files, public domain books or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence to offer unmooched files.
I see the price I paid for Kobo, it's no regret.
I am aware of the widespread adjudication of users against the widespread ownership of their private lives.
In your large public library, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (name*c, d**letter, ...).
There are also demanding bosses whose opening and closing rates are no doubt boring.

@Thomas: In the Big Data era, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Attention not to put all the literature in the same bacca.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
These are the data published by Kobo that are, not allowing to identify readers or authors.
But Kobo has all this information, he.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government these last days that the country seems to be headed by a class of schizophrenic boys full of acidic.
It's even worse than taking Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account.
It is interesting that some Erdogan supporters think Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to throw a ball in the foot unless there's something to win.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it's actually getting a ball in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: "The AP reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to reverse Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent a serious warning of reprisals there or whether it merely advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what is really surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
The reading of Indian Punchline is to strongly recommend anyone paying attention to the details rather than to the c*ners balanced by traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read in mind by keeping in mind the realistic / previous warnings from Iran proposed by Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderate" who are seriously fighting the horrible Laic Assad and at the same time the evils of ISIS?
The policy of pipelines moves the world to the edge and I would suggest to those who refer to "moderate" nonexistent ones to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to battle in the Third World War.
"It's even worse than taking Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account" Is there any other religious fundamentalists in the Middle East?
I've got one in my head.
It would be necessary for a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should I?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the least chance of being alive?
A little late for that, my brother...
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, 120 years old?
A little late for that, isn't it?
Especially with regard to the KUP triumphal that planned and directed the genocide, Talat and Djemaal killed just after the 1st World War by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a peaceful location in Central Asia near the same time, when there was a dream of establishing a Turkish empire there.
What a waste!
An impressive master of the sophism of the fatal penis, but besides that, we are looking for the proper contact with the real one.
What a cliché without argument.
The foetus will always hear a heart beating even in the belly of a pregnant mother.
Lesbian couples can simply be a child’s desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Hetero-sterile couples, too.
What about the kids!
What a shame to name them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will be old enough to defend themselves, to say they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay the pension of this woman (?)
The GPA is undoubtedly a temporary "solution" in the evolution of the medicine that our world knew.

The important thing about this is that this practice is framed so that the "marchandization" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren't they also body marketing? !

It is certainly more elegant to make a good in a distant country via the Internet and Pay Pal than to enshroud its responsibilities and or to avoid the scandal in another century near home without shouting it at this time on all roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done on behalf of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
There remains nothing less than the exploitation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh, calm down, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 1970s in the Midlands, I saw it only from a distance.
I had to go there the day because I didn't have the right to go there the night!
But if you like it and you listen to music - this music today it always touches you so much.
I don't know why there are so many shocking comments here about what Paul Mason says, perhaps they are posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article on the foot waiting for your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of Northern England's culture.
No wonder Paul Mason has taken the social and political context well, he understands things very well.
The Northern soul is still alive, but it has been vampireized by capitalism, and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
This says, you can listen to it if you are in the London region in November: 99 psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here's a little article well written and well thought.
your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I suppose you're happy to have escaped from Newsnight.
Last train for Victoria/Exchange Wigan and go down to Wallgate.
They're eating pills.
What the train before Wigan was ince, 15 minutes on foot from Wigan after buying a ticket for the arrest after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently police series entitled Gently Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Cases are becoming more and more poisonous.
Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-coloniser (also in Rabin's case).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahou and their electors all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He wore his clothes, put them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative rose up in anger and said, "What are you talking about?
The Israelites were not even there at the time!".
The representative of Palestine (UN) said and added: and now that things have been clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not decrease the guard ...
That it moves to the anti-Israeli is a clear evidence, that it is not the aim sought ...
Antisionist: But I answered, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And it's always like this since politics is globalized...
Avoid, avoid...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it loses!
You are not responding to the creation of Israel.
What force report has allowed the creation of Israel?
Antisionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force report today!
You doubt it?!!! ...
Besides, this isn't just going around Russell Brand, but the Guardian's journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Many of what he says are just pseudo-chomskystic billaves written not by others.
That's who proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a sequence of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter loves her well, which means it's a matter of immaturity).
A truly victorious charge, with just a suspicion of the consciousness that Russell Brand says some truths, perhaps truths to which we prefer not to think.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrificly some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a populist, but all this history of not voting has been completely misunderstood by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross over the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos that he has posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting the democratic commitment to this is completely useless, both parties (at slightly different degrees) ruling mainly in favour of particular interests, multinationals and rich people, at no time he says simply to ignore politics because these parties do not rule in our name: he insists that rather than just vote and disconnect for five years, rather than to vote and for themselves for political purposes, more people should simply ignore politics because these parties do not rule in our name: he insist that these parties do not govern in the name: he insist that they do not have to vote for themselves, rather than to vote for themselves and to engage in political activities, more people, to influence, to influence themselves, to influence, to influence, to influence, to influence, to influence, to influence, to influence, to influence, or to influence, or to influence, to influence, or to influence on the political levels, to influence..
I do not say that I am necessarily in agreement with his solution (because I think that being politically active by presenting his requests can go along with voting, since politicians are Girouettes who will change their mind if they really risk losing the elections), but it's nice to see all these condensing answers that this idiot who makes Jesus tell young people not to take the punishment to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it's really deforming his arguments.
Its solution is extremely controversial and it would be good if people discussed what he really said rather than simply label it as irresponsible and address his concerns and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The item on the vote has been completely deformed.
The point is that I am really mad at the fact that my vote does not really count for anything.
I want more referendums, the electronic vote, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their electors.
In addition, I contest the idea that Russell Brand's talks are not hiss (written by others).
It is smart enough to have its own speech and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of thinkers and anti-establishment universities from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label " pseudo-chomskystes".
I am convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, make Suzanne do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the head injuries ravaged to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him to his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It can be found in a political discourse that has existed since generations, but which has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - since generations.
This "fronde" is particularly clear to me that the intellectual debate has long since been held in the RDV of the History, where trade historians have become minority and trades of specialists have supported the benefit of thinking of condensed sciences Po for press records.
For my part, I had seen Pierre Bouddieu's intellectual attitude as well as Michel Foucault's, a need to take it to a guilty, emissary loop.
They develop each other's very rational reasoning, but this rationality is based on these emission loops that are the key to their thinking.
Rather, I believe that for Foucault the State was indispensable as a guilty person.
This is a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
The problem of the report to the other was solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchy, neo-lib and /or libertarian pen ( of the two terms the second mark is a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state , the first to seek the State's help for its markets ) within the meaning of at least the state / not the whole state at Foucault .
The old dream of the base that is beautifully organized.
Its thought is built on the guilt of the State: without that guilt, it does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here .
No support from the others.
The left totalitarian remembers the good old time, the one of his god then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you have probably read a chouya too quickly if you have taken the texts of Foucault on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchet places a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, it is an original and respectable thinker.
See this horse orchestrated by researchers in human sciences on the hard left who do not support the fact that we pass the alloy to their mantras, it is quite responsible.
Narcissism and the authoritarianism of these people are unlimited.
An important point to add seems to me to be the position of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellows" I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were nice to me when they learned I was Russian.
In Russia here - the last time in the 1990s, in a market.
The Chinese think like the Whites!
My family lived in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou long ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them have violent anti-Blanc talk.
My father's not happy that his old daughter went out with a White.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s, and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity, people travel abroad and see how others live.
What I have been told is that the Russians are particularly prejudiced against temporary workers with no qualifications originating in the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienian River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the views of Australians on Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I don't support Chinese, while I met two of them in my life (one of them abroad), I didn't keep bad memories of them, all the people were able and, in fact, those in London were very kind, that's the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we're meeting, all people are happy, how to remember who was who.
Do you know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here speak of the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with this White.
How many Chinese men are with Blanches, by comparison?
No one, because there are many chances that the parents of these Whites would assault them PHYSIQUELY.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups marked to the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Maraabout: I'm sorry, but the judicial environment is quite a mark of right.
When it comes to the Judicial Union, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be taken from the relativity of the application of the laws in courts, it shall order two obstacles to be removed.
The political vision of the observer as the actual interpretation of the magistrate.
It remains the mandatory tool of the law to refocus the assessment on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, forces to distinguish between the error and the partiality of judges.
It should be claimed that the acts of justice do not divide between these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance are not the subject of objective analysis.
And so if all this isn't analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
Unless it's only by statistics implicitly revealing that it's very low.
The previous preamble makes it possible to record well what follows in the third ratio.
The one of corruption* of the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The area in question is that of the filial* of heirs made up to the procedure by successive genologists sent by notaries.
This profession is well received at 150 million euros a year, although it is covered* provided by the almost judicial impunity* of the French notary.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this is accompanied by this statistical improvement*, as measured by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genologist and heriters who are reluctant to do so, a whole set of case-laws that are contrary to all laws that favour heritors.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring this kind of rational criteria then a form of lie?
Prices must be totally prohibited.
Still of the equipment to wipe out the disabled.
It can be said that, but my brother has one of these tricycles all over the ground, built to the extent of his size and weight, and it really allowed him to enjoy the full air as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and tires covered, could not.
As we say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could invent a challenge in Top Gear.
The tankchair is EPIQUE.
I think the Wheel inventor never had to clean a dog crotch on a chain.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all over the country, but it's just too expensive.
The long-range Ultra Wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a pen for the longboard.
Here are some hills they'd like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bike, so "you see".
The tricycle all land seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor, however.
Many of them have insurance at their disposal of a reasonable amount.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know we need.
We can't really say that Wheel is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draw, it's not planned to make it.
I am pleased that the "long distance" wheelchair does not arrive on the market, because obviously there is no way to drive this trick.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intense bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under 18 years of age.
Eight-year-olds have lived their whole life under Israeli blockades!
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation as well, as this block imposes a "collective penalty" on all civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs working on their projects turn a little from their cement to the black market " ...
Ah, that's not the language of wood, it's concrete, it's the lady's army.
The references are there to support an argument or a fact.
Antisionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There is a black market that is certain, and recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The United States has a well-maintained land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn't have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded it!
Don't forget, too, just after I lifted it, Morsi had restored the block!!!
And I'm a Western, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Block is Israel-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live on a underground fortress, built against the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat, it's a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you've given it a good thought.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is the very definition of the sharing economy, without profit or loss.
Many are only looking for one night on Couchsurfing.
So it is to be paid (or at least to expect it) in another way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
In addition, owners and trusted tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly with cash, thus converting Airbnb.
Where's the community in all of this?
"What does she rent on?"
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
We don't use the "to let" verb in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, if you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have the good insurance for the boat, make sure that it is 100% consistent with all the safety rules and ask those managing channels and rivers for permission to engage in a commercial activity (which they will definitely refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, in short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought that ships can be moved, stolen and repeated, collapsed, etc.?

Poverty increases in France.

The increase in wealth among the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism won't get worse!
The high funding, speculative, plays with our businesses, our jobs, our raw materials, our purchases, our food, our health care structures, our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold..
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obsesses of the frieze.
To the contrary, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is the financial."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed Minister of the Economy an elder of the Rothschild Bank, a history of better defending the interests of the bankers, only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else in the competition?
You call it how: to return his dress, to lower his pants?
Primary and populist response
In fact, we don't know much about what Marine Le thinks.
Where did you see this?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee has really "refused" to help the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British kerosene in the area.
The sea was bright at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after the sun was set, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Malouins, where, on the photos showing survivors as they are safe, there is a calm and full-day sea.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters at this stage in the area.
Hmm, that doesn't really fit what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion reigned among the German ships as to the fate of the two charred cruisers, who had disappeared in the black after they had stopped shooting, and a race and pursuit began.
The Leipzig saw something in the fire, but as it approached, it saw that it was just a sword.
Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and lives the Monmouth, painted and seriously damaged but still in motion.
After placing its projectors on the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was refused and the fire was opened, finally rolling the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee considered that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 2215 hours.
Concern of reports indicating a British kerosene in the vicinity, he headed north. ”
So, if this is true, the Germans, in the darkness before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had crashed, and therefore could not find survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important kerosene of the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they were disillusioned to benefit from their advances.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should break a path through many Royal Navy ships.
Crodock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes are taken to the UMP to request that it be included in the law that a definitively convicted election be definitively ineligible.
Here's a brave position, which would also touch left-wing voters well on.
But noone, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED A INCRIPTATION TO THE WORLD OF MAJESTRY
When is the prohibition of trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will you tolerate this distortion of equality among citizens?
Irrespective of politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, they are always quick to correct those who will benefit from their inviolability to prevent the actions of real politicians, who are really trying to move things, not the beautiful things that real estate is to the extent that they are sufficient.
I met them in the subway at noon with their little benches" from the basements for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members place enormous power in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same thesis if right-wing trade unions, or extreme-right, were targeting the personalities of its side and leading to a legal-mediatic war against them.
Your claims are absolutely free.
If the right is currently derogating from the judicial moment, it is simply that it has done the facts!
There is no example of a left-handed person who had so much to do with justice, but all those who paid attention to him had not been treated kindly.
On the other hand, it should be recalled that the trade union of the judiciary that is left is not the only trade union of magistrates and that it is minority.
That a minister supports the trade unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you're quoting may be minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancellor, it's not a secret.
The question now arises whether the "mission" of some judges is not more out than instruction.
@ sagas - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not officials like the others: they are the only ones to have the power to accuse and incarcerate everyone.

Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed with the Eurovision, as well as so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens anyway to most stars that don't participate in the competitions.
Rare are those who, after a tube, succeed in doing so to others.
In any case, most singers/groups can best wait for three albums and one of the best.
Yes, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the United Kingdom.
His celebrity comes partly from his marriage with a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it is more likely to start on a career than the typical rock trail, even if in your dreams you think that all guitar coolers who smoke from the grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a third primary school level will certainly become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before they even get out of an album.
And worse than ridicule: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the studied peoples – a distance that turns quite quickly to racism, because the saccharist ethnologists present us these distant peoples as infinitely superstitious and petrily ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing it are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, of practical considerations every day.
Unless you're imprudently in the wrong direction.
But rather than saying that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our way is as remembered to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and confined to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article, whatever it is.
It's from the ephemer deco to furniture the empty.
No more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrative figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacredness still lives on.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw into the ears of the interpretations of any scientist who lives the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When did a critic compare disciplines for a little bit?
Because what is worth for archaeology is also worth the interpretations given by the other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that treasures, precious testimony to restore history, to understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and before archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and their knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Today, technical and scientific means are available so effective that the interpretation of the searches is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
We are here in full (and old) polemic on chamanism advanced by prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf. his book "The Chamans of Prehistory", in particular the increased re- edition of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this highly instructive article
Heteros men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put myself in there.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why can't we go on to three?
This journal is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall in the cabin?
No, but we're not against a play room over there.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy over there in return, that would be too gay!
We could expect to have this kind of comment on your part.
It looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your test offer is almost finished, then I suggest you move to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
I can suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays for real, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and dangers.
Instead of making fun of these dirty ass jokes.
Not very modest.
Go on, then.
If these "poor ass jokes" shock you so much, you're not forced to participate, are you?
Do you also know that this journal also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is absolutely possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that bothers you, or is it the fact that people are messing with it?
However, we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
video amateur crash on the net... ??
If FOM has chosen not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the pilots, it would have gotten out of safety because at the moment or another vehicle (e.g. a trailer) would enter the circuit.
But it had to end quickly before the typhoon that was known to arrive, but for which the FOM did not think it was good to advance the time of departure (tele-right, pub, money...).
But besides, they protect the pilots well.
Well, see, I'm also sharing this opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM has entered the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at restarting to beat the English who was then leading...
You're dropping on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's not serious, I have a little time to take out all your c*****ries.
No, just not.
There have been a lot of conspiracy in F1, but never one who puts commissioners at risk of death for a distant history of the possibility of winning a pilot at the loss of another.
It's not the FOM that gets out of safety because it's the FIA.
Size nuances.
In the face of amateur images, the absence of image allows the FIA to avoid embarrassing issues of the type: How does the Commissioner drive a green flag in full intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it's not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident, but because one of the commissioners clearly acts a green flag, it signes that the race can resume normally and is more under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark ignorance of the F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag regime before the place of the accident, from which the green flag is driven.
It's the usual procedure.
The station of commissioners just below the accident (as the case may be 10 metres or 100 metres after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal hole.
Sensationalism sells from the pub.
I used to think that the media were an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I am very afraid that it is in the end just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, fear of not having sexual life, the pub and the media are good for selling things that are supposed to improve our sexual life.
The information does exactly the same thing.
To do the buzz with information that we really don't need to worry about is just to continue to scare people so that they can continue to control them.
"When tabloids are all about Ebola, we all catch fear" It should be "delaying", not "all."
Given the medical reference, "tosser" is much better said in this context than "tosser".
I wonder if all the people who complain that Ebola could spread by air find that they now believe in evolution?
You do them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Super article, thank you!
A short and concisual article that ridicules and firmly rejects this pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
It saddens me that the media are talking about most things with this optimism on the contrary.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frustrated and anxious (without getting to the hysteria) for the government can get us out of it when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to undergo a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any incident?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of ruling by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still from this world almost 35 years later.
Moreover, it had to be horrible at the beginning, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffed, living with certainty for years..
Testimony is completely useless.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only do the evidence serve nothing: taken alone, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have an adverse influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@trafic: The testimony cannot serve as scientific material.
This may be why we refrain from asking questions to patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record says that my psychiatric mother explains that I have been telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's a mistake, it's a subjective witness.
Ah, because the certification of a fact (= here this testimony, who testifies to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is nothing in a scientific approach?
So, what are your research based on?
On ghosts?
Do you put fantasy theories and facts at the same level (= giving rise to verifiable evidence)?
"Resilience" is the word "bidon" by the great-grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after having read D'sembourg.
@Jim: There are full of empty buzzwords in the dogs.
Kirulnik has struck us with the "resistance".
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will have brigade us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company?
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to highlight the Air Sentinels...
So why?
It was a great series and it seems that those who see it are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to make the kids grow up?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the humour of pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
The kids were shaking.
Ah, because it's a children's show?
UKIP is working for the Mysterys.
So keep your team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the sons and that animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope that it will give the idea of a chain of rediscovering the old.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; at least 40 years ago we have episodes of an hour on Saturday and Sunday at 06 hours.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and can always be seen at these times.
And in addition, half an hour's episode is now going from Monday to Friday at 0530!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old sad guy, but I don't watch this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the plains !!!
The radical Zionists have invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In addition, all Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the plains have not been able to find anything for decades.
The mountain of the temple if it exists is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosque's plan has been built.
Its top, or the dome of the Rock, is in the middle of the Omar mosque.
For Muslims, Mahomet is mounted in Paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, this is Mount Moriah, where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel is also among its extremists, it is good to remind him regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the plan to 2 states, and it was constantly suffocated!).
It is also good to show the extent to which Jerusalem's annexation is not a peaceful fact.
Will God be able to recognize his people?
The shortest of Jewish jokes: "God be praised!"
To boast tourism in Israel, we are often seen as young people born to half the size of the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen on the picture that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary, though.
And this photo is a wonderful propaganda work!
Regrettably, the photographer of Reuters did not take pictures of hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Mount of Temple and who prefer to calibrate the Jewish faithful on the contrary, praying at the Mur of Complaints.
@Mat, If this photo disturbs you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, it's the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she's transmitting that you have to condemn.
This system is not tenacious and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to be running out of business, large companies have benefited greatly from their employees.
They managed to convince their employees that they had a chance to have a job and that they could not afford to increase their wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they gave even more important rewards to the small elite at the summit.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak of one voice.
Instead of rubbing and grumbling when someone else makes the strike, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not being treated with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case, it's tenacious.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All this can't end well.
That's because we're in democracy that it's got.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Partnership for Trade and Investment (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these individuals in short circulation by national governments by secret courts.
This seems incredible, but it is precisely what the dispute settlement mechanism between investors and States (ISDS) proposed by the agreement serves.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
It's just recently we're starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
That's what makes a great impact, while the digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on the trees.
The next low mailbox will no doubt be the car market.
This gentleman is right, at XVIII there were unions in all regimes
In the very French army Catholic, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let there (at last, his officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe in France's eternal treasure of values, and it will fight and close its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the nation's idea, having this small remnant, is comforting.
Even if for her, it's getting more and more uncomfortable...
They still miss the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write the French correctly, I'll be in union.
You've been warned, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of categorical interests, the protected professions with trade unions have already suffered enough, which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of the risk on the part of a staff member.
We can very well imagine a system that provides freedom of expression without unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Or an insured disaster.
And with the charts that are being prepared, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignore In fact...
Ignore for ignorance Sybile I alluded to military and other officials, as this is the subject that was commented here...
Let us delete "through his delegation" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and in business management."
This is absolutely essential with the collapse of the information authority.
And yet you have opened, probably read and then commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off Review".?????
Wait, the section was here, empty.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's marriage that I've been looking at, and I can tell you that some of them have been murdered.
In the episode of Joffrey's marriage, we have one of the best moments (because the trumpeter: it was the wine) in television history.
Also, from the tart mmm...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time the show ends with a victory of burning the worst; no one has done such a "boom, here's my fucking cake now buffer it and bow to your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and parents outside finally had an effect on them?
The previous weeks, all these outside persons were kept away.
And there's also this idea of "playing security, there's always the next week" that disappears last week.
I like cooking, but I don't think I'm going to get into that.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us super fun and motivate us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually spend days doing them, and they had to brittle one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to leave, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real defect they could have found was the base a little dry (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard's mill would not be desired, in any way Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial due to time spent.
There's also the cancer that looks at, with the wind blows.
Definitely, we're all doing it right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field was weakening, there would not be enough solar wind to "hunt" the stratosphere ozone.
There would be even more, and therefore less than UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UVs.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to man they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), heat us (less than infrareds), modulate our immune system and seem to improve our morals.
The ozone layer blocks cancerous UVCs and allows you to pass UVAs and most UVBs.
Do you know that you are not obliged to be condescending and to consider your interlocutor as a stay when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was under-under the comment, which he himself intends to prove to be a pedagogy.
Without saying that I'm used to melanome, UVs are only accelerating its development.
They don't provoke him.
For proof: all bronzed persons do not necessarily have melanomas.
So when a tube tells you to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cave, it's better not to listen because UVs are necessary for all humans.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs directly cause melanoma.
Is it possible to fold it?
And more importantly, can we get him to the mixer?
Or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have found that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the use to which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and it has not yet adopted iPhone6 as a first-line communication equipment.
But for us others,
There's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested have found that everything can be folded if a sufficient force is applied
Save and Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already glued?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth blog on the fold I have read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before you install specific software, you can imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and you can hardly see how it could come back.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...................................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been properly installed and which is therefore connected to the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The Ebay photographs clearly show the absence of a FCC or EC logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah the article for bobo by excellence.
We want cheap products and we're surprised that industrials produce in "industrial" We put forward all the teaching and even small trade are concerned How good buffer, bio avocado 1650€ (average wage in France)?
But to answer your job, if it is possible to eat properly with a small wage.
After each one is free to put his priorities where he understands it.
For me, food is one.
Go without resentment, I'll kiss you
People who see the world through an ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from reality are called bobos, or better boboecolos.
It's the total degrouping of thinking-reasons.
They are gesticulating experts, for example, claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in truffles, joining the left-to-left caviar, which they are sometimes released, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mix of heavy ideologies and truffles, nor are you surprised to encounter often criticisms about them.
Waoh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theory as well as for all the associated details (air, shower...).
I'd love to be a part of it, but I don't find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecoles are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of the left-caviar?
And yet you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in short schools.
In fact, the boboécolo is a part of it, but it is only the most visible fracture of the schools because it is the one that infects the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front.
She's so wrong that she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the stupidity of the truth of this work.
But you just don't have any legitimacy to make a comment because you haven't spent countless decades studying and flirting with great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin doesn't know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she has really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic capacity.
It's the art.
No, it's coke.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
That's not really a good thing.
It's rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are real dog reproductions that smoke by playing the billiard.
To judge art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than simply representing the reality.
If you're looking for that, a camera will make the case.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image talk about itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
What else is needed to make savings: riding activities, the number of horses of the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
Honesty must say that France decreases its workforce, but, as all countries have done, sometimes more drasticly, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
Operational without support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, at a time when we observe weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defense tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow to the local communities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities, or a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctification?
@edmond: That's what I was saying, look at where to make savings, but especially not at my house, it's really not possible at my house...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look elsewhere where the cage is.
That all those who have had little or enough of the military thing dare come here to say, the eyes in the eyes that there is no spent money in this perimeter and this without bursting to laugh...
That the same potion is applied to the entire public service and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really loud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you will understand why the Defence can be a little busy!
Well, the economies that everyone agrees to say they have to do, do you think it's going to happen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those who fall on it are grumbling at the murder when it comes to them, the poor, the poor.
It should be done, but above all, I don't have to worry about it because, in this case, it's a crime and not an economy.
Gignols, go!
How to close the Grace Valley will weaken our defense tool in Sahel?
With regard to local communities, history repeats each post closure, maternity, hospital, home.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It is strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and does not enjoy the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most embarrassing thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It is the depression to expose her son Facebook and to see that 80% of his friends began their status by the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're gonna make a movie.
It will surely be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex in the bus by going to work and finds out only where his jacket is back in his cage.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely con.
Not really, according to me, the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to get his emotions and to close his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of his return on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
They don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I have to watch this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has just shown himself to be above the top of the cosmic universe, which is satirical journalism!
I'm falling back!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible flexibility and insurmountable genius that cheered Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine light.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if they are not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive trend in democracy: the rise of effective regional policies and associated initiatives.
Until the new order we have the right to save our planet by States that play the truffles at each meeting to save the planet.
So, citizens, we decide to take things into our hands.
With the Commissioner that they planted in energy, all these beautiful recommendations were submitted ....
Translate: Sunflowers and sunflowers are the Round points tomorrow.
All financed by the con-tribable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful at the level of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the thread is not fully controlled, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
The renewable energies are our only health, on condition that our consumption is dramatically reduced.
Electricity by the renewable to fight CO2 emissions?
France has nothing to do with it.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for other stages.
Electricity by the renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on the other stages and above all gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittent.
The replacement of the nuclear fuel by the renewable wind or PV would be against the fight against CO2.
Christian I'm not insulting you.I'm the Doctor of State in Physical Sciences 1981. Plus I did nuclear physics research. I challenge you to prove that I did not agree with what I said.
What I didn't say is that you're the one who gave me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany, you actually didn't answer what I was saying, and like all the people on the right to demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to quote the conclusion by the German Government of experts: the current programme of Germany on renewable energy is an inefficient and cost-effective way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you don't count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you don't have the gas vapour with a smaller greenhouse effect than the CO2 it really remembers the two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant divided by water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "giant of South Asia" ... !!!
Last time, Pakistan won against India.
I am not surprised, most Indians who post comments do not want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it's a good sign of your mental state.
It would have been the same if they had qualified South Asia giant India...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandore full of corruption and mafiosios.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was amazingly interesting, Kolkata's Athletico imposed 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot of ways to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to the IPL cricket and now to football, how could we one day compete with our "breathing neighbors"...
The low-cost launcher race pays cash.
It hurts for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the lack of possible design is only shown with a too cold helium.
So maybe we're not in a design flaw, but we're implementing...
contrary to the arian space that is a private society, it seems well that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
They may pay the satellites in frigates who know..
This is so much easier that many media take on the title of articles only - and many readers only hold on to these titles.
In total, this creates a wrong impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
All in agreement with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project while it is just a launcher problem.
