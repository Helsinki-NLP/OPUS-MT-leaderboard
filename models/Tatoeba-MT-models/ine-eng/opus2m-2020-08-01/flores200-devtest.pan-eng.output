The traffic flow is a study of the voice and communication between the two locations.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic trends because hundreds of percent of people are sure they can't determine how they behave.
Fortunately, drivers reasonably operate between the limits; thus, there is some reasonable consistency in the traffic stream and can be presented in numerically.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, relationships are established in three main features: (1) wave, (2) density, and (3) wave.
These connections help to plan road facilities, design and hire systems.
