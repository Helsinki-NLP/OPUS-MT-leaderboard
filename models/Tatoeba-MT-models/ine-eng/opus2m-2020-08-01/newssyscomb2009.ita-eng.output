The triumph of right populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived weakening of both parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of the right populist parties have led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), within which the current President Wilhelm Molterer's position is seriously vacillated, has suffered particularly strong losses.
On the contrary, the EU's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphal return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the Socio-Democrat (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, however, compared to the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5%.
Even worse went to ÖVP, which loses almost 9% of the votes by 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the history of the Postwar Austria and, above all, the literally catastrophic result of the populace, which have led to early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the populars had a significant advantage in favor of SPÖ.
But the electors obviously punished them because they caused the government to sink.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations were made on the possible resignations of the party's president, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it could already happen on Monday during the extraordinary convening of the party's leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the ever more likely way out of the electoral outcome, namely the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition .
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) have made 18% in advance and the 11% in the BZÖ vote - the socio-democratics have at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the peoples to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it was separated from the BZÖ) which has even been the cause of sanctions from the European Union.
On this evolution he is obviously playing Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to work with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Greens Party has also managed to enter Parliament, but it has fallen slightly between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be cooled
If the problem could not be solved with the Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of shellfish in India, it would have been in the opinion of the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If he didn't resolve, then he said that there would be some cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that executive power can hardly enter into legal acts.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was charged and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to a higher court.
Then he can apply for bail and wait for the sentence to be released.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed itself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommends the appeal to the Major Court and then it will be possible to obtain grace," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech party can get into the scene is to provide the convicted people with the "competent legal support", the Indian Minister supported.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been committed to India for many years.
Indians admit it too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, in front of his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We really consider it a deep mistake to arrest and accuse these blind scientists," he said.
The Minister has avoided answering the question if he has obtained from the Indian side the promise to take care of the matter.
"I have obtained relatively many promises," he said.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It is approaching the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with her the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 UN Division workers on ocean and maritime rights issues.
His head, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exhibition and always adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed is still hiding a world that is not well-known with natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metallic minerals and other mineral materials, but also unknown living organisms so far that carry within themselves the key to discovering the medicine against cancer.
The largest background of the land farm
The coastal states have begun to give interest to the submarine.
According to the UN Convention, they took advantage of the laws on which they entered into an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is especially the area of the so-called continental platform, which often extends to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state in question.
This has an exclusive right under the Convention over all the resources of the continental platform.
"In a few words for continental platform, that part of the seabed and its subterranean which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often more than 200 nautical miles," explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental platform must be accompanied by a very broad technical and scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It’s the result of a preparation for many years.
"One of our tasks is to seek legal and technical assistance from the Commission.
The Commission has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three were successful," Mikulka adds.
The recent success of Australia, which has significantly expanded its marine assets, has recorded a global echo.
But also New Zealand has earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the committee last week, about 1.6 square kilometers so more or less six times the same state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will bear fruit in the future from the seabeds, as promised, will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since the "Montego Bay Convention" was ratified.
Where the continental platform ends begins the area of the bottom of the ocean that the Convention has declared the common heritage of humanity."
No one's been here since now has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Marine Foundation is not Klondike," says exaggerating Director Mikulka, "because its individual parties are legally demarcated and their contractual regime."
The Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
If it spreads with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 under the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
He has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is frayed, it's a nearly replica of Tatry's submarine.
"E" can be extracted on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich storage of polymetallic agglomerations containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan explains.
A laborer of the Macedonian division Rober Sandev brings with him a discovery to show him.
It looks like a little potato or with a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, like in the legend of the wake of Golem.
German special units were present for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of hostages – then the experts arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
More and more detailed information is available on the circumstances of the release of the 11 unaccompanied European hostages.
As mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, special German units participated in the rescue operation.
In addition to the army's specialists, the GSG9 units were present on the site, the federal aviary police, the federal criminal office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As the spokesperson for the ministers announced last night, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, left the hostages running.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We haven't arrived for luck," says a spokesperson for the interior ministry.
On September 19th, the aggressors kidnapped a group of travellers in southern Egypt: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end has remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
In the meantime, the liberators arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the released hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
The details of the release have not been explained.
There was no information in Berlin for when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bill" newspaper, 5 vacationers and special units should fly with an Airbus from military aircraft and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
American representation room rejects the rescue package.
The first room of the American Congress has just failed the 700 billion-dollar rescue package for financial markets.
Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 entries to 227, the American House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals by American President George W. Bush and political leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the programme, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been settled.
In a dramatic action, the supporters have desperately tried to persuade the critics from the heavy package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, encouraged Members to consensus, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have recognition to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While the suffrage was underway, the Dow Jones crashed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors' concerns was that the state rescue package could have failed.
It was resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, it collapsed again.
Experts are now expecting other serious turbulences on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force it is necessary for it to have the welfare of both the House of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters record figures to increase bookings
It seems that it will be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to one study, the invoice on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has clearly increased - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite the weak views of the joints, the Germans' desire to travel remains unresolved.
On the reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a plus of the invoice of 31 % compared to the same period of the previous year , as the German association for tourism DRV reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK market research institute, there are increased booking quotas for the autumn months.
Therefore, the excess of travel agencies by October compared with 2007 would have been about 11%, the RDV reported.
Assumed for these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
It would also include travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar allocation, particularly the travels in the United States would be required, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly requested by the Germans, Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as the localities in Germany.
Above all, all the journeys included have a high quote, explained Dr. Klaus Laepple's president.
Considering the increased costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for customers than for an individually organised holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts for reservations made with strong advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking numbers, so much so that over the previous year there would have been a surplus of the invoice - even if according to a further study the number of Germans who took a trip, compared to the previous year, was gone.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Ballermann hits, bottled beer from a litre and vip caught in Dirndln.
A beginning to Wisn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a Dirndl made of size.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, is common: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, the photographers are already shooting against us and taking pictures until they fill up the memory of the photographic machines – very luxurious, and this at my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how our friends do.
The Dirndl of two money seems to reach its goal.
As a tourist of Wiesn and actually resident north of the equator of white sausages, the sense of well-being in costume/dressing to this day remains within limits.
And instead, once you get to Theresienwiese, it's no big deal.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks upset or embarrassed – everything is perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's gourmet gathers strange sights at the banana stand to chocolate.
A monaque tells me that I would have caught up in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the middle you are virgins, on the right you are engaged, behind the widow."
All of a sudden, I've got my back-to-left flash.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make minor losses of technical flirts and wear over hats of fur, on which they cape "To drink to get dressed!" and stretch their bare back against an uninvited.
The boy with display tendencies is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an ooooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo.
This tells me, after he got rid of his bottle of beer from a litre drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, all of whom think it's a potato.
Bob is one of these wildbiesler family members.
Others don't have the luck of getting rid of alcohol this way.
Around the 8th of the night walk in white on the square of the party the health workers, who need to take care of the poor beions
Nurses are always white – every 4 times they pull a tent-covered bar in the tent.
This works like with most of Wiesn's visitors: it goes empty, it comes back full.
Who plays under the tent in this bar of alcohol in the blood, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", one of the sanitaries screams at me and disappears in the baraonda.
Victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being invested by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon incident on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but she died shortly after.
After the incident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with the charge of misleading driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding diplomatic horizons
Shortly before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deeply into the Turkish mainland.
On the eastern side of Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, is one of the most beautiful remnants of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renaissance style.
This is at least what tourist guides tell you.
The building is on horseback between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking around the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The entire building is slightly decadent.
But once inside the office ticket from the ceiling at once, there is no doubt about the size of the company of what was the most passage to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway running to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
But the imperial ambitions of Germany sank during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed
British and dominant forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news about Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a ammunition train broke up destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then, he has slowly gone into oblivion, far beyond history.
But today, this railway break for Anatolia and all the points to the east, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's growing diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created an entire new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
Significantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and obviously with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the bedcart for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main foreign policy experts in the AKP, the Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a race of superballs along the trails that produced the ancient world chains of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn back to its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots is an exemplary move in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspects in the West, more significantly in Washington.
A taxi brings me to the AKP's headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a development suburb, surrounded by commercial centers built and power pastries, where managers in complete business - both men and women - meet to make contracts in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right policy from almost any other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
Cold war was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut off from its interior.
Today you have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one or the other.
They must be both.
"But certainly at a certain point, "I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want to face that choice."
Then he points out that almost all those with whom I spoke here have read in memory: the links between the Middle East and the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as far as Turkey is concerned.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's medium- and eastern ambitions can now be largely in Turkey's hands.
And while I look at the terminal for the ferry that brings me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least then there seemed to be no doubt about which continent to move forward claims about this fascinating country.
Remember speed: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, 11 September) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his municipal music scheme, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under 21/, but at the time the Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to deal with everything the music presented to do, whether it's madrical or messiaen, without accompanying it or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often was Todd told to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the booklet was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or floral.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it more and more elevated.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a knight, an orchestra director would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades that led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the last 40 years and over I have been talking about more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been in agreement with just one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Todd Handley had that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated orchestral directors who, in his words, simply "went around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your neurologist William Woodruff (September 25, 1946) specifies that "in 1946 he began to study economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... at the same time studying for a degree in science, a letter and a PhD".
This results from the note by Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chooses to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his photographs in white and black, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength they convey, although treating the protagonists with particular respect.
A sample that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second attack for Honda supermarkets
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with large housing, this new monovolume has an even wider internal space.
A refined mechanic must be added to everything, which increases the comfort of driving and enables fuel saving.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz aesthetically presents a very similar line to that of the previous model, changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new mechanics.
However, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after it enters the market for the first generation.
Therefore, one first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter times than those used by other producers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in sales.
This is precisely the case in Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, almost one million Jazz units have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 estimates were about 100,000 cars, assuming an increase in sales of 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish affiliates are expected to sell around 2,000 Jazz units in the course of one year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the drop in sales in Spain to a good extent.
In fact, the company's managers plan to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, i.e. 4,000 in less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company is expected to reach 2% in 2010.
To succeed, Honda trusts in another new model.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4.37 meters long - from which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year around the world.
For the markets and according to the estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of the sales of Insight will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation in society in January in Valencia.
With respect to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimeters in extra), the width is 1.69 meters (two centimeters in extra) and the radius is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the living interior is also expanded.
This advantage derives from the introduction of a new platform, and from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the luggage – with double background – is 399 litres, that is, 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the engine version 1.4 and that the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 luggage is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in access to rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions are opened with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also, the engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with 1.2 and 1.4 litres of petrol engine.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower your consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time keep the engine pair high at all stages.
The 1.2 litre model allows you to use a power of 90 cv to 6,000 spins with a maximum pair of 114 Nm. to 4,900 spins.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached the 78 horses – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
With respect to the previous propulsion, which used 83 horses in the first generation model, they are now available for 100.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses reaches a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "car app" to avoid collisions
In the context of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, for example, takes the flight of bees, can avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Two, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-area Security Shield produced by Nissan.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicle of the manufacturing house.
During the flight, each water creates its own personal oval-shaped space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the eyes made up of bees, able to see in all directions with an angle of more than 300 degrees, and allowing the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers have developed what they have defined a laser location (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism detects the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor on board that can immediately prevent collision.
"At the moment when it detects an obstacle, the small robot imitates the movements of an ape and immediately changes direction by turning on the right or higher angle wheels to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and engineer leader of this project.
Unlike an ape, the robot cannot turn upwards or downwards, or even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can rotate its wheels and not exploit infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act on this data.
It does not require the memory of information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruptions and with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about memory gigabytes, and not mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan hopes will be serious in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the type with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to the destination by avoiding obstacles present in the path.
Trembling before asking for a loan
We must recognise that the U.S. Treasury Department, as well as having many capitals to intervene, is certainly not free of ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and in order to prevent Americans from getting involved with money-laundering loans in banks with dubious insolvency, they have created a fun and educational game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the Hotel of Bad Credits... or the problems.
The tetro look of this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to make you think not one, but two or even three times before you ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary objective.
Certainly the information provided by the game is useful, but it is not detailed.
It is more a page for adolescents than a website for the general public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, it looks like a dream room inside the hotel.
It's still something, because to buy a better house if you don't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a 21% stake in the Company, following a net decrease in its shares in the Stock Exchange.
One week after the conclusion of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would have purchased 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's equity at an individual cost of $25.25, or an amount equal to $3 billion.
The fixed price is less than 19% than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of securities convertible at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a 10% return.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall transaction would be based on an average price of 29 dollars, i.e. a percentage below its current rate of 28%.
About 5 p.m., however, Morgan Stanley dropped from $6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding company," explained John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow him to differentiate his actions by making him subject to the Federal Reserve control.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than the previous one.
The terms defined on Monday also show that in the last days the agreement has been amended: last Monday, Morgan had just announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese colossus for an amount equal to $8.5 billion.
"One week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of the MUFG, explained: "We thought our participation rate would be exclusively composed of ordinary actions.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will receive Morgan Stanley at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter were exchanged more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. at approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by the MUFG will allow them to take investment opportunities, strengthen their budget and increase their liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has clearly stated that he has relieved his budget since the end of August.
In the last few weeks, the group has tried hard, which has seen the value of its own actions moderated, while the cost of insurance against risks has been reduced.
The cost that flowed on Monday, however, remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week the Goldman Sachs, the only other "survived" among Wall Street's major investment banks after the fall of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the discovery of Merril Lynch, announced that he had spent $15 billion, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffet group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Founding the republic on a socialism right in the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales et of Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, he was the last to vote on the draft new Constitution.
A mission that has been carried out since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on the basis of 80% votes.
According to these results, "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were nothing and 0.7% were white.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the votes should be cast, more than one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the end of the election seats and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a staggering victory of "yes", placing it between 63% et 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed elsewhere in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed gloriously", he had assured himself, congratulating the Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south-west of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated themselves on Rafael Correa, as did her Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in all quiet accordance with the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the President.
This draft Constitution dedicates the power of the state to the economy, reserves it the "planning of development" of a country that lives essentially from oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently from their currency.
Designed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives more power to the head of state, which can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, with the possibility of disbanding the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to propose its application for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states that health and education services are free, which the President has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will terminate the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Ciad
An Egyptian command launched a raid on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held prisoners in the desert for ten days were reported Monday afternoon, healthy and safe in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released from Egyptian command in Ciad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, about 15-30, on board a special aircraft.
On board a helicopter, they were immediately transferred, without being able to issue any interviews at the press, at the Maadi hospital, a residential outskirts of Cairo, to be analyzed.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom "to kidnappers" has been paid," said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the landing track.
On September 19, during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept away from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group was made up of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Egypttous, the organisation agency of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night, shortly before dawn.
"There have been disappearances, half of the kidnappers have been killed, while the others have escaped," said the manager who demanded to keep the anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by the German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We must admit that if we achieved this result, it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding any further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese Patrol Army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board of which the kidnappers were found and to have killed six, including the Chadian kidnappers leader, and to have captured two.
According to the army, kidnappers would be linked to an organization of Darfur rebels, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a statement that the latter immediately denied.
Letter- The silent majority of culture
On the first page, a debate on the financing of culture on which the current electoral campaign is focused.
That's better.
But part of our cultural life always remains in the shadow.
Who will speak to denounce the poor sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
What policy will it take to remind the federal government that is neglecting heritage monuments and buildings?
What in Quebec, like in Canada, do we not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three million and a half euros on the only restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is the Constitution to affirm that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by common agreement.
In Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers at the Québec Federation of Historic Societies are grouped into 211 companies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archive and heritage property preserve, with four moneys, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are those who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states, through partial nationalisation, help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which is already in trouble first in Europe for the crisis in the US credit market: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interests also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can be a precedent.
According to Sunday night's decision, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of the Fortis had begun with a vertical collapse, serious signs of institution crises had then been presented in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to fail.
The bank's shares fell almost 12% on Friday, the lowest point for 14 years.
Since January, the value of the actions has been reduced by more than two thirds.
Considering the current prices of the shares, the group's total capital value is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the bank's leaders, this value is not real.
The corporate summit calls for the collapse of Fortis's actions in the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday the title resumed slowly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed a new deputy administrator of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers, but so far no one has come forward with a worthy offer.
The previous Belgian government had already ensured that investors should not be afraid of losing money.
There was no panic among the bank's customers, and the subsidiaries weren't attacked.
In Hungary the Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
The wolf in the cock
In America, life and health insurers, based on medical data, often refuse to provide an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market becomes uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like trusting the wolf" - writes the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies shall subordinate the insurance rate and the corresponding figure in case of leftovers to the health status of the client and if they consider the risk to be too high they shall not prescribe the insurance.
A long time ago, the client had to submit to a medical visit and the contract was prescribed only after the outcome of the exam.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the customer identification code, you can easily have information from the medicines you have bought in the last year and half, and from this the evince program of which diseases are suffering and in which health conditions are found.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers this means that the fat level in the blood is practically infinitely high and is classified in the higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in trade, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer, besides paper work, is not much left, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the opposite there are some medicines that are useful for several purposes, for example some compounds are useful against hemicrania or heat vampires, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance - commercial point of view, is a risk factor, the first two are not.
For the request and processing of data, companies have formed a separate company and these companies, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacists, require patient approval.
The authorities are now obliged to do so even if they have not so far made much money for neglect.
Some companies recently also develop the results of laboratory tests and link them to drug consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data and, at the same time, control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a legislative proposal that gives the authorities the power to control data-processing companies.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: this is why he has developed a program that connects the data to the consent expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot deny the approval so much because otherwise the insurers do not provide for the contract.
Then at the end of the day, hens are entrusted to the wing of the wolf.
Global Marseilles Menu
The European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade particularly each other, the agenda of the ninth summit was also dominated by this issue, in addition to all the other global problems.
Today there will be a French-Indian summit which will address first of all cooperation on nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a great democratic power to which it should give more voice in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to decide whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So we did not insist on this issue at the ninth summit organised yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in 5 years, that is to increase up to EUR 100 billion, trade.
Since between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods has risen from 25 to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious goal.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements, so air traffic can also take its course in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only at the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit devoted attention to global facts.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for a UN conference.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Round trade, although both parties had a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its persistence in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to establish a global agreement on the climate conference scheduled for next year and to reduce the production of greenhouse gas by 50% by 2050.
They also want to stop the increase in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will now stand in the French capital where he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is expected that to build Indian nuclear reactors, French companies will receive a 20 billion-euro commission.
According to information from our press agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt.
Over three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The International Book Fair in Frankfurt expects for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries to occupy 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand exhibition titles and with Turkey as guest of honor.
He will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government at the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be present institutionally with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will follow the press meeting at the Room Struktur in Buchmesse's 5.0 Pavilion: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of the publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of the foreign author's books gradually decreases over the total Italian production, and in particular over that of adults and boys.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the billionaire disappeared a year ago
Steve Fossett's aircraft was recovered, the billionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying on the Nevada desert.
The ruins were found on an altitude of 3,000 metres, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Within the plane, however, there were no human remains.
The Sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, ran away the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it was exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old was killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) has reported that a team of investigators was sent to the retreat a few hours after the notice was sent, which then identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, which has been scattered since 3 September 2007, when Fossett withdrew from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fossett had been found by a couple near their home of Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a helpa.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of primitives.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world's round on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he made the world's round in flight and without a ladder.
Among his many records, he also flew 15,445 metres high, above the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv out of the schematics with an original design and well defined by decided lines, wide surfaces and clear angles.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the "compaties" of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to make a sale of news in this sector.
Just for its content outside the traditional cannons, it will be unexpected and unconventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17 October.
So the advertising beatage that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unpublished mode of communication also through an adventurous 3D affidavit campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A maxi-affission project, which is divided into three different phases, will dominate the central route of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como you will be able to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image will give you the impression that the car is getting out of the manifest.
Next, using the innovative Enlightenment8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, and then recompile into a single image.
No doubt Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something again into the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
Will this formula help stifle the interest of future buyers?
Here are the Italian hooligans
From the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the National Blue for years and has never created too many problems so far.
He'd never met with the opposing fans.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The proponents come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia, groups (little units, in fact) were added from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-colored flags where they compare the cities of origin of the militants: Saturday night they were taken away to not be identified.
They're inspired by the English typhoeria.
In Bulgaria they found a typhooria of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominations, then easily controlled.
And the Viminale had checked them all: among those matches for Sofia, there was no one with a Daspo on the way, no one who was stopped from attending a stadium.
Four Azzurri fans, who had prior stage crimes, had in fact been denied the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police and then take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents not only Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in other words, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is fear-emulation: that is, to those few more than one hundred and fifty, they add more.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves this way," they say from the Viminale.
So, "well-opened eyes especially in view of the national match of Wednesday in Lecce".
In fact, Puglia has a small nucleus of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory will meet, Tuesday the Casms that can also count on a section of Asia, i.e. secret services, which deals exactly with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce belts and the strapped arm during Mameli's grandson? In Bulgaria it's not committed..."
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks director of the Viminale Observatory (has taken the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly east of Trieste where there is a nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it was not committed to subjugate the Duke but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I do not make the sociologist - he adds the observatory's No. 1 - the crimes must be attributed to the country in which the event occurs.
So far this group has remained in line, now we will see well what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But we're also talking about figurines in Mameli's grandson: even those are not committed, but if you allow me, they're not education...".
