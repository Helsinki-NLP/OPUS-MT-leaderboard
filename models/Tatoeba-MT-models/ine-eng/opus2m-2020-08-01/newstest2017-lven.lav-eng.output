28 years old meal found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week a 28-year-old meal was found in a large store hall, which recently moved to San Francisco .
But the brother of the sacrifice says that he can't think of anyone who wants to do something about his brother, saying, "His life has finally begun to improve."
The corpse found at the Westfield supermarket on Wednesday was identified as the 28-year-old San Francisco resident of France Galicia, said the representative of the San Francisco Medical Expert Office.
The San-Francisco police reported that his death was recognised as a murder and is now under investigation.
The victim’s brother Luis Galicia tells the Sanfrancisco radio station ABC KGO that Frank previously worked as a baker in Boston, but six months ago he stayed at his dream work restaurant "Sons & Daughters" Sanfrancisco.
The representative of the restaurant Sons & Daughters informs that the news of his death shocked them and shocked them.
"We are a small team that works as a united family and we miss him very much," said the representative.
In this difficult time, we think of ourselves together with Frank’s friends and family.
Luis Galicia says that Frank was at first at the hostel, but lately life has improved.
"He went into the new apartment and met a girl," Luis told the KGB radio.
Luis Galicia claims that he does not know who he wants to do over his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He's always brewed his family by making delicious meals and cooking lunch," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in a fight.
He was the brother who adapted to others.
"In view of all the things that have gone wrong in the world, he was like an unprocessed diamond that every day seemed to be muffled," he says.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call the SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
New Doctor's strike: Calling for New Protests
The representatives of the new doctors ask their trade union to launch protests in the dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association (LMA) New Committee of Doctors (JAK) is preparing to ask the Council to support wider protests in early September.
JAK believes that ministers have not been able to raise doubts about the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
Against the agreement, 58 % of all the members who took part in the vote voted.
On Thursday evening, in a post published on Twitter, JAK Council member Elena Makcorta points out that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the contract proposal has been rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JAK vote has totally rejected the offer of the contract and has decided to request new formal discussions to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the development of new contracts, which would enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors participated in six strikes, including for the first time in NHS's history.
Following the vote rejected the terms of the contract proposed by the LMA recommended by the BMA, the new medical representative of the LMA, Dr. Johans Malavana, resigned.
Before meeting with 54 000 young doctors and medical students, he had told members of BMA that the offer was good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the Secretary of Health, Jeremy Hunts, informed that the contract would be concluded with the British medics.
Russia and Turkey: Standby Alliance?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to discuss and announce the end of the eight-month term and economic sanctions war.
However, when Vladimir Putin congratulated the Turkish leaders at St. Petersburg Palace, they felt that Ankara needed these partnerships more.
However, both of them fell apart.
Vladimir Putin’s smile looked at the plot and did not cause warm emotions, even taking into account his usual abstinence.
On the other hand, Tayjips Erdogan at least five times cited Putin as his "sweet friend", an overview of the news meeting.
I don't know. I don't know.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to the pre-crisis level but will become even stronger.
On the next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
I think her enthusiasm is causing conflicting feelings.
But the radiating cold from Putina shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was that the Russian plane crashed on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow responded.
Putin accused Ankara of putting a danci in Moscow's back.
The offense was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
It will be very difficult to regain true faith, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, however, Russia's public position has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television has spread aggressive charges against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that everything was Turkish.
The most serious accusation was that Erdogan’s own family benefited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled Syria.
Of course, he refused.
However, the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received the apology of President Erdogan.
Russia could see it as its kind of victory.
The benefits of the Ankara peace agreement are obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after a failed turn last month, where he tried to gas.
The countless terrorist attacks have also undermined his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused considerable losses, particularly the ban on charter travel, which usually ensures the flow of several million Russian tourists to Turkish resorts each year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also be relieved when regular flights are renewed.
They look forward to holiday temperatures in the Mediterranean season according to season.
Already this week, national TV plans to reduce the prices of fruit and vegetables as imports of Turkish fruit and vegetables will be restored.
As the local newspaper Vedemos quoted: "Tourists to them, Tomatoes to us."
However, the visit also had other political motives on the Moscow side.
Ankara is angry to the West about its weak response to the turnaround attempt.
There is also room for dissatisfaction with the long-standing negotiations on EU and Putin's accession, which are taking advantage of the situation of Turkey's retreat from the West.
The Russian leader no doubt gained additional points in Ankara's eyes, expressing support for its elected government after a turnaround attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well because it itself has deeply rooted fear of the regime's change.
The summit, which took place in this narrow coastal castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present itself, as one analyst called it, "the distant alliance", the two countries that feel distant from the West, combine forces.
However, despite public unity, there are still significant differences in views between the two countries.
The main disagreements affect Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peace-bearer, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, not wanting to disclose information, both presidents announced at the press conference that they had not discussed this issue.
Turkey's President has deliberately avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language on the issue of Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters, when NATO member Turkey defeated the Russian fighter aircraft, the situation has improved as at least both leaders have resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The SME brand will continue to play a role in support as announced by the Bank’s Executive Director.
It will no longer be available outside Scotland's GDP.
Ross Makevan tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with bank ambitions globally.
It has rejected these ambitions because eight years ago the bank was almost bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
In the meantime, experts in the branding strategy have used the SME brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with the Six Nations Reggie and ending with the Vimbledon tennis champion Andy Murei.
However, it is now decided to put other national brands in advance.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all references of SMEs, outside the main office and the official stock exchange list, will be replaced by the name of NatWest.
In the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the brand The Ulster Bank is already being used.
Now there will also be less private financial brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Makevan was interviewed during a trip with customers and employees across Invernesshire.
He told the BBC Scotland channel: "SKB will become our investor brand and with which our employees work, because now we become more of a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
The SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring the Six Nations and will involve various brands in sponsoring sport.
"It's time to become a brand bank because we've been asking ourselves a long time ago how to become a better bank for our clients?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our clients and develop these brands.
But thanks to heavy work and focusing on customer needs, not on our own needs, we have evidently made major changes.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
Frankie Detori won 3000, winning first place in Newmarket with horse Predilection
Detori is recording the champagne by winning his 3000th victory twice in the first match in New York City.
On Friday, French Detori won his 3000th victory in the history of Britain, winning the first place in New York City.
He achieved this by winning the second victory in these races that took place in his hometown, with the predilection that John Gosden is training.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that has achieved such results in horse racing.
He has joined Ser Gordon Richard, Doug Smith, Lester Pigota, Peter Edery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion of the game, Detori, who had won before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very upset because my family is here.
I am very happy that this has happened in New York because I have been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big game, it is not a Royal Askot, but it is a regular Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I felt relieved and very grateful.
After victory Detori and Predilection are expected with applause and forks.
Two jockeys have achieved this record competition with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and the last 20-time champion Sir Antonius McCoy, who set several scores in his career, winning more than 4300 wins.
Lester Pigots, a nine-time winner of derby, won 4493 wins during his career.
France is one of today's best jokes and there's no surprise that he's been successful only rarely.
He is stylish and powerful, but his tactics make him feel different from other jokes.
He's a fantastic competition representative, his enthusiasm and charisma for years attracts fans of this kind of sport.
A few weeks ago, I would have told Frankie that he had already won 6,000 if he did not participate only in the weekend and in the big games.
However, it is a real joy for France to win the United Kingdom regularly for 30 years.
He is a life-splendid man who uses the British in a great way, and he is an excellent joke.
Franks Detori noted this achievement with his sign of the company - the flying decision.
From the windy wind speed to the flying fate, France Detori has been a British horse racing face for twenty years.
This has been a full-fledged journey.
He has won countless great competitions, including the famous "Great Seventeenth" in Ashko, and has also survived an aircraft crash and a disqualification on the use of preparations.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength by challenging those who doubted him by returning to his best form.
And he could participate in the competitions for some time - Detori has previously said that he would like to continue his participation in the competitions at least under 50 years of age.
Russian President Putins resigns the director of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putins unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov, the head of the administration.
Ivanov has been in Putina’s closest circle for many years.
A 63-year-old politician is currently appointed as a special representative in nature and transport.
The Kremlin Communication states that Putin "has decided to release Ivanov from the duties of the head of the Russian administration", without stating the reason.
In place of Ivanova, Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vaino is a good diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (IMSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
As a message from the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later led the management of the President's minutes and government staff.
After his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work as the President of the State by drawing up laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to quit his job and recommended Vaino as his substitute.
Is the smile sure?
This step has shaken Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is a sensible and close associate of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked at the Council Security Service.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a national television broadcast session, both men announced Ivanov’s resignation on his own initiative.
But in spite of the smiles directed at the cameras, which are rarely confirmed by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of the struggle for power?
No one knows.
However, the official statement that a man who was considered a potential president suddenly wanted to become a leader of Russia's environmental policy is taken by a great deal of skepticism.
In the comments published on the Kremlin website Ivanov says to Putin: "It is a fact that in early 2012, I ask you to entrust me with this difficult job, even to say, a problematic job, four years.
It turns out I've been working in this office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov was appointed in December 2011.
He was previously the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the State Security Service of the VDK as well as Putin.
At the end of 1990, Putin led the Federal Security Service, the successor of the VDK, Ivanov took over his post as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five men he trusted most.
At the end of the second term of Putina Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the Russian President as Putina's transfer to the third term would be anti-constitutional.
At that time, however, another close companion of Putina, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became Prime Minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the presidency.
Fishing show in a garden in Banfas
A man from Banfas asks for help to find out the circumstances of the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Beins thinks 75 fish could be sand snakes who left with a water rod.
Mr. Beina, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video on the Periscope website, hoping someone could know how these five centimeters of large fish came into his garden.
Kvinsferi crossing: the bridge is now connected to Faifu.
The projects worth 1,35 billion are currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensland Cross and viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faif.
The first of the four connecting parts has been completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is close to the end.
The construction of the Faifas bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It consists of 10,000 tonnes of steel, 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
The projects worth 1.35 billion are currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown was on his way to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensferium Bridge."
In this project we see an insurmountable engineering solution, where only more than 30,000 tonnes of cement and steel are used in the construction of this part.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and viaduct is an extremely delicate process requiring enormous precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the last stage that will connect the bridge with Rositu will be included today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for insertion.
The fourth bridge connection project director Michael Martins says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the engineering industry of the highest class.
After the last stage of the road and its connection with the support of the north tower, we were left to connect the northern stage of the road with a part of the ground or viaduct.
This was done by stifling the part of the north accessory viaduct 700 millimetres south.
It was a huge and at the same time a very delicate operation.
Great because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and had to be raised by about 3 %.
Delicate, since the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was only a few millimetres.
Luckily, everything worked out fine.
Simon Bails gets gold for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the mess.
Simon Bailey doesn't worry about it.
Dynamic jumps.
No effort shall be made to complete the swings on the beam.
Impossible on the floor.
Not to be blamed.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, 19 - year - old U.S.A., a gold medalist fought, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic scene.
Her total number of points 62,198 was more than the result of the silver medal winner and her team member, Alia Raisman, and the Russian athlete, Alia Mustafina, who won the bronze medal.
On Thursday, US sportsman Simona Bailsa performed a ceremony on the individual finals for white sports women in the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bails became the fourth American in a row who won the title of the championship and the fifth best winner, gradually strengthening his reputation as the best winner of his generation and probably in the history of the best winners.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears, for the long way to this moment was over.
This achievement brings them to the vicinity of impossible athletes like Michael Felps, who raised his sport type at another level.
For the last three years Bails has dominated in his sport by winning 15 medals in the world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing so excellent, accurate and ambitious combinations of rings that the 1984 Olympic Championship Mérija Lu Retone called him "the best winemaker she's ever seen".
In Brazil she was expected to be the last test where she had to deal largely with the hopes that lay ahead of her rather than with the other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas, without gold medals.
The US athletes Simona Bails (left) and Ali Raismane are fined after the respective gold and silver medals in the finals of the finals for women in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bails on Tuesday, making special selection coordinators Marta Karolji adjudicated.
Although Bailsa claims that there was nothing like that in her long journey to fame, it is not true.
Part of her performance in the free movement, which included her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would be very close to the arena of the Rio Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by her parents when she was still a baby and who was discovered by coach Eimia Burman's mother on a sports trip to the gym where Burman's tenure took place has now become the force to be counted.
She has not lost in the competition since summer 2013 and victory series can continue as long as Bails wants it.
Although Mustafina was slightly guided during two rotations, it was only an illusion.
The balance band and free movement - part of the game where Bails will defend his champion's title is still ahead.
She moved forward with a score of 15,433 to the white and strengthened the leadership with a score of 15,933 in the free movement
Raismane slowly swallowed her up while she waited for the results that were just formality and she burst into tears of joy when she realized the dream she had once recorded in her book.
Raismane’s result was as a small excitement for four years of old events when she shared third place with Mustafin, but lost her fight for bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, called the Americans as "parents", took the lead.
After delivering the free movement, which raised doubts about her return, she was able to focus on her breath.
Still 19 years old Bails' viral Twitter entry r, which she published this week, already has a completely different meaning.
6-year-old Mahai Brown lives in Philadelphia, where he is shot by a "scarlet-scarlet-scarlet-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-scart-s.
The police reported that the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, indicating that he was already the second six-year-old who was shot in Philadelphia this week.
The parents of the child to the CBS Philadelphia news channel confirmed that it is Mahais Brown.
The parents say that Brown was shot several times, including a circus, a leg, a hand, and a stomach, but he was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
Her grandmother, Delores Melendez, tells television: " Her little body was simply a mess of windows."
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has already undergone several operations.
The family informs him that he will certainly recover.
He had to start his first class at the local elementary school.
Brown is one of the four people who were killed in the German city.
Three men were also shot: two 29 - year - old men and one 32 - year - old man.
Canal CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, but the other two sufferers are stable.
The canal reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car near the age of 29 in critical condition.
The other two victims were not found in the car, and the police were investigating whether any of them had been attacked.
The investigator told channel CBS Philadelphia that several shooters were most likely involved in the shooting.
At the site of the event are gun-guns belonging to various weapons.
It seems to have been a long-lasting question.
Both walkers are found on the side of the road.
"That's why it seems that there have been several armed shooters here who actively participated in the shooting," says Philadelphia police chief Antony Ginaldi.
A number of homes and cars have also been damaged.
No one has been detained yet and it is reported that the police are checking the surveillance cameras.
On Tuesday at the time of the shooting, a six - year - old girl was stabbed in the hand while she was playing in front of her home in the West Bank.
She slowly recovers, but the police are still looking for the guilty.
Why do we need Simon, Gabia, and Laurie?
I call it the Year's Women's Olympic Lightball Team for a number of reasons.
First of all, I've been on all summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been so good.
Second, this team has three lightweights, Simon Bails, Gabia Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who inspire many new girls of origin.
People may be proud that this team includes also Ali Raisman, a Jew and Madison Kocian, a Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
In the last four years, the best winemaker is an African American.
Last year, Simon and Gabia took 1 and 2 places.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games, Gabia Douglas became a surprising Olympic champion, and America was able to win.
Now the world has seen the incredible feats performed by the three-time World Championships Simon Bails, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row, winning gold medals for individual women.
His team member Ali Raismane won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can do, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different in the exercise hours.
Simona, Gabia, and Laurie joined the Olympics, as did Ali and Madison.
They are the "Olympic Five" because the next Olympic exercise team will be only four athletes, and this is the last year of coach Marta Karola.
In fact, the vintage is a precious sport. The wineries mainly practice in private lightball clubs, and they are provided by parents who pay for trains, rooms, travels, clothing, hotels (trainers, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these lightweight clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes spend all their trainings, and it is a costly and long investment for lightweight families.
Emija Burman - Simona Bails' coach and Megija Hainia - Lauria Hernandez's coach has been training his athletes since the two girls started working with lightweight.
We need to provide opportunities for young girls who are inspired by Simon, Gabia, and Laurie to do cheaper exercise.
I founded my lightweight organization 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15,000 young people of the city (mainly black and Spanish) free of charge or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September we will discover a branch office in Detroit (my hometown) to provide local young people with the opportunity to learn about this great sport.
The lightweight develops strength, desire and coordination of the body, as well as learns to work hard, discipline and pursue goals.
This combination provides a long life with good health and success in both school and work.
This team inspires thousands of young girls to be trained in light and fantastic.
Working with this type of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Ali, Gabia and Madison for the excellent demonstration of the "Golden Power" by winning the Olympic Games and by motivating countless new, diverse girls of origin to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremiah Hunt’s offer was rejected, young doctors plan to develop more strikes.
The ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the UK Medical Association, but rejected it by 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Hunts announced plans to conclude a contract, indicating that NHS is in a unstable state and that further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed the new contract, which provides for changes in working conditions at night and at the end of the week in order to improve working conditions in unstandard working hours.
Yesterday, BMA’s new physician, Dr. Elena Makourta, announced that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will deepen the labour crisis and that it does not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
Eight weeks remain until the first group of new doctors sign the new contract, so progress should be made as time is not left.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the problem through negotiations have been confronted with the government's unwillingness to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
This happened despite the fact that last month, Jeremy Hunts said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act immediately, stop acting and cooperate with the new doctors.
If he does not, young doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were delayed at the end of April, while months and consultants tried to replace doctors who had been in the bag.
The ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the UK Medical Association.
BMA wants to increase the rate of work by the end of the week for 54 000 new doctors covered by the new contracts.
NHS Employment Executive Director Daniel Mortimers called on new doctors not to give a strike.
Mr Mortimera explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increases the pressure on the workers and concerns, creates stress and delays in patients, caregivers and their families.
In the last two months, we have spoken with the new Committee of Doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, have responded positively to their questions about providers and rapporteurs.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues such as staff placement, flexible training, in addition to training for those who return after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, abandonment of studies and gender pay in medicine - indicates that employers, the UK Health Education Authority and the Ministry of Health seriously wish to implement agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription may reduce the risk of heart attack by 2 pounds per day.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with a dose of 2 pounds a day, as the official representatives recommend that they take more people and longer periods of time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after the heart beat, reducing the risk of repeated heart beats.
NHS-represented NICE recommends that this medicinal product be used 4 years after the heart beat to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE currently in charge of NHS is recommended to use this medicine 4 years after the heart beat to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessels.
About 140,000 people live in England each year, and one quarter of them experience repeated strokes or strokes.
Cardiac stroke and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fats in the heart wall by forming a barrier.
If the barrier breaks, it can cause a thrombosis by blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if the thrombosis is separated from the blood vessels wall, it may go further into the bloodstream and block access to the brain by causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack have been exposed to a higher risk of repeated heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the UK company AstraZeneca and marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombosis.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and 3 more years of 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
NICE Director of Health Technology Professor Carol Longson explains: "Despite the availability of medications for the prevention of recurrent heart beats, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart stroke experience another heart stroke or stroke, often with serious consequences."
Fear of a relapse can have a negative impact on the quality of human life.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurrent heart stroke and heart attack in people who have experienced it once.
By provisionally recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we can extend treatment opportunities to thousands of people who have thus benefited.
Taking into account the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that it be used for longer than this period.
The culture of political justice promotes fraud in Muslim communities during elections
According to the management report, the former mayor of the city of Tauerhamlet, Lutfurs Rahman, was dismissed from office in connection with corruption.
The Government's report reveals that the culture of poly-correction leads to the eyes being drawn to widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Ser Eriks Pikl criticises police, election guards and city councils that they ignore the signs of fraud in the electoral process because "they fear to affect ethnic and religious interests."
The former secretary of the community, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the involvement of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that police should be allowed to station guards at the polling stations to protect the people who are deprived.
He also suggests that voters should present a supporting document when they vote to prove their true identity.
At present, only the name and address of the voter must be indicated.
He even recommends marking the voter’s fingers with a special ink to prevent a double vote.
The rapporteurs must also provide greater protection, says Sir Erik.
He believes that the press should ensure greater access to Council documents and decisions adopted by the informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The aim is not only to prevent the will of fraud, but also to protect the local government from more corruption and the culture of fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was ordered by Dauningstrit after a scandal in connection with the elections of the city of Tauerhamlet.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided to remove mayor Lutfur Rahman from office of mayor for corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman 's religious view of his Muslim community was "skinned down" and hid his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his election campaign by saying that the religious duty of believers is to vote for him."
Some 300 votes were false or questionable, since one person had voted several times.
Sir Erik also points out that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that it is particularly disturbing to vote fraud by post, where the elders of the Muslim communities forced others to vote for themselves.
Sir Erik recommended a number of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a document proving the identity of the person.
His report says: "The evidence shows that members of unprotected ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote for the community's senior elected candidates, especially in Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There are concerns that regional authorities are not paying attention to these problems due to political correctness because they could affect ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Eriks outlined 50 recommendations for improving the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists working with the votes cast by mail to prevent the "collection of votes".
The report by Teresa Meja also calls for a more thorough registration check to prevent the use of voters' lists for immigration and benefits fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to present a document of proof before the vote.
Mark the fingers of voters with special ink to prevent a double vote.
systematically check the nationality of the person to ensure that the person has the right to vote.
Set three-year limitation requests for automatic postal voting.
To prohibit political campaign participants and activists from working with votes cast on postal and electoral ballots.
Ensuring the police the power to assign protection to the polling stations.
To make changes to the law to facilitate the summoning of persons to the responsibility for incarceration under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Forbid photographing in the selection boxes.
Set the requirement to use only English in the ballot boxes (except in Wales).
Strengthen training so as to ensure that voters go to polling stations on a case-by-case basis.
Ser Erik's case criticises the Metropolis police, saying he doesn't understand that the Tauerhamlet case does not contain charges.
He says: "The election court has only disqualified Lufcur Rahman and his representatives for actions related to corruption and fraud."
He was convinced that he was guilty of the standard of proof of criminal law on the basis of irresponsible evidence.
He also criticises the inefficient city council electorate's "cash check" in the electoral registering boxes.
Ser Eriks points out: "The court decision taken last year is a alarm bell.
Our country is known as the birthplace of Parliament, but a disturbing and secret election of the spread of fraud and the establishment of institutions that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.
Stunning with a wheeler - Reitas co-sponsors and other Rio Olympics
The fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics are excited about the French rider Paulin Ferrand Prevot, whom the fans have recognized as extremely similar to the hercogie of Cambridge.
However, the 24 - year - old rider is not the only athlete who fights this summer for gold, which, according to the media, boasts of his fame.
Therefore, for the honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently visible on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic players, which is most similar to the Hollywood stars.

CBC Olympics Commentator apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer has been 'completed like a pig'.
Bairon McDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhas finish fourth place in 4x200 m free-style staff for women, called for a shock wind in CBC viewers.
Canada's channel CBC was forced to apologize because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer from the competition was "flighted out of the competition that he was bleeding alone" and "ended like a pig".
Commenter Bairon Macdonald thought that his microphone was off when 4x200 m free-style staffing women finally set out their personal views.
Macdonald, who was included in CBC's comments team to comment on life, said, "The small 14-year-old from China is unable to keep up with it."
"After she fell asleep, she flew out of the competition, that she just fainted and ended up like a pig."
Thank you very much.
The result of the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana in the second phase was 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of the Canadian Tailor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
The viewers all over Canada reacted immediately on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tone and statements.
Emets Makfarlains posted Twitter: "Did the CBC's direct comment just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "ended like a pig"???".
Idiot did not realize that they were still in the straight line.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m in free-style final women was called "a small 14-year-old from China who doesn't have any. "
Criticism against Bairon Macdonald quickly came into force, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter users could not believe when they heard the insensitive comments of Bairon Macdonalda.
Twitter user Sara Paradi wrote: "Oho, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound racist.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was currently conducting CBC live radio, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying, "We apologize that the comment on the result of swimming was recovered in the direct ether."
It was an unsuccessful choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
MacDonald's colleague, Scott Russell, came to apologize for him.
Then CBC filed an apology for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We are very sorry that such comments were made, and they came to the direct ether.
Yesterday we immediately responded and apologized to all the viewers and followers of social media.
For the sake of clarity, it should be said that Bairon’s comments were made about the performance of the swimmer rather than addressed to her personally.
However, in any case they were unprofessional and unsuccessfully selected statements and Bairon was very sorry for what had happened.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald personally apologized to the direct ether and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be taken as a personal attack.
He said, "I would like to use the moment and apologise for the comment I made yesterday after the women's free-style competition."
I'm talking about the swimmer's performance, not his personal performance.
Many people say that I didn’t mean to show disrespect, and I’m really sorry that it happened.
Primark's buyers are shocked by a woman who unsolicitedly fits into the basement store.
The buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began to dress so as to fit her pants in the middle of the store.
As the situation worsened, she agreed to make sure that they were present to her and then tossed her back into the shop.
She continued to look for clothes at the Folkeston Bouverie Place shopping centre and attended four more bikings.
Primark shop Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkeston – the place where this woman adhered to the underwear and then put it back in her hair.
At the time, two children’s mother, Jenia Davidson, was in the store, who said that an unknown woman had dressed her clothes and abandoned her shop without buying anything.
She points out that people could not believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took off her underpants, pulled off her zechubs and trousers, and measured them on the spot.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place where to measure them, she simply kept them in place.
Everyone looked at her pants and apparently didn’t like them because she just put them back in her hair.
She measured three more pants until she decided that she didn’t like any of them and left the store.
He did not seem to be attracted to someone who looked or thought about the person who would buy the clothes he was wearing.
Davidson's novelist (33 years) from Kent says: "It's funny that someone will buy clothes that have been worn by another person and that are not washed afterwards."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson's novelty adds: "I assume that after her departure the shop staff removed those clothes from the shop's hair - which is also acceptable."
I cannot imagine that I could buy a new underpants and learn that another woman has accepted them and then they are not washed.
The representative of Primark indicated that Primark was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
The specific clothes are removed from the shop’s lungs.
How to Protect Yourself From Guns by Using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves close to the gunmen, we talked to Krav Maga Master of New York, Ron Mizraki.
Whether you attack from the front or the back, this video shows how to protect yourself and get over the attacker.
Misraki indicates that if the attacker is attacked from the back, it is necessary to turn around first to see clearly the attacker and avoid any shooting.
Then the weapon must be held between his front hand and his back and made a seat in the opponent's face with his free elk.
Then the sitting next to the cross and while the attacker is in pain, he must take away his weapon, go on face to face with his weapon back and withdraw, continuing to turn his weapon against him.
If the attacker is approaching from the front, the situation is similar - we must avoid any such trajectory, hold up a weapon and release it in such a way that the wicked cannot shoot.
At the same time, pressure must be exerted on a weapon and a seat must be placed on the enemy’s chests and finally withdraw his weapon and refrain from continuing to discuss it.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how Mizaraki does it.
But remember, if you're not Krav Maga's master, it's safer to hand over your money to the kidnapper.
The hydrogen family demolishes the social home of Saltash Kornvola and is placed on the street.
The hydrogen family has been removed from the neighborhood for terroristisation, causing damage to the social home of 50,000 pounds.
Tanja Skoldona and her partner, Sean Trebilkoks, are only left in the property in Saltask Kornvol, as they have received a number of complaints.
When they were forced out of the property, the shocked representatives of the housing service found that the property was completely demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, and there were waste and the walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now separated from the property and is most likely living in a private property.
Donna Makevova, administrator of the Cornwall House Service, says there is concern that the house will not be able to be restored.
She says that the people who lived here were extremely difficult and that she felt that people could not live there.
In this case, several factors need to be assessed as this property will not have a good reputation in Cornvola.
This family is famous and their name is well - known.
The couple had three sons who were regularly held in possession, and the police said their terror was expressed as violence, street rage with baseball bats, local population involvement, drug use, drug sales, and loud abuse and laziness.
In June, 47 - year - old Sheldon was sentenced to antisocial treatment.
In a number of demolished rooms, the waste is found.
Several floors have also been removed from the house where drugs can be marketed.
Neighbors say that they regularly fought on the street and were always called police.
The Cornwall House Service set them free from property pressure when they were given 11 weeks to leave the house voluntarily.
The missing neighbors were very happy about being left because their lives were absolute.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived with them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because there was so quiet here - we haven't experienced it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatricks, who is the head of the Neighbourhood Protection Service of Cornvola House, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family lived here for 20 years and was regularly called police.
In the grown-up garden, various old and unused items were found.
He also said, "It is very sorry that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because leaving the house is always the last step considered by the Cornvola House Service."
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their neighbors had been very hard looking at their behavior.
I appreciate the work that all my team, Devonas and Cornvola police and members of the Commune, who were courageous and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for our neighbours and show that anti-social behaviour is not acceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons have lived here for various periods of time, but they are all about 20 years old.
A dirty mattress that stayed on the floor in one of the rooms after landing.
Service staff will now have to clean up the waste that has been left at home.
In 2014, the police house was cut down and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon has only been recognised as a class B drug in the storage of drugs for the purpose of their distribution.
She insisted that the money was intended to be a memorial for her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After leaving, it is known that they are now renting private property in Plimut.
There were graphs on many walls.
The police say they'll continue to put down tenants who violate their leases.
The police representative of Devona and Kornvola, Angela Krova, points out that this is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who think they can behave as they want and it will not have any consequences."
Devona and Krovola police are not acceptable criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The willingness to spend can give impetus to the economy.

The cannibals banned burkini swimsuits in the beaches.
The measure of the southern French resort Kannu has prohibited the wearing of burkini swimsuits in this town’s beaches, which almost completely protects the woman’s body and reminds her very much of the hydrowear, local officials announced on Thursday.
Kannu Mayor David Linars has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have swimwear that respects good habits and secularism" as the basic principle of the French Republic.
"Pludmal clothing that exhibits external religious affiliation when France and places of worship are the aim of terrorist attacks may create a risk of public order disturbance (smearing, clashing, etc.) that needs to be avoided," the action said.
"We are talking, not about the prohibition of wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about outer clothing that relates to the faithful movements of terrorists who are fighting with us," explained the head of the municipality's municipal services in Thierí Miguel.
He added that the burkini swim suits have not been seen in the Kannu beaches since 28 July, when the right-wing "Republicans" member Linars signed this order and it came into effect.
This week, in the city of Marseille, the Aquapark abolished planned private measures for Muslim women who would wear burkini in swimsuits, as the link to such a measure was expressed by both the good and the left-wing politicians.
In France it is prohibited to wear head coverings of Muslim women, but no religious symbols or appropriate clothing are prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in Cannam in the nearby resort town of Nice, where the responsibility group "Islamic State" was taken.
On 26 July, two attackers who had sworn allegiance to the State of Islam brutally buried the priests in the church in northwestern France.
"Jishk" last growing turnover by 5%
The retailer SIA Jisk Linnen'n Furniture ("Jishk") raised turnover by 5%, reaching 23.66 million euros, shows company.lv information.
The turnover of the company in 2014 was EUR 22.57 million.
The company's profit also increased slightly - from EUR 781 235 in 2014 to EUR 785 896 last year.
The management report said last year that the company rebuilt the existing store in Riga, Sloka Street and closed the store in Riga, Kurzeme.
This year, like other years, the company's main task is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.
It is still recommended to leave the profits indistinguishable.
Jisk is an international shop network that offers goods for home improvement.
The JIA "Jisch Linnen'n Furniture" was founded in 2001.
The company’s capital is EUR 3 500 264.
The company belongs to a company registered in Iceland "Joska Eignarhaldsfelag ehf av PLC".

The festival "Cubana" began in Lucavsala.
Thursday, August 11, the evening of Lucavsal was given a start to one of the last festivals of this summer - there will be "Cubana" until Sunday night.
In the first evening, groups such as Enter Shikari from Great Britain, which was expected to last but not miss out on the program, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
The next days of the festival also include the words "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", the founder of the Pancroque legend "Romanes" by Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg, "Brutto&Lyapis" by the Belarusian Pancraque leaders in front of Sergei Mihaloc, the popular Georgian actor and singer Wathangs Kikabidze, the Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a number of others, but the full programme of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year when the festival "Cubana" takes place in Latvia.
Yesterday it suffered financial failure and huge losses, but it did not deter the organizers from trying again - they added a long-term mark to the name, included a Latvian group (Friday evening 19:15 on the stage "All Day Long") and announced that the festival now became "closer and gained local color with symbols such as its panoramic and cat".
Whether these efforts will be justified, yet to judge too early, because the festival just fell, but, as Delfi Entertainment observed the first evening, at least temporarily the enormous efforts of people to attract did not succeed and the number of visitors was similar to yesterday.
The British racing team doubles the good Olympic record and wins the championship.
The British troupe team twice repaired the Olympic record on Thursday and won the race for men.
The first Olympic records were well qualified by the British, but in the first place the competition was re-corrected by the New Zealanders.
In the final meeting with the British team with New Zealand, the British withdrew the title of the new-greens owners of the Olympic record, leaving them with silver medals.
The final British team won 42,440 seconds, winning the new greens by 0.102 seconds.
In the fight for bronze, the French team won Australia.
It should be noted that the record was also corrected in the qualification of women's residency - the British team was correcting the world record, which is now 4:13,260.
President who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
On Friday 12 August, 145 years have passed since the birth of the second President of Latvia Gustav Zemgal.
Zemgal announced Latvia's state, but the undeserved has remained in the shadow of the last President of Latvia, Mr. Jārl Ulman, and the last President of the previous period.
None of our national men have defended democracy and justice as well as the Earth, according to Arnold Auziņš in the book dedicated to Gustav Zemgal ten years ago.
In a conversation with the Delfi portal, Auziņš emphasizes that Zemgal is one of the rare high-ranking politicians who have had a sense of humor.
The rest are stiff, always very correct.
He taught not to be, today it might be like Raymond Vionius.
"He was the one who was close to the people," says Auzin.
Today’s politicians have a bad history, they have referred to Carli Ulman as good leaders, but rarely does anyone know how negative he was.
At the government’s meetings, General Balody was the only person he had ever been to.
Even if he was kind and funny, after nature he was hysterical.
"The earth with its sense of humor and democracy leaves a direct opposite impression," Auzins says.
Professor Aivars Stranga of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia in dialogue with Delfi agrees with Auzini's assessment of Zemgal as a peaceful and respected national.
He also notes that Zemgal stood up with respect for minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"It was not customary at the time, after the Zemgal Presidency, Albert Kwiess took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a quiet and considerate man who had long come to speak as president.
He didn't talk about it himself, he just didn't hate fame.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know French, but he felt that the president must understand it.
"At the time of the Presidency, the basis of the French language was learned," explains Stranga.
The land did not allow himself to be re-elected, and he did not care about this very high position.
In any case, he was a very respected person in Latvia's history, already before he was in the presidential palace he was a very demanding notary.
Zemgal also led the famous Zemgalkas in Suvorova Street 3, where a stockholders' and depositors' company was located, in which the government's negotiations became the state of Latvia.
He was always progressive.
He was not a great respecter of Ulmana, but he was not opposed in public.
"In private negotiations, however, it has sometimes been said that Ulman's real actions are not sympathetic to him," says Stranga.
He lived a peaceful life, no doubt about lawlessness or corruption.
How do we remember the Zemgal today?
Unfortunately, for the most part he only associated with some street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, he thought he was central.
"There were no major clashes during her time, that is, he could associate with such a real stable presidency," said Stranga.
During the presidency of Gustava Zemgal, from 1927 to 1930, a visit to Sweden was also made by Latvia, which at the time indirectly meant full recognition in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the family of the democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgal arrived on a national visit to Stockholm.
The Swedish King Gustava V's response was visited in Latvia on 29 June 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871, but he died in January 1939.
Simple ways to help a child deal with anger attacks.
I often have to face the fact that the anger of the child, the parent’s appearance, is considered to be wrong and abnormal.
When the child openly shows his anger - we don't know how to react, "Econet" indicates psychologist Jekaterina Kesa.
The expert encourages a small discussion of these natural and human feelings - anger and tenderness experienced periodically by each one.
Aggression - it is already a physical action directed against other people, and it usually occurs when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, upset - we usually know what's going on with us and how to get through it.
We can express, suppress, hide, keep ourselves, tell about it to our friends or other relatives, we can sell cigarettes, smoke cigarettes (it's not the best way to cool off!), go in the shower, go to the table with bullets and do other things we don't usually do.
We do not turn our aggression against others because we know various other ways to deal with these emotions.
When they are angry, children do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Hey away!", you're dumb, " Bad mom," "I'm not gonna hurt you," "I'm not gonna hurt you" -- and very rarely when you can say, "I'm mad at you."
Children live literally, they are right here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and truly in expressing their feelings, and often they are also in a wide range of emotions.
It is very important that the parents do not prevent the child from expressing their feelings, including anger, anger, resentment, but rather help the child.
Should relationships be broken?
A long working day where everything has not just happened as you would like, or simply a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you would like to "lock off" for a moment, a day or even longer from around the world.
Is it possible to break up relationships at the moment and breathe a little?
However, does this indicate that each of the partners is on their way?
In his views, the gentlemen are divided into different ages.
John (23) is short and nuclear: "In my view, if you need a break, then don't be with the real person."
Edward (30) has discovered a scheme that may help.
If you feel that your partner is starting to fall on your nerves for every minor detail, then it is certainly the right time to examine other hunting fields to see if you miss her or especially about her not thinking about her or even not wanting to see her again.
So the answer is, yes, stopping a break can help you save time and understand how important it is for you to have the other side.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
I think it is important to keep relations together on a daily basis, because if you spend time with people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the sight of every detail that the other person does, and it begins to fall on the nerves.
People start to know each other, especially if you don't talk about anything anymore, just about what you've done by day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I haven’t had a relationship for more than a few months.
If you think for a moment that somewhere else or at others is better - then why has this woman you've been with earned by someone who can think that there's no good enough here and there's paradise fields behind the mountains?
Thinking is just a small task.
If it's not, then it's not.
"I have, so I condemn a little those who don't have," says Edmunds (46).
Karlim (33) is a completely opposite view.
I think we all need a moment for space.
You can't look at each other every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, looking at each other in the eye and saying something about the love that's going on.
Atopecia!
There are so many things - friends, work, ballet.
It's all your time.
Of course, even for a Christian or a wife, however, if both are to maintain a balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can survive to the grave.
That's it and just that.
March (27) says so: "It is difficult to say - whether or not it is necessary, may or may not take a break, but one is clear - to the proposer there is something to the end, something missing."
If this question arises, then it should be assumed that there will be some change in the near future - on the right side or on the wrong side, it depends on itself.
I think as long as you're young and crazy, you still need a break - something all the time, but when everything's still serious and relationships go completely into another phase, there can be no talking about rest.
But you decide to spend all your life together!
"If you can't stand each other now and once in a while need a room, then what will happen when you're pensioners who comment on how long-lasting cats laugh or argue about where the garden needs to be better grounded on the day," explains Christap (19).
All the words have been changed.
With his emotional and emotional personality, Rosenthal was the first to promote the interest of the Latvian people in visual arts.
"In this sense he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain unforgettable for all time," wrote Roman Suta, an elderly Latvian painter Jani Rosental.
Also in 2016, when the old master’s wide retrospective exhibition was discovered in the main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear - Rosenthal is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but from 13 August it is available to visitors and will be held until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art with a wide repertoire in the newly opened Grand Hall of Exhibitions by artist Jani Rosental (1866-1916), which is part of UNESCO's 100th anniversary calendar at the international level.
The retrospective exhibition, which covers more than 150 works, is one of the central events of the Jana Rozental's annual anniversary programme.
The selection of works of art is mostly made up of a collection of Latvian National Museum of Art, which strongly represents the main stages and genres of classical creative activities, the changes in style and the diversity of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from Axel Gallena-Kallela Museum, Writing and Music Museum, Liepaja Museum, Tukuma Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
The presence of photos of the year’s atmosphere revitalizes the presence of images, the mobile app of the exhibition reveals some art works with photographs taken by the artist for the purpose of creation itself with his camera.
On the other hand, the Finnish-Latvia Association "Rozentāls-seura", named after the Latvian classic, also offers the first stop at the Latvian National Museum of Art in Latvia.
A similar exhibition with the contents set out in English, Finnish and Swedish languages will be opened in autumn at the "Virka" gallery in Helsinki.
Mets Leblans is looking forward to the return of the TopGear show.
The director of TopGear's TV broadcasts said that he was looking forward to the return of the car show in the second season, but admitted that he did not know what was expected of him in the future.
In the meantime, nothing officially happens.
"If it does, then BBC will report it," Le Blanks discovered in a conversation with TV critics.
Doubts about "Gaze on the floor!" the future occurred in July when Leblanka's successor, Chris Evans, announced that he would leave the broadcast.
After he left, Evans admitted that Leblans and "Gaze on the floor!" are "as created each other".
Evans' ex-series "Friends" ("Friends") describes the star as "a true and cruel man", thus bridging the flames that both friends have gone through during the filming.
When Leblank asked what he liked most about the show, he replied that traveling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC telechannel reports that the show does not plan to replace Evans at the new 24th season.
Kalviņš: Meldonija could be removed from the list of prohibited substances this year.
It is expected that the message contained in the medicine Mildronate produced in Latvia could already be excluded this year from the list of prohibited substances for sportsmen, the director of the Institute of Organic Synthesis of Latvia, academic Ivars Kalviņš, said on Friday morning.
He told me that he would go to Canada in September to discuss the meldonia issue with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed the hope that Mildronata would be removed from the "black list" this year.
Two bicycles were delivered to the hospital after the crash.
In Sigulda, on the Swiss street, two bicyclemen flocked to the state police for various traumas.
In the case of an accident in 1987 and 1990, men were born who were both transferred to a medical institution.
Also a hard biker in the fall of the Woods.
In 1989 a man was born in 1905, and was brought into medical care.
In 1989 a motorcyclist was born in the town of Dobeles, Naudite, in the town of Naudite.
He's in the hospital, too.
On the last day, 71 road traffic accidents were registered in Latvia in which 16 people were affected.
Sometime it'll get colder and colder.
Even on Friday in Latvia some time is expected to rain and will become even more of a grade colder, the agency LETA learned at the centre of Latvia's Environment, Geology and Meteorology.
It is possible for places to induce a berth.
It is estimated that mostly rains are expected in Kurzeme and in the north of Vidzeme.
The maximum air temperature will only be within +16, +19 degrees.
The day of Riga will pass without falling and mainly the sun will shine.
However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
The U.S. model business has got a perv in his interpretation of the fined photo session and the impatience of the horror film.
In essence, it is very provocative, on the balancing work of extermination and banal vulgarity, in which the borders between the European art house films and the Hollywood genre product are difficult to draw.
The film with Vigo Mortensen highlights the question of whether parents' conceptually chosen lifestyles (environmentalism, vegetarianism, alternative and exclusion from the depth and values of the consumer society) bring blessings or destructiveness to their children.
The idealist of six children after the death of a wife is confronted with questions about the correctness and true values of the elections.
An exciting, life-wise film by Mets Ross this year won the Canna Festival Award for the Director..
Of course, sharks only do this as an attack on the young girls - in the hooks it was a swimmer, in this case - a brave surfer, as illustrated by Bleik Shipley.
The work demanded her considerable wisdom.
This survival solo number can be compared to James Franko's performance show in the 127-hour film and Rayen Reynolds's game in the film "Live."
Perhaps there is also the main role of the artist Mil Kunis, whose transformations from the model of a creative resident and the family value charmer seem to be created only by the completely lost fantasy of Hollywood scriptists.
In Syria, the Islamic state has reached 2,000 civilians.
On Friday, US-supported Kurds and Arab Allies and Observers announced that the terrorist group of Islam's state fighters had been buried in the province of Menbiz, Syria, by about 2000 civilians who were used as a living majority.
"We killed them because, while fleeing to Jerábulus, they took civilians with them," said Kurdu Menbiz, a press representative of the Military Council.
After two months of Kurdish struggles, the Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), supported by the US Kurdish-Arab Alliance in the north of Syria, announced on Friday that Menbiza was exempted from jihadists.
The Islamic state of Menbiži was adopted in 2014.
The QSD already started last week most of the "Islamic State" fighters from Menbiža, but some of them maintained and showed strong resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city, taking the winners with them.
Islamists go to Jerábulus, located at the Turkish border.
Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that "Islamic State" had kidnapped about 2000 people.
SOHR reported that the Islamics had looted the city’s cars, forced people to break into them, and then taken them to Jerábulus.
Islamic country fighters have also committed mass abductions.
In January, more than 400 civilians, including women and children, were slaughtered in the province of Deir ez Zoras in eastern Syria.
Later, about 270 of the beneficiaries were released.
The number of Islamic fighters fleeing Menbiz is unknown.
The media representative of the Kurdish Menbiz military council reported that the QSD was able to save 2500 people who were held hostage by the Islamics in Menbiz.
The information collected by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, have lost their lives in the fight for Menbiži.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.
Koljegova refused to apply to the VID driver's position.
Inga Koljegova, Head of State Environment Service, decided to withdraw his candidacy as Director-General of State Revenue Service (VID), informed the Agency in the Ministry of Finance.
Koljegova points out that the consultation of her candidacy has increased between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are related to the obvious but more frequent, invisible interests and they have no connection with the assessment of my professional abilities.
"It's not acceptable to me, too," he said.
In the event that her candidacy is approved by the government, it is clear that it would not be a convincing vote and would not allow the necessary changes to the VID to be fully worked and implemented, with all government support.
Without it, full work would not be possible, Koljegova concludes.
"Sometimes I have publicly stressed that I do not want to be politically dependent, but the whole process of my candidacy is now too politicised," explains the official.
"Thanks for the trust and support I have shown, it is experience that I appreciate as a benefit," says Reizniece-Ozolai, in Koljegova.
On Wednesday, the unit said that during the meeting with Koljegovu there were "essential contradictions" between the explanations of the candidate and the information available in the public registers on the costs of dividends to the SIA Palloggs, as the decisions of the Palloggs participants' meetings made publicly available provide for no profit to be shared.
Currently, Deputy Director-General Dace Pelė is the Head of the VID.
In Lebanon, the police are involved in the rescue of two young children without supervision, informs the Government of the State Police of the Latgale region.
Information on unsupervised wheelchairs received on Friday at 7 p.m.
They found themselves in Lebanon at the former store building.
Both young girls were immediately handed over to the doctor for help.
In addition, the wheels also left a bag with documents and mobile phones.
During a half - hour period, the Lawyers discovered the possible location of the children’s parents and went on.
When women came to the civilian home, the police found that the woman was asleep because she was in a strong alcohol mood.
After the initial day of the information in the evening of 1992, a woman who was born was living in a congregation where she used alcohol.
As soon as she went home after the meeting, the woman decided to leave the children at the store under unforeseen circumstances.
The police immediately informed the barrister, who would also decide on the children’s next fate.
Riga Freedom has introduced all the recommendations of the UK regarding the Russian island project.
The administration of the Riga Free Port has implemented all of the five recommendations of State Control (UK) on the development of the project Infrastructure for the transfer of port activities from the city centre to the Russian island, the portal Dina.lv informed the company.
The approval of the project is planned at the closest meeting of the Riga Freeport Board.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the opinion of the VK, the Riga Freedom Management also followed the conclusions of the legal and operational audit conducted by the International Auditor Deloitte Riga Free Station and the recommendations made to improve project management at the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the UK today.
Despite the fact that the administration of the Riga Freeport does not agree with the opinion prepared by the UK on the feasibility of implementing the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the European Commission (EC) funding provider.
I would like to stress that all the planned constructions within the project are fully completed within the time limits set and the planned amount.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the UK, and also to the supporters that the main objective of the free port is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the UK regarding project management and monitoring issues," says the Russian project manager Sanita Kaire.
The existing long-term action plan for the control and monitoring of the objective of the project was complemented by the key planned actions of the stakeholders and the necessary decision-making deadlines, meeting and regular reporting definitions and their deadlines, the monitoring instruments of the planned construction process and the most important border points definitions.
The approved action plan to achieve the project's objective by 31 December 2018, as recommended by the UK, has been complemented by enforcement monitoring activities, thus strengthening the control of the time-limits of other parties involved in the project's implementation from the free port of Riga.
A project management plan has been redesigned for the development of project management and for the reduction of potential risks by defining project management areas and specifying the documents developed to ensure a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
A project management structure scheme has been developed to enhance the project’s capacity, reflecting the structure of the planned project management team, the qualifications and functions of the staff.
In order to improve the communication between the Riga Free Port and the parties involved in the project, a communication plan has been developed for stakeholders, which defines the principles, types and periodicity of the project in addition to those laid down in the project action plan.
On the other hand, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, further details will need to be based on the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the start of procurement, and on the rule of law.
As part of the project, the Russian island has built a global port infrastructure that meets the requirements of four new deep-water terminals, rail ports and engineering communications.
The co-financed projects of the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of the past year, with a savings of EUR 10.6 million.
Threats have led to increased safety at airports in Slovakia.
After receiving non-specific threats, Slovakia stepped up security measures at several airports on Friday, the Ministry of the Interior announced.
"In view of the threats, we have reinforced security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Kosicé," the AFP told the news agency on Friday, a representative of the Slovak Ministry of Interior.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received," he added.
An informal European Union (EU) summit will take place in the capital of Slovakia on 16 September, which will include all the countries of the bloc, with the exception of the United Kingdom.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the British Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia is the EU Presidency by January.
German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of people killed at the Communists' jugs could have been much higher than previously considered, but doubts about the true number of victims have not yet been resolved.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, at the border with westernly populated areas and later by the authorities of the West German Communists, 1841 people who tried to get out of their controlled territory were killed.
The museum's border-related deaths have been researching for years, and the number of victims has been adjusted every moment.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including among the victims including some six-year-old boys who die trying to reach the family through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the young victims of the Berlin Wall are the Soviet army deserters.
"The extent of the damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," admits museum director Aleksandra Hildebrande.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of people who have died trying to escape from a Communist-controlled state are maintained and not lost," stressed Hildebrande's widely circulated statement.
However, other researchers have questioned the new figures.
"The number 1841 is uncertain", in an interview with the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, Berlin Free University of Berlin, expert in Eastern history Johans Stats.
He, along with other researchers at the Free University of Berlin, is currently reviewing possible suspected death cases at the border, and so far only 260 cases have been approved.
The researchers previously estimated that only 138 people were killed by the Communists of the Berlin Wall.
In view of the people who have died, trying to escape the Baltic Sea or enter the West through the neighbouring territories, according to the State, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, it is significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide of the Eastern border guards regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not directly related to violence.
"If older people between the ages of 70 and 80 years after falling into border control mira from the heart stroke, it must have the consequences of this "dream border", Hildebrande.
However, the State is convinced that there is a need to make a distinction between the elderly people who may have died as a result of their anticipated siege and those who have caused long-term waiting on a hot bus at the border.
Regardless of its victims' record, it is not easy because the Communist authorities of Eastern Germany have not collected such statistics, and researchers are required to select documents in various scattered archives, the State states.
However, the State party has recently produced new documents and could therefore be presented in the near future with a new estimate of the number of victims.
LPF President Pone to Rio is accredited by coach; this is a surprise.
In recent days, the president of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) has won a peaceful reputation in the Olympic Games, Kaspars Pone Riodezaneiro.
On Wednesday, a wide variety of axiography was triggered by the words of coach German Jakubovska, an Olympic swimmer Alonas Ribakova, who discovered that at the last moment he decided to go to Pone while the coach had to stay at home.
Initially, allison Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coach Jakubovskis and Dev Collins, as well as the president of the federation, were approved.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied to the Olympics for five participants, and before leaving Aldon Vrubljevskis claimed that Germany would be looking for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons, he was not," said Mr, expressing the view that it did not affect the outcome of Ribakov.
At the request of the federation, Uvja’s coach agreed to help her.
Mr., who is himself a member of the LOK Executive Committee, was probably criticising the operation of the LOK by bringing guilt to the Olympic sports monitoring organisation.
In my view, it is not ethical in the LOC Executive Committee to approve five persons and not to take any of them.
"I don't know why just enough seats were needed for the Swimming Federation," Mr. said that the work of the Federation and its presidents was not evaluated in society, recalling that the presidents of the Federation are not getting wages.
Pone also criticised Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympics when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained at the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
Mr. could not tell why he was in the Olympics with a coach's accreditation, which he probably needed to access Jakubovski.
"I was applied as the president of the federation ("team leader") but for unknown reasons, I received a coach's accreditation and now I'm nowhere inside."
The situation changed every day, the number of credits available changed.
Until the last moment, I think German will be because I didn't have any other information.
Following the information available to LETA, a few days before Ribakova started her eye-to-eye conversation with Poni and after her swimmer was in tears, the president of LPF himself said it was a daily conversation with the desire to entertain athletes before the start.
He recalled that LPF monitors five sports types in the Olympic programme, and four of them also train children in Latvia.
The president of the Federation said that it is also very important in Latvia for the suppression of such programmes and that he has also spoken of Riodjeneiro for almost two weeks.
He celebrated the Federation's work and said that in 2018 Latvia could handle the World Cup stage.
Finding Riodežanier is not my vacation, here I work, spend my time and try to implement four-year programmes.
In Davava, 600,000 salmon will be introduced.
During the renewal programme for the AS Latvenergo fish resources in Daugava this week, the introduction of salmon and tuna in the island of Mangalus is taking place and this year it is planned to launch more than 600,000 single-year salmon and tuna in the fisheries sector of Bior Tomes and Doles.
Latvenergo Agency LETA informed that the introduction of fish will continue in the coming months - 6 300 000 different species of small fish and poultry are introduced in the Daugava basin.
In the spring and early summer 2016 there will be the launch of liquefied and nestled cranes, in June - sieves, in July - spring salmon, in August and September - brandati and vimbas.
The director of Latvenergo’s production, Māris Kunjickis, told that the environmental concerns are one of the cornerstones of the Latvian Group’s sustainable development.
"In the protection and reproduction of fish resources, any action is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both by raising and introducing fish young fish in the Daugava pool and by carrying out other activities," Kunickis said.
This year, more than 600,000 single - year salmon and tuna will be released.
For the second year, small fish are marked before ingestion by cutting fat.
Today's cargo contains 25 000 salmon with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, the introduction of small fish and capores into the waters of Daugav shall take place in scientificly justified species and in digital quantities in Daugav.
The reproduction of fish resources in Daugava and its pools in accordance with the legislative acts shall be carried out by Bior on the basis of an expert on the loss of fish resources caused by the economic activity of Latvenergo and the conclusion that compensation measures are to be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
On the basis of that expertise, the State Environment Service shall, on its own initiative, decide on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual amount of compensation for Latvenergo in the fisheries resource recovery programme is EUR 1,035 000.
In the spring of 2016 Latvenergo, in cooperation with the company "We Fish" is located 400 artificial fish nursing nests in Daugav near Kaibala and Ikškóiles.
Cooperation with the company through the promotion of fish nursing is also supported by Latvenergo in the framework of the fisheries resource recovery programme.
The placement of artificial noodles in the reservoir is an important measure to promote the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugav.
The festival "Sansusi Concerts" is a park, forest, circus.
Sleeping in the tent, eating like a restaurant, walking around in a cage and listening to the captured chamber music, enjoying the quiet nature of the tent, such a combination offers an alternative chamber music festival in Sansus, which already invites to the Aknište novad on the third summer.
The festival will take place in Susai - no longer an existing village - in the former parish courtyard, next to forests and meadows.
In three days - from August 12th to 14th - five views can combine the exquisite delights of carelessness in nature and academic music.
Here with music comes the theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest expressions, find new audiences in a free and open environment without concerts.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to smile on the face and light feet only a few minutes.
"Please do not look for a program because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the real taste of Sansusi can only be perceived by spending all three days in it," invites the festival promoter and owner, operabariton Armands Siņš.
The festival doors are open on Friday at 5 p.m. and the first concert is at 7 p.m.
Of course, there will be programmes on the ground with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend a Saturday, because it is the most satisfied - from 9 a.m. to the next morning.
"The names of artists are available at www.sansius.lv", says Armands Silišn.
In the beautiful bouquet of artists are e.g. Vijolniece Eva Bindere, the violinist Kristíne Blaumane, the starring Inga Mountain, the clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, the trumpeter Janis Poreitis, the pianist Reinis Ziriņš, the quartets Quadra and RIX and even the Estonian air acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Ericus Kiršfeld, Martinus Zilbert and actress Anci Strazdu created a contemporary circus performance Confines for the inner struggle of the artist.
New work has also become a special feature for the festival.
In the exhibition for children "Kukunais", which was composed by Oljesja Kozlovska and Jäkabs Nimanis, according to F. Kafkas, an entomologist (student researcher) Ugis Peterān will participate in Armandus Silinius, musicians and actors.
Oscar Herliņš held the first Stylish Quartet, while Anna Čirse - Wood opera, whose main heroes in Andra Kalnozola's reign with Katrina Neiburg's video projections and Andra Egliš's script will be wooden in three small canisters in three hectares in a large quay.
Singing in the voices of Laimas Icedīnes, Dinar Rudānes and Zigmar Gras, they will come into romantic relations, just like the Swedish naturalist in the study of the Woods marriage (1729).
Riodežaneiro's Olympics are starting today one of the biggest hopes of the Latvian delegation, the seventh athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidina.
Ikauniece-Admidinas at 15.35 after the time of Latvia will begin the race in the 100-metre barrier, but at 16.50 a.m. the game is expected to rise.
On the other hand, it is already night on Saturday at 2.35 p.m. that the ball will start working until 4.05 p.m. - 200 m. sprint.
Seventy-six competitions will be concluded on Saturday when the distance, the break and the 800 meters running will take place.
Prior to the Olympic Games, Ikauniece-Admidina, who was awarded the bronze championship last year, was referred to as an Olympic medal candidate.
In May, Latvia set up a new national record (points 6622) and won second place in the prestigious seven-star competitions in the city of Gecis in Austria.
Ikauniece-Admidina also participated in the 2012 London Olympics when she won the ninth place with a re-recorded Latvian record.
During the last half of the year, the athlete has improved national records four times.
Today at 16 p.m. the start is also planned for Latvian judo cikhstóm Artūrum Nikiforenko, who starts in the weight category over 100 kg, in the first place with Azerbaijani athlete Ushangi Kukauri.
Judith will be the first Olympic career.
LETA has already reported that a loss of up to 100 kilograms on Thursday in its first fight was experienced by the Latvian judo cíktoni Jevgenij Borodavko.
He joined the Japanese Hagu Rjunoski, who later obtained a bronze.
In 2000 Vsevolod Zelonius brought the honour of the Olympic Bronze to Latvia, but in the next four Olympic games, Latvian judicatures won only one victory together in seven struggles, which was won directly by Borodavko in London.
Plkst.16.30 After the competition for Latvia's time, Dainis Uppelnieks will start shooting, but the selection will end on Saturday.
On the day of the official announcement of the composition of the Latvian delegation, the uplers received the Olympic landmark, but later he revealed to the agency LETA that it was quite safe to travel since April.
At the venue of the Olympics, the athlete will appear as one of Latvia's first athletes, trying to make maximum use of the opportunity to compete in the shooting.
Plkst.19.05 After the final three trips to Latvia, the 17-year-old winner of the Olympics will be the Latvian sailor Ketija Birzule, who competes for sailors in the RS:X class.
After three days or nine trips in the Birzule pool among 26 athletes are currently in the 25th place.
On the other hand, there will be a crucial final journey on the medals on Saturday.
Today, it is also planned to take part in the academic airing where the Latvian representative of Ireland is required to participate in the competition for Sanita Pušpuri.
On Wednesday, the competition was cancelled because of adverse weather conditions.
Pušpure will be awarded at 19.10 p.m. in the C/D semi-final for women only, fighting for the 13th place in the Olympics.
On Tuesday, a quarter of the final ride, she fought for the fourth place, from the third position, which would allow the fight for the medal to continue, leaving for 0.65 seconds.
Pušpure had won the 13th place in London four years ago, when he also represented Ireland.
Today, 24 medal sets will be divided into Olympics – round shooting, easy-to-playing, reeling, needing, paving, tramplining, judo, academic flying, shooting, swimming, tennis and weighting.
Reid claims if Clinton will be elected President, then he will appoint Garland as Judge of the Supreme Court .
The leader of the Senate Democratic Party, Harry Reid, is confident that if she becomes president, she will appoint Mr. Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court .
The Senate Republican Party has blocked Garland's approval since March when President Obama appointed him.
The Senate's majority leader, Michs Maconnells, announced that the next president would be elected to replace the current Supreme Court judge, Antonino Skalius.
On Thursday during his conference, Reids announced that he was convinced that Clinton would choose Garland.
The representative of Reida later told us that he had not personally talked about this subject with Clinton and that they are merely speculations.
He celebrated Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want to "buy the ship" with another choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. District Court of Appeal.
Reid said that the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "problems" and act in the interests of the President of the Republican Party of Donald Tramp.
He also said that Trump was not fit for the work of the President.
The Treaty shall be notified of the caliphto calendar to women and men.
The magazine Treats will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 Pirelli calendar in the style of the 70th century.
In its 2017 UN Museum calendar, it is planned to demonstrate the new supermodels, not the kale celebrations.
At the beginning of this year, Treats president Steve Shaw announced that his erotic art magazine was different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a man's magazine".
This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's talking about a calendar, too.
The press release on the creation of a calendar tells us: "We must return to the imagery of the unfathomable and classical chalice where the woman's body does not mutilate, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great art work.
Models can send their photos electronically or personally to casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland shark is the easiest to live backbone - video view
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks have the greatest life ever on our planet.
The shark researcher Julius Nielsen tells us that the record of longevity belongs to a mother who could be 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
The French court rejects the claim to destroy shops in the jungle refugee camp.
The French court rejected the demand of the institutions to destroy dozens of self-constructed shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the hearing this week in Kale, the authorities indicated that the country should destroy 72 self-constructed shops where people market various goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some Euro-constructed restaurants.
The Prefect’s Office pointed out that these self-constructed companies must be replaced because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as pose a risk to fire and sanitation.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small companies are important because the food provided by government and support groups does not provide the needs of the camp where the population continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free meals and food to those who need it most.
The small court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel people who created 72 self-constructed shops, but it understood the prefect’s concerns in Kale.
Judge Jean-Français Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a more important role than simply providing food for people living in "extremely unscrupulous conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of destruction is the Jungle Book Kids camp, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French language activities and provides advice on asylum issues to hundreds of unprotected minors without adult involvement.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition for child coffee.
The Guardian's letter states that the disposal of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charitable organisations "Helping refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" reported that the number of inhabitants of the "Junglju" camp has increased to 9000 people, the highest since the rapid arrival of migrants in the summer.
Britain is gaining silver Regbie-7 in a series of struggles when Fiji’s national unit is mastering gold.
The impressive performance of the UK selection of Regbie-7 series ended on Thursday, when the Rio Fiji National Unit was convinced that they were buried with the result 43:7 at the exciting final stage of Deodoro.
Fiji demonstrated masterminds in the management of the bomb, the play of the bomb with legs, support in the game and the brutal force in the battle of gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
Sakav brought a prize of respectable satisfaction - a silver medal that was then the third medal in Britain. The UK selection can boast of its achievements in the first Olympic Regbie-7 tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The heavy fighting half-final, where the Boks team was hit by the match at 7:5 in the first half of the day, may have been played to the United Kingdom at the end.
But in any case Fiji's selection is now in its best form to also win the 15 men's team.
Although unlikely, a well-known consolation for Britain could have been the fact that at least one British won a gold medal. It is Fiji’s leading coach Ben Ryans – former English coach from Vimbledon.
Britain had an exciting experience.
Eight years ago, under Raine's leadership, they lost all the game regbie-7 in the Adelaide series.
This time they lost only one game.
Swelling is painful, but growth is surprising.
Fiji was impressed by the release of the British forces.
Captain Tom Mitchell and the members of the team were as a meeting with a number of bus rides and World Series champions took the lead at 5:0 when Ocean Kolinisau won the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai has also increased the prevalence of malnutrition in the right wing.
Result 12:0 and the British team had not even really touched the bomb.
Mitchell's great power method did not allow characteristic Leon Nakarava to get three points, but it only slightly affected Fiji's performance.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua won a landing at the right corner, strengthening the superiority over Britain until 17:0.
After the victory, Nakarava gained even more prominence and had remained more than a minute... at the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravovou avoided some unusual British power practices and crossed the line by winning points.
The landing provided the result 29:0.
The rest that Fiji was born to play regbie-7 in cats while the British were just learning.
In fact, that is also true.
The British team made major changes in half-time, crossing Fiji's line of players... full four minutes, which after the first half-time standards was good until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team match, gained some more points on Fiji's team's right.
Den Norton managed to score points for the British team by landing at the left corner and achieving score 36:7, but the game had already been lost, while the fans of the South Sea saloons sang, cheered the flags and danced in the Tribes.
It is not surprising that Fiji has a life - threatening attitude.
Mata Viliame made Fiji a more sweet victory with another landing at the end of the game.
By discovering the games at the end of the swing, Fiji could begin to celebrate, but the British only after the crash was able to sit in the room.
On the first half of the day, the semi-final Fiji won Japan with the result of 20:5, whereas the British were too much than South Africa, where in a very tough fight both teams won by subterfuge and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half of the day, Kyle Brown was led by Boks, but in the second half, Den Norton crossed the line with a brilliant skill and delivered a bomb between the poles, providing British victory.
Markus Vatson, who is the brother of Antony the 15th English team player, provided the team with a win and another silver medal at the end of the game.
Trainer's fight against cancer inspired Helen Glovier and Heteri Staning to win the flying game.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last vision, the golden mill of Helena Gloves and Heteres Staning was of particular importance on the route of Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there are only two athletes on board, she was accompanied by Robin Williams' support, which inspired her to the second Olympic gold medal for women in the flying pair, becoming the first women in the history of British sports, which has achieved such success.
She was no doubt dominated by the 39th time she won an unprecedented, unprecedented victory.
Both great athletes with floor elegance sliding across the water surface do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind each gold medal, there is a whole team that works hard to keep athletes continuously improving their performance and making the biggest contribution to their success by a coach who did not know or will experience this day as he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it turned out.
I had urinary bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated on, and it also happened.
If I didn't, it would spread all over the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes your vision a little.
Vulnerable cancer was discovered in December 2013.
This resulted in William being able to initiate the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 interim season and to reduce the duration of the interruption to a minimum if possible.
I needed income, so I needed to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital, and I took 6, 10 and even 15 meters long, although the doctor said that I would take a few steps.
It all started.
Driving itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought immediately came to mind about Williams, who was very concerned all morning and spoke more than usual about the excitement.
Staninga, who served at the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said, "This was an emotionally serious week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much that means to us and how much Helen and Robin have worked.
Helen and Robin, who have been married for three years, have been great.
Without Robin we wouldn't have achieved anything, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better coach or a better coach.
Helena Glovere and Hetre Staning have not lost in any race for five years.
The pair achieves such a huge speed that a competitor cannot compete with.
Even the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to get closer, Staning and Gloves were too large.
We felt every moment.
Helen sang, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose concentration.
We had a good start, but at the same time we did not have high hopes.
On that day, we did not aim to cast the records, but we simply flew well and won the matches, and we did.
A few years will rest to decide what to do next.
The following month will be the marriage of the Seeker, Steve Bashal, of Gloves and Television Adventures.
In the meantime, she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn't mean to say that this was my last game.
It would have been too much pressure.
I needed about six months in London to understand that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience, and I was very excited.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "It feels great."

Kołegovu VID Head of the VID "to the last".
According to him, now Prime Minister Māris Kučinski (Green and Agricultural Union) and Minister of Finance Dani Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Agricultural Union) are already "primarily important" for the approval of candidates headed by the Minister of Finance to be the head of the VID.
Rajevskis estimated that both Kučinski and Reizniece-Ozoli were the "first major decision" of the VID leader in this government, which could affect him as a political future.
If the position of the VID leader is now changing in the selection of the candidate, it will have a negative impact on the management of their imagery.
The next week's agenda of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the question of the transfer of the Head of the VID Koļegova to the office of Director-General of the VID, as indicated by the Government's agenda.
Mr Reizniece-Ozola, Minister of Finance, headed for Koljegovov VID, after he resigned from the management of the service in Ināra Peterson and the competition for the post of Director-General of the VID ended with no results.
On Thursday, 11 August, in an interview with the CEO of the VID, Dace Pelėk allowed the Latvian Radio - if she offered to run for the manager's office, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance, however, later acknowledged that there are no other candidates for the VID leader's office.
The Head of the Saeima Group of the National Association also acknowledged that the NA still supports the management of the Kołegovu VID.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit threatens the failure to create a government.
On 12 July the European Commission (EC) delivered its opinion that Spain and Portugal had not implemented sufficient measures to reduce the deficit to 3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
The calculations show that despite the savings measures implemented, the Portugal budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP, while Spain was 5.1%.
However, the European Commission has decided not to apply economic sanctions to both countries, while at the same time setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions on the two countries concerned, however, is the increasing European skepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such a negative trend.
Critics point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions from the beginning with the agreement on common rules and then unable to apply them in life.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, pointed out that Europe thus loses confidence in itself, creating an idea for citizens that the European Union rules are recommendable, not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved to extend the budgetary deficit settlement period until the end of this year for Portugal and Spain by 2018.
The European Commission promises to examine the progress made by both countries in the coming months, at the same time pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional savings measures if conditions so require.
The initial forecasts show that Portugal's target could be achieved at a certain time and already this year the budget deficit could fall to 2.5% of the domestic total.
This means that within the framework of the Stability Programme, this country's government needs to implement savings measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget by paying further attention to the control of the cost of purchases of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, consolidation measures should amount to 0.5% of GDP annually over the next two years.
The particularly difficult achievement of these objectives is the fact that, for eight months, the Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the establishment of a government, and the possibility for Spain to come to an early parliamentary elections is growing.
However, public opinion polls show that the political landscape of the third election would not change significantly.
The most popular party is still the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoj, of the nation's leading party, whose will would regain a 33% vote.
Its popularity has increased slightly only by socialists, while the popularity of the "Podemos" or "We Can Together" and "Citizens" or "Citizens" against economic measures has decreased slightly.
The People's Party wants to achieve socialist and citizen involvement in the government this month, otherwise it will not be able to accept and submit a draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission by mid-October.
As the representative of the People's Party's parliamentary group, Rafael Hernando, has announced, if the government fails and Parliament's elections will be held for the third time, Spain will become a whole of Europe's laughingstock.
The purity of beaches in the Riga Sea is critical.
In the fifth year of surveying the beaches, activists concluded that unfortunately every year the number of found wastes is increasing, and most of the visitors are guilty here.
The most contaminated bathing places are in Riga.
In the matter of the capital, it is clear that bathing places are difficult to fight against unclean visitors every day.
In addition, waste left on land can be disposed of in water during rainy season, thereby significantly improving its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beaches and certain locations in Kurzeme, the purity of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a statement has been circulated this week by the volunteers of the campaign "My Sea".
In the fifth year of measuring the road along the Riga Sea, activists concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every 100 metres.
Unfortunately, this year this criticism has fallen.
"We see that this will be a year when the number of waste on the beach is perhaps over 200 units," says the representative of the expedition "My Sea" Jānis Ulme.
The Latvian Radio was called, he was located on the Tuja beach where he will continue his voluntary walk along the Riga Sea.
This year, even day - to - day lights left in the sea are collected between the various household wastes and the picnics.
The transition participant and organizer Ulme say that pollution is directly responsible for the population.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, as more than half of the total waste is plastic, different waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already in the decay stage, they can no longer be identified and smoked, bottles, corks," Ulme says.
Among the cleanest beaches there are also bathing places in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgriva, on average, nearly 800 waste units are collected every 100 metres, which are critical.
The organizers of the campaign also explain that every step of the program also involves smoking and not all signs of warning or ban.
"The average of all three Riga bathing places together - Daugavgrīg, Vakarbulīs and Vecáčís - unfortunately is large and far beyond the desired target, which, like Latvia, has been moving to, by 2020, reduce the number of waste units to 135 units", concludes the environmental defender.
The cleaning of bathing places in Riga takes place every day, on the hottest days of summer even twice, explains the representative of the council Ugis Vidauskis.
However, fighting against unclean visitors is very difficult.
We are going back to these people's cultural issues.
"For those who mix, use alcohol, smoke and do all the things that must not, even special signs, not work," says Vidauskis.
Vidauskis therefore invites visitors to swim to report pollutants to the police as well.
It can be called a police force, certainly pointing to these violations and thus fighting everyone.
It may be possible to impose new warnings, but as I said, it is almost or will change the situation radically.
"Since everyone must simply turn around and be impatient with such offenders together," he stressed.
Water quality measurements have been carried out this summer for the fourth time by a health inspection which may set a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as in other years, the quality of water is always good and satisfying.
The current situation is that the quality of water in all 56 bathing places has always been good and there is no restriction on bathing.
"The last time we're going to have an analysis at the end of August," says the senior environmental specialist Normand Kadíķis.
Waste left on the ground during heavy rains may be disposed of in water.
This may, in turn, affect its quality, the environmental specialist indicates.
The rotations in the Russian elite will continue - the change of leadership in Putin administration.
You're leaving the house?
Vladimir Putins announced to the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov had left this post and will continue to be the president's special representative on the issues of nature protection, ecology and transport.
In announcing the changes, Putins addressed Ivanova in front of the television camera with the words: "Dear Sergei Borisovic, we have worked with you for many years and we do it successfully."
I am pleased with how you fulfill your duties entrusted to you.
I would like to recall our agreement without using you as the head of this President's administration for more than four years.
That is why I will deal with your desire to change the field of activity with understanding.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new office.
However, it is pointed out that the leadership of the President's administration is a very important role and made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Given that the elections of the National Council are to be held in Russia next month, there have been rumors that this step is linked to the fight for power in Russia's political elite.
Ivanov was also called the potential Vice-President of Putina, and the claim that he himself wanted to take over the role of the President's representative in the field of nature protection and transport created doubts.
According to the Lsm.lv archive, Ivanov is the Chief of Staff of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov was a sensible and close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his expeditions in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
In turn, the first Russian President, Boris Jelcina, was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council at the end of his term of office.
In 2000, after Putin's coming to power, Ivanova's "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, including the recovery of national censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001 Sergey Ivanov became the Russian Defence Minister, but in 2005 he was the Deputy Prime Minister of Mihaila Fradkova and was responsible for the development and export of Russian defence companies.
Now, following the resignation of the President's Head of Administration, Ivanov will also remain in the Russian National Security Council, where the new President's Head of Administration will also work.
Guilty comes from family councils in the elite.
Ivanov, himself, has been recommended as Head of the President's Administration.
Anton Eduardovič and I have been known for years.
Even from the time we worked in your government.
And for the last almost five years, we've been communicating practically every day.
"That is why I am convinced that, according to all professional and personal characteristics, he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
Guilt comes from a family belonging to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather, Karl, took high office in the Communist Party of Estonia, including his first secretary for ten years until 1988.
Internet edition "Meduza" with reference to the book "Self-determination and Independence of Estonia" writes that at the end of the 1980s Karl Vaino was asked to allow Moscow to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was rejected and soon lost his job.
Shortly after that, Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from Moscow International Relations Institute and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the management of the President's protocol.
It has already been reported that in recent weeks Russia has been disrupted by the removal of several high-ranking officials and even arrests, including replaced governors and federal representatives of several areas.
As politicians say, President Vladimir Putin is redesigning the ruling elite before the 2018 elections.
One of the main features - more and more representatives of the force structures are increasingly involved in the leading roles.
Nikiforenko is also killed in the first match of the Olympics.
This was the first round of the fight, and Latvia's jogging champion has closed his participation in the Olympics at the end of the 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskin admitted to Latvian television that the hope of Nikiforenko was very low, and it was already clear before the competition.
He also discovered that a jogging bat in the fight won a shoulder injury.
Significantly, to get to the Olympic landmark, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than experienced - i.e. in a weight category of up to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaijan’s mercury was more than 20 pounds [25 kg].
It has already been reported that Jevgenijs Borodavko, in the category of weight up to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki, was held for two minutes until the opponent was awarded a prize of pure victory.
Consequently, the Rio Jujudo competition has ended.
Dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
Thursday was introduced by Jewish Jewess Jevgenius Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more ambitious opponent than he had, but at times ambitiously he was able to bring a surprise.
He didn't.
The task of artura Nicosia was even more difficult, as the experience was less and the opponent was also respectful.
The result is similar, although he held tea on his dad for half a minute longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, Latvia's Jewish people have been missing the most in recent times.
Since the federation's leadership, Gunar Okbers and his financial stand Vladimir Šestakovs, Aleksandr Jackevičs from Latvia, no longer takes place "Golden Score", - the judo development of the downward curve.
Jackevich, who consults with Kazakhstani juditus, and Vsevold Zeloni does not see the heirs.
But if he doesn't grow up, he won't.
And it's the Federation's prerogative.
Therefore, as from another galaxy "Rita panoramic" the promise of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation to throw off the medals was being staged.
Flight away from reality.
In the evening, we were anxious and anxious about the beach volleyball cat Samoilovs/ Šmēdīņš - Evandra/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as already in the "death" group - the losers have finished the game.
The Latvian duet had a slight derogation - it could also lose, but not more than four points in two sets.
The tension was still growing in the past game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling above the wind-card worm all over the sword.
To the players, the brilliance wind caused additional difficulties.
At first it seemed that it might be our best friend.
But he didn't.
Against the Latvian duet playing here was quite simple.
They serve so much for Samuel and wait for him to break.
It was against Canada, it was against Cuba at the end of the first set and at the beginning of the third, because the load was not a joke.
The feast could have been fished at that time, for the work was small, but when it was, it was done with honor.
Brazil's Samilov and Shmédin could win in two sets, because the first was led by 16:15, but on 16 it was also left to swallow the lost point.
But he could also lose with 0:2, because in the second set the deficit was -4, however, also thanks to the wind, managed to win.
The third one has already left the mark of Evandra's servants.
The chain was formed - an inconclusively accepted servant, the second link often flew too close to the network and Samilova remained quite a few options for a successful attack.
If there was an alien Samoilov against the Cubans, this time he worked more successfully, and only on Sasha's loss would be unprofessional.
And Kreely was wrong, and quite symbolically, that last bomb block hit him.
They're losing the team.
This time definitely also failed - in the third set only two Evandra attacks almost flew out of the card, but the bomb still hits the line.
Two steps were next to the line.
The controversial episode also contributed to the benefit of opposers.
If, in the first two games, Evandra taught with servers, they were very productive against us.
All of them were in total loss on the table.
The causes of failure must now be carefully analysed.
Perhaps it was like living next to the stadium, not with the delegation to the Olympic village.
It's been two and a half hours on the way.
A little bit of self-confidence was given in a series of seven semi-finals.
Maybe Klagenfurt shouldn't have played, but get here faster and better acclimatize.
Perhaps there was a mistake in finding the surface of a sports form.
Let's wait for more than an answer.
Our scary games are over.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments left and also Jūrmala's Masters.
Samilo’s meal has never been with friends, and it will not be because there are too many different personalities.
But that's not necessary either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals is broken, it can also be thought of separation, because guilt will be sought not only by itself but also by a partner.
It is not difficult to resolve, but much more difficult in Latvia will be to find a decent partner.
Both brothers are playing the game with fear, but John and Tom have already tried and split up, while Michael Samilov is still too green to start loading the world’s surfaces.
You can try Harald Regž, Aleksandra Solovej, Edgar Toču, to return to Martin Płaviņa, but it will not be better than this option, which has not only confirmed itself in the stages of the World Cup.
They were not mocked this time by the snow of Kopacaba.
A certain one.
Of course, it must also be taken into account that the beach volleyball becomes more popular, new pairs come in circulation, and only rare growth is less than two meters away.
This is not yet a success, but there is an important argument in the fight for victory.
We don't stay longer.
Both sportsmen and journalists have the opportunity to relax in the places offered by game organizers as well as to choose their own.
A selection of US basketball lives on a cruise ship, a part of the tennis player does not stay in the Olympic village.
Some of the beach volleyballists have also found a hotel in Kopacaba.
This time, highly overplayed prices were demanded for journalists for all wealthy overnight accommodation.
Therefore, the choice also fell on the rent of the apartment.
The risk is because sometimes they may be uncomfortable from the point of view of logistics.
This time the risk is justified.
Along with Vladimir Vladimirovich we rent apartments on the border of Kopacabana and Ipanema.
The beach is 200 metres away, and the arena is half an hour away.
The area is pretty safe because the favelas are lying, but wisdom must not be lost here.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some people think about right now, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It seems that another dream of medals was dreamed on Friday morning.
In the 100-metre barrier and lift, Laura Ikauniece-Admidina withdrew from her personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After a 10-year break "Porgy and Besa" scan in Liepaja.
In Latvia, opera "Porgis and Besa" was first studied in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been brought back.
That is why the organizers of Cēsu Art Festival and Liepaja Art Forum decided in close cooperation to provide listeners with the opportunity to enjoy George Görsvina’s masterpiece.
"We are delighted that after a ten-year break when the last time Liepaja was able to enjoy the opera study, this great version of George Görsvina's concert studio "Porgis and Besa" is enjoyed by us in the new, new-opened concert hall "The Great Dintar"", says the concert hall of the Great Dintar, the head of Baiba God.
Opera "Porgis and Besa" is a story told in the bright musical language about love, its impatience, jealousy, as well as domestic tragedies and simple everyday pleasures.
It reflects African American vitality, music and rhythm.
That's exactly this lack of political correction in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so vivid.
"And yes, this lover is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," says director Viesturs Kairis.
What I like most - listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stop points - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to the other, lighting one person or another person, or choir, or orchestra.
"It's the most exciting, this building," the opera evaluates the musical director and director Andris Poga of the concert studio "Purgy and Besa".
Opera visitors agree that this is a grandiose event.
They are delighted to hear the famous Gærsvina opera in this world.
Happy is the spirit of the world that can be found in Liepah.
"Performance professional", the operas are rated by the visitor Edgars Lams.
The concert studio was special by playing the orchestra for the first time in the newly opened concert hall "Great Dintars" and for the first time the opera concert was held.
The restored buildings of the Museum of Art could be named after Janja Rozental.
Riga Vice Mayor Andris Andris America in his opening of the rosental anniversary exhibition said that the museum's own address could in future not be Krisian Valdemar Street 10a, but Janja Rosental Field 1.
The museum director, Māra Láce, acknowledged that the re-registration of the address would create a rigid bureaucratic burden, but generally this idea is welcomed and therefore agreed to the municipal proposal.
The main stone of the city of Riga has been laid for this idea in 1936, by setting up the monument of Burcarda Dzen for Jani Rozental, which is located at the museum.
The former director of the museum, Wilhelm Purvitis, was one of the initiators of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I don't know where his name is all the time. But where will we leave his name?
"But if you, Mr. America, are willing to give it up," said Lace.
It has been reported that the National Museum of Art was officially overlooking its doors in May following an extensive reconstruction and modernisation.
This week will finally begin the reconstruction of the VEF Cultural Castle.
More than 11 million euros have been renewed by the Welve SIA.
It is planned to renovate several castle spaces, including two viewers’ medicines, as well as to adapt the building to people with movement disorders.
The Council of Riga has planned to attract a project of EUR six million from the European Union funds, but the Director of the Council's Properties Department of Riga recognises that there is still no full clarity about the European funds for the project.
"Despite the political desire to start the recovery of the VEF Cultural Pillar by attracting the European Structural Funds, it is, for months we await a decision, real action by the officials of the Ministry of Finance, that money will be allocated or not," says Burovs.
Last December we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission to make your own decision that Brussels is not taking a decision here.
Now we see another round of discussions emerging, so we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that Riga's mind certainly guarantees that this process will be launched and completed in time," said Burov.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Cultural Castle collectively held an opening concert before, immediately, the expected renovations of the building.
Although the year passed, the renovation of the building had not yet begun and continued to work collectively under inappropriate conditions.
The strategy of the Riga Council Property Department of the VEF Cultural Palace divided the renovation into seemingly independent reconstruction teams, where each will ensure the implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is to increase the availability of the VEF Cultural Castle and improve the area.
It provides for the setting up of environments and engineering communications as well as the restoration of building facades.
Second - Improving the supply of cultural services in VEF.
It plans to improve the study of interiors, walls and thresholds of the building, views and sound records, as well as to arrange internal engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improving creative amateur collective working conditions, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "Livu", the legendary hand group can be seen at the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will cover various "Lives" features - photographs arranged in a time line to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the group's activities are notified.
The participants' performances, musical instruments, awards and concerts will also be shown, as well as other things not yet seen to the wider audience, which reflected the creative activities of the "Live" group.
The exhibition will be complemented with the objects of the Liepaja Museum.
The visual representation of the exhibition was written in cooperation with fashion artist and artist Elitu Patmalnieci.
The musicians who were associated with the "Lives" group and their neighbors also responded to the call and shared both objects and memories.
The beginnings of "Livu" are being sought in 1972 when a vocal instrumental assembly led by Juris Pavitols is set up in Liepaja's cultural house.
The assembly took part in the festival "Liepājas dintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in city and republic views.
A fateful meeting took place in 1976 when Juris Pavitols met with Éric Kyigheli and a group of Metalurgians in the castle of culture, calling for the joining of Ingrída Gutmani, Andri Kruzini and Jani Grodum.
Over the years, the composition of the group has not once been considered.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - the desire to prove that Latvian handicrafts are able to live and exist - is still unchanged.
"What you can see is not missing - ginsotes, matinees and beards, these boys are quite different from the generally accepted stereotype of the stage," says music viewer Klass Vāvere.
In the group without the above mentioned musicians such as Igo, Vilnius Krieviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Starks, Lamis Raceneniks, Teleis Pusbarniks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Bríze, Guntars Mucenieks, Danis Virga, Thomas Kleins and many others.
The entrance to the exhibition is free of charge.
The exhibition will be held from 19 August to 30 October.
On the other hand, in the 27th of August, Lipaja concert hall "Pūt, Winds" will be held by the group "Livi" for 40 years of celebration "LIVIfest 2".

Zbignev Stankevičs: The time is coming, and the truth is upstairs.
The archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, the metropolis Zbignev Stankevičs, in the interview, emphasizes to the Independent that if we want to gain the power of life, we must keep the Gospel message in its centre.
For the power of the truth is greater than the power of the wicked one.
Many are already on their way to the celebration of the Most Holy New Mary in the heavens of Aglon.
What message will faithful ones receive there this year?
In recent years, the Lord’s Evening Meal has expressed his desire to take the lead in the ministry in Aglon.
As a result, the main message is also in his sense.
It is also about the tradition of the Crusades leading the bishop John Bull.
He will also make his own message.
The day before, I was in charge of the sacred service of the Watch Tower Society.
Last year I turned my attention to the French encyclical "Laudato si" and updated the common house, the theme of the Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course, I'm watching what's going on in the world, and I'm trying to talk about it.
My approach coincided with the church’s recommendation that the Gospel message be kept in the center of life.
It should be demonstrated that the Gospel accounts answer some of the most painful problems in human life and inspire him to follow a further course.
Then it speaks to people.
But Ceses, in the Lamp discussion, you said that "you must return to the understanding of the whole human being."
What do you understand?
Does this mean that a person is turning away from the message of the church?
And does the church today have such a return?
A man dying on the side of a road in the capital of India.
No one in the capital of India is left to know about a man who died on the road - it turns out he's been on the road for an hour and then he's still robbed, informs the BBC.
It has been reported that a man who was identified as Matibül went on a daily journey with a boat, but worked as a guard at night.
Matthew 5:30 in the morning went home on the road when he was hit by a light car.
The surveillance camera records indicate that the driver left the car to see the victim and then left.
After an hour when no one was aware of the bleeding man, a mob surrounded him.
About 90 minutes after the crash, the police arrived and the victim was taken to a hospital where he died of his injuries.
By withdrawing his candidacy to the post of Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the Head of the State Environment Service, Inga Kolīgova, who saved the government from the fall, is regarded as an associate professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Latvia.
Koljegova's explanation of the withdrawal of the candidacy in the coalition ruling the opposition is linked to the fact that she has prevented the government from falling.
In Skudra's conversation with the agency, LETA said that it was difficult for him to imagine that he would support Koljegova's candidacy at the government meeting next week.
Therefore, if the unity ministers voted against, but Koljegovov was so approved in his office, it would lead to the government's resignation.
The expert also considers that, prior to the declaration on the withdrawal of the candidacy, Koljegova has consulted both Finance Ministers Dana Reiznieci-Ozola and Prime Minister Māri Kučinski.
At the same time, it is also an accession to "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
In predicting whether an appropriate candidate will be able to be found by the competition, Skudra acknowledged that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be chosen, or the institution will continue to lead Dace Pelèe as a performer of the duties of the Director-General.
At the same time, he points out - if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that another candidacy is not being considered, it is home to Pelekjak that he must not participate in the competition.
LETA has already reported that the Head of the State Environment Service, Kolīgova, has decided to withdraw his candidacy as Director-General of the VID.
Due to the "Unity" objections, the government postponed the approval of Koljegova on Tuesday for a week as Director-General of the VID.
After the government’s decision to postpone the decision, Koljegova testified that she was still ready to become the head of the VID.
However, she later changed her mind - in a presentation to Finance Minister Dani Reizniece-Ozolai on Friday, she points out that she withdraws her consent to move to the role of VID manager and this is not an easy choice for her.
Prime Minister Māra Kučinska's press secretary Andrejs Vavars told the agency LETA that a new competition would be held for the vacant Director-General of the VID.
There was an accident in the centre of Riga involving a police car.
A road accident involving a State police car took place in central Riga this afternoon.
The police car with the sound and light signals on will rush to the top of the category until Krishija Barona and Djirnava hit another car on the street.
The police explain the circumstances, but the initial information shows that the second force has not been launched along the police car.
In an accident, a woman suffered.
This year, the population in Riga has declined
At the beginning of this year, there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015 when 641,000 people were officially registered in the capital, LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Administration (CSP).
On the other hand, in terms of population, the capital of Latvia is located in the 30th place between the capitals of the European Union (EU) and the major cities where the population exceeds one million.
According to data from the EU Statistics Office, Eurostat is the largest proportion of women in Riga - the capital of Latvia is in the first place convincingly among the largest European cities with 127 women to 100 men.
In all three capitals of the Baltic States, the highest proportion of women in the largest cities in Europe is 123, while in Tallinn 121 women per 100 men.
The warning icon shall be located at the LNMM.
In the next few days at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM) there will be warning signs - pictograms, LETA told the agency, the representative of the Department of Property of Riga Council, Baiba Gailite.
It is now a success to repair the glass-glazed rapid damage caused by the operation of border boards.
In the next few days, there will be icons of warning.
It will tell its inhabitants that the roof can be slippery rains and snowtime, so it must not be moved by cars, as well as by bicycles, slippers, and slippers.
On that social network, "Facebook" was also written by Ušakov, who indicated that no security threats would lead to damage, but "seems of inaccuracy" and "coming to know".
Celebrations for children and parents- New children's playgrounds are set up in Riga.
During this summer season, the Riga municipality has installed two new playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and Chiekurkal, which are already available to children.
A wide, multifunctional toy ship with various bathing elements, bridges, games, pipes and ski hills is installed on the Chipsala beach.
The playground is for children of all ages.
The field is also equipped with slurry and various balancing elements.
The fantasy world for small ships is exposed to the attraction location on the coast of Daugava with a view to the passenger port and the cruise ships visible there.
On the other hand, in the field of games between Čiekurkalna 4 and 5 intersections, there is a home of games, buttocks, stage paths, balance bridge, symposia, toys and other elements of the game, as well as a ring-ring area with strength and coordination training, as well as sports elements.
Below the field is covered by rubber in different colors.
There is a new, colorful roof on the side of the street for the playing field.
Reconstructed road phase discovered in honey.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of VAS Latvian State Roads (LVC) as well as the representatives of the construction companies SIA "Binders" and the municipal authorities have today discovered the Russian border of the reconstructed national highway (Grebnjeva) -Rézekne-Daugavpils-Lithuva border (Medumi) (A13) stage from Medum to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km).
The roads are a national map, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed stage on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of how the co-financing of the European Union funds improves the situation on national highways.
"As forecasts show, the resources available for roads during this planning period will be available in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue to maintain the most difficult roads in very good quality, as well as to ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding," stressed Uldis Augulis.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing for Latvia's roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
The construction phase from Medum to the border of Lithuania (156.4.163.5 km) SIA Binders started last year and continued this year after a technological break.
The reconstruction costs are EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"In the restored road phase, the road construction has been fully renovated and the next year will begin repairing the next stage from Medum to Daugavpilij itself, and will therefore be arranged all the way from the border of Lithuania to Daugavpilij," informed LVC Board President Jānis Lange.
The main roads of the country are the most heavily laden, and by 2018 we plan to ensure that all the main roads of the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality by ensuring regular maintenance in a timely manner and to replace the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"There will, of course, be a need for adequate funding, and all travellers are looking forward to the proposals made by the expert group to arrange the road financing system," Lange noted.
As part of the project, road connections and lighting are arranged in the Medjugorje Centre.
Substantial land works have been carried out: in four stages, large-scale decoupling and large-scale waste and waste works, a balanced long-distance profile, which has been very uneven so far.
The public transport space is also restored and the return area for public transport is newly built.
Before the road there was insufficient capacity and the area relief was not transparent because of the mountain valleys and the old road with the total relief.
The next construction season is scheduled to restore the road phase from the border of Daugavpils city until the phase that has been rebuilt (144,80,156,40 km).
This year, LVC plans to carry out various types of work more than 1100 kilometres of national road.
Information on all repairs planned on the national road network this year is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"To achieve the desired weight reduction results, it is very important to choose the right food combinations," says Lithuanian Dietologist Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easy to do during the summer period when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
The combination of thought-based food products can help not only to reduce excess weight but also to promote the various processes of the body.
Macarone and etiquette are a successful combination because it provides a long-lasting sense of silk and helps to fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that ethics has a positive effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel tired.
Cayenne peppers and protein rich food, such as poultry meat or protein cocktails, not only produces a bitter feeling but also reduces the burning after large meals in the next few meals.
The combination of such foods can also be increased by up to 35% of calorie burnt after meal.
Studies have shown that Kayenne’s peppers can help to break free from fat in the abdomen.
The egg contains a metabolic nutrient - choline, while the pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
Taking sufficient amounts of this food can reduce cortisol levels, thus also accumulation of fat around the body’s middle.
The egg yolk butter, which has been added to fresh berries, has another dish and fat burning meal for breakfast that is worth included in your menu.
Oats and oats contain fibers that, according to Canadian scientists, control the grelline - appetiteed stimulating hormone - and thus also the feeling of hunger.
In addition, sheep contain polyphenols that are helpful in reducing weight and do not allow fat formation.
Plants and proteins can also perform miracles in reducing weight.
Such a combination can create a feeling of silk.
Plants contain water and fibers, so they contribute to the feeling of silk.
At the same time, protein slows the digestion process and provides a sense of slowness for a longer period of time.
In lunch you can eat salads or prepare protein cocktails from the ready mixture and enjoy them together with your favorite vegetables.
Avoid any combination of these products.
The fruit contains sugars - monosaccharides or dissaccharides - one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the starch in the vegetables is polysaccharide.
The fruit is mechanically divided in the stomach, but it is not chemically divided until it reaches the third or fourth degree in the digestive process in the gut.
The starch is divided into three different stages, starting with the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after meals.
Eating sweet food immediately after meals, it is "prostituted" in the stomach together with other foods where it is not chemically digested and begins to vomit.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, grains, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate products together with lemons, lime, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptialine, which is present in the silica, operates only in the alkaline environment.
Fruit acids do not only inhibit the degradation of carbohydrates, but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk and milk and similar protein-rich products at one meal.
They require different digestive juices, each with different strengths, signs and times when to get into the stomach.
Arbus, honeymelone, muscatmelone and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons are not crushed if they are in the stomach together with other foodstuffs.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with solids, but the same cannot be said of fats and proteins - fats hinder protein degradation.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large quantity of protein-containing products is consumed, avoid using fat altogether.
This also applies to freshening - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of nuts (contained proteins) with whole avocados (contained fats).
Such a combination hinders effective weight loss.
How better to prepare?
"Food preparation, thermal treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original ingredient," says the dietologist.
In most cases, food is lost by boiling in water.
However, the value of some foods increases, directly by heating.
After boiling, it is recommended to use the remaining liquid for the preparation of soup - in this case you will not lose any nutrients left in the water and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to prepare the vegetables, including by steaming them.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene contained in tomatoes.
When you store tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betacarotine in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, burcans, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The heat treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural properties of existing proteins, making them easier to digest.
The heat treatment of meat and eggs also makes the iron contained in these products and other minerals easier to absorb in the body.
It should also be kept in mind that freezing products can reduce vitamin C levels from 10% to 90%, but the freezing of the fibre does not affect.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase the intake of iron into the body, which in turn ensures better functioning of the brain and muscles.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-bloody iron found in plant products such as beans, leaves, cereal products than blood-staining iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and vista.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-bloody iron in the body by using products containing non-bloody iron with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and eggs.
Vitamin C helps change non-bloody iron so that our body can absorb it more easily.
Iron is required for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen supply in the muscles and brains.
To obtain the maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fats such as olive oil or linseed oil.
When preparing buttermeas with salmon, add vitamin D rich salmon or sardines with no added yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestine and plays an important role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other full grain products) together with vitamin C sources such as soils, rivers, avenues and other fruits or eggs help to stabilise cholesterol levels and avoid arterial excretion.
Snapchat Anime criticises the effect of Asian cartooning
Snapchat representatives say that this filter has inspired animation, but some commentators say it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality and play with their identity in an absurd way every day.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, dog or image that would fit into the painting of Roja Lichstenstein.
The funds are cloudy, image-distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million self-adjusted per day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public.
Snapchat lens effects have already been criticised earlier by getting the impressions that the application popularizes too blacker or brighter face tones as an ideal beauty benchmark.
This week, the new lens effects were published to allow users to form eye-to-eye, soluble teeth and round cheeks, and some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon – "golden gimmies".
It was also asked whether such contradictions do not show that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public denial broke out on Wednesday, when The Verge and Motherboard reported that lens effects have been removed from the application.
The company explained that the lens was intended to paint pictures of Anime, not to carize people of Asian origin.
But for people who have experienced racism, these effects have reminded of the painful stereotypes.
Others categorically rejected the similarity with Anime.
Students of Korean American Art Grais Spapani Twitter's entry on the images gained a broad resonance. In her e-mail, she indicates that lens effects are "accursed and uncomfortable to say no more".
She added that it is difficult to ignore the obvious similarity between Asian caricatures and lens effects.
This shows that the lens effect is not simply a yellow face but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural areas.
American culture is also involved in an unending struggle for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use every day.
And Snapchat's large youth audience, representing different races, unlike the older people, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that insults users, then "in modern times such things are not left undetected", said 25-year-old Katie Zhou on Thursday in the interview.
On Thursday, the company’s manager of Medium Zhou’s product deleted his Snapchat application and advised others to do the same.
In her article "Medium" and telephone interview, she explained that she felt that racial issues were due to Snapchat's employment policy, which did not support racial diversity enough.
Zhou criticised the company’s management, which consists mainly of white men and then concluded his article with reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"It means that there are no racial differences in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Whether there are some other racial representatives in the company, but they do not take the role of being able to express their views safely and comfortably," says U.S.A. Zhou.
Her opinion also agrees with others, while Snapchat did not respond to her complaint.
The company does not disclose the number of employees of different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his employees, but his representative found that the company had hired a staff expert who would focus on representing the company also racial minorities who were not widely represented and would promote its inclusion.
Zhou, on the other hand, will not update his Snapchat account by adding: "It's interesting whether they really need more users like us to understand that it's not right."
The House of Congress reports that military officials have damaged reports about the Islamic State.
In a statement issued Thursday, the House of Congress points out that the US Central Order representatives have worsened the reports by depicting the war against the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria far more optimistic than is true.
Analysts of the Central Order Intelligence Service express general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the Unit of the Task Force set up by the Committee of Armed Forces, the Committee of Inquiry and the Sub-Committee on the Financing of the Republics of the Republics, indicating that their management controlled reports on the success of Americans in the fight against the Islamic State.
The central order, known as Centcom, is the military base in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news of this report is that the intelligence reports approved by the senior leaders of Centcom reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positively than it really is.
The representative of the Republic of California, Ken Kalverts, says: "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our warriors are those who suffer when our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom's management errors are being sought at the top management of the organisation.
This 10-page long report details the existing problems in the Central Order's reflection and analyzes the efforts of the Americans to prepare Iraq's forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide conclusive evidence that Obama’s senior officials had had to destroy reports, it shows that Centcom’s management has put some pressure on analysts to take a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic State (also known as the ISIS or ISIL).
The report states that, in the first half of 2015, Central Management Press Releases, Communications and Reports illustrated the situation in a much more positive light than it really was.
For example, Centcom’s representatives publicly announced that Mosula’s recovery operation could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosula is the second largest city in Iraq, still under the control of the Islamic State.
The representative of the Republican Party of Kansas, Mike Pompeo, in his report, said: "The investigation for several months clearly confirms this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the US Central Management Chief officials have reduced reports by depicting ISIS threats in Iraq less than they were true.
The Republican Party set up a working group to know that the analysts are concerned that the information about the Islamic country is being corrupted.
For further investigation, new findings will follow the report published on Thursday in this case.
The Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence shall conduct an investigation into the activities of the Centcom Intelligence Service.
On Thursday, the members of the Democratic Party of the Management Committee for the Investigation published their own report, in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Working Party of the Republic.
In his report, the representative of the Democrats Adam B. Schifs said that Centcom had limited the preparation of intelligence evaluation reports in connection with the ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces from 2014 to 2015.
Mr. Schifa explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", made the work of analysts worse and "distributed false facts."
But the members of the Shifs and the Democratic Party have added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports according to the "pre-defined or political position".
The Daily Beast published on Thursday the preliminary results of the congress investigation.
In August The New York Times reported that the Inspector General of the Pentagon initiated an investigation into Centcom’s analyst’s complaints.
The representative of the Pentagon, Commander-in-Chief Patrick Evans, announced that the Pentagon will not comment on the congress report until the investigation continues.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Ministry of Defence and the Research Administration call for a constructive dialogue on vital issues of national security.
The investigation is not limited to the question whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement made by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's allegations raise questions as to whether President Obama can fully rely on the Central Management reports on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism of Islamic State Investigation recalls more than ten years old events when Centcom investigator Gregory Höcker published his study, claiming that George V. Bush's administration started the war in Afghanistan, thinking too little of its possible consequences.
Höcker also played an important role in discovering the question of Islamic State.
Last year, officials reported that the Hücker team discovered that, contrary to public reports, air flights to Islamic State oil factories did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group because they had built temporary factories to sell oil in the black market.
In the September issue of The Times, it was reported that this discovery did not come outside the Central Management walls.
At that time, Commander General Lloyd Ostin III received a criticism of the axis, as many lawmakers believed that the war reports were too positive.
In April, General Austin took his leave and replaced General Josephs L. Votel.
In the U.S. duel with British women in field hockey, the U.S. wins, thus winning the fourth victory in turn.
The day after the victory over Japan with the result of 6:1, Katie Bama won the first two doors of the US women's field hockey team on Thursday, when the Americans won the Indian team with the result of 3:0.
Five gate wins in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but 27 - year - old Bama said that she could not remember if she had ever succeeded.
She said, "I don't have a feeling."
I'm not one of those people who is counting their gates.
But she knows that the result of the Americans in the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them in their group an inseparable deal with Britain, which on Thursday after winning over Japan with the inseparable 2:0.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for a quarter final and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the six team and which second.
The first winner will stay a little longer from meeting with the strong Dutch sample, which is the leader of the second group.
Despite the fact that the Saturday game was not going on, the Americans have already called for a surprising wind, four years ago, taking the last place among the 12 teams in London.
That team also had Bama
She grew up in Bluebel, she first took the wild hockey nuues in her hands at 3 years of age (her older twin sisters had already worked with this sport type in Drexel) and joined the national selection when she was 16 years old, becoming a selection in the history of the latest players.
She did not attend the 2008 Olympics because she did not enter the final.
However, in 2012 she and her team were unsuccessful.
The following year, Craig Parham was appointed as a selection coach and everything changed to the right.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical changes."
We didn't invest as much in London as we do now.
We have completely changed everything.
In a Thursday game, Bama discovered the result of winning the doors in the first half with a back meth from close distance.
Indian games started without winning in their account, but their selection was very strong and maintained a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period when Bama again won the gates.
She introduced the babes to the enemy zone on the left side of the field, and then she noticed going to the middle of the field and spreading the babes at the door of the opponent, placing them in the direction of the American 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales gained another gate.
This was the first U.S. Ward of Jackie Brigades dry game, each of the first three games bursting through one gate.
She's fallen asleep.
And so is Bama.
"We're going very well now," said Paham, but just as well, the game will appear on Saturday.
The most instructive meal of the period of depression is "Devil's Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his election as President, Franklin Delano Ruszvelt sat in an oval room to hold meals.
President Ruszwelt enjoyed delicious culinary delicacies such as ossu liver paste or fuagra and Meriland brown soup.
At that time, however, her meal was much richer: eggs filled with tomato butter, potato beespox and dessert — a puddle of flowers.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "It's a way of solidarity in cooking with people who were very serious."
Her husband, Andrew Cou, adds: "It's also a message for Americans to eat."
A couple from the Brooklyn Heights area are food historians.
As described in the last book of the "Gorzenjes Sautēžuja" in America, Ziegelmane describes the life of the "97 Ābeles" in his book through a food rental home in eastern Manhattan.
Their new joint work "Datītītīte", which will be published on Tuesday by the Harper edition, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
By expressing some solidarity in the culinary, they held meals together with reporters "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple luncheon in the area of Flatiron since 1929, when great depression began.
At 54 years of age, Ms. Ziegelmanes ordered butter with roasted cheese and minced olives, while 57-year-old Kou ordered tomato, potato beet and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered a fake hook, the couple recognized that his choice was very suitable for the negotiation of the Great Depression Time Meal .
Ms. Ziegelmanes told me that the fake rabbit was very popular.
There was an earthquake, a liver, and a bee.
They were prepared from basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meals.
Let's think about what it's like to eat so much peanuts that they'll be in place for lunch.
Mr. Kou has changed.
"Well, it just seemed like the stomach is full of flowers," he added.
In pre-depression years, the American lunch table was similar to the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were prepared to eat their husbands-workers and were offered freshly prepared spices in lunches, lunches and dinners.
During World War I, the Americans sent food directly to Europeans. The "Satan's Meal" described how the Americans adapted to the conditions when America was no longer a land of overcrowding.
"At that time the food became the main focus of the people's everyday life," said Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly on this subject.
Just as important were the new budget diets: unknown foods such as fake mushrooms and dried foods became everyday, the droughts were "a great way to use surpluses," noted Ms. Ziegelmane, as food could hide the unattractive ingredients under cremable measures.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which for many years was the main ingredient in American meals, now became an extremely rare luxury commodity.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than taste, new, yet unseen forms of sex.
In an ancient manuscript, Mrs. Ziegelmanes found recipes for the preparation of potatoes filled with peanut butter.
Mr. Kou adds: "It wasn't a popular lunch supplement."
Ms. Ziegelmane points out, "It was sire."
Butter of peanuts andcepts are not compatible.
Many home food recipes were used during difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Economics from 1923 to 1943, set national eating habits that were not experienced before and after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised households to become "economicists" and to accept challenges such as turning pasta and burcan mix into a delicious meal.
"The Holy Meal" is a historic treat.
It is particularly interesting to see evidence of the government's attitude to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hüver's "let me eat pork".
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and eating in Iowa, he actually ate as a fine millionaire that he had become.
Mr. Kou says: "He liked the European cuisine, for example, fish with gourmet butter."
He ate in the almost reddish living room, wearing lunch jackets.
He was completely out of reality.
President Ruszwelt would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not recommended that he set an example of his eating habits.
The book says that Ruszvelt will reward a domestic servant who did not learn how to prepare to eat, thus the White House became "a place where not only one of the worst meals was served in Washington, but also the worst-prepared meals".
As soon as the national economy recovers, most of the ordinary culinary conditions of the depression age have disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutrition, as well as to how to use science in the culinary, Mrs Ziegelmane added.
A couple say that in writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as why she was unable to throw out food.
"She was really afraid to throw out food," said Mr. Kou.
Ms. Ziegelmanes said, "She actually cheated on people."
Once there was an accident with wind pigs.
When we were eating at the Eisenberg station, a couple of writers pulled out a desert prepared in the Finnish home: a flower puddle, which President Ruszvelts used to eat in lunch.
"It's plumbing," said Mrs. Ziegelmanes, adding that at the time there was a widespread arrival for the rich foods to give such a name.
It does not contain affluence, only dried flowers, a few flours, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All were impatiently placed in the brown mass of the carotid that was on the solution.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou ate some more coumus.
Listening to an experienced "economicist", he said to his wife, "I'd like to have a snout of strawberries."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenditure in the fight against Merck on Hepatitis C patent
The judge of the District has decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to recover the costs of legal services it has paid in the case of the release of a Hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of a 200 million pounds penalty for two Merck patents being dropped, which threatened it with regard to the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets when the U.S. federal judge found irregularities in Mer's activities, such as lying after a sworn transfer and other non-ethical activities.
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bets Labson Fries pointed out that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for the legal expenses incurred by it in defending this case.
Merck is trying to get a position on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with new generations of Hepatitis C medicines, which are effective in 90% of the cases of liver disease.
The case was initiated already in 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other, trying to acquire ownership of the newly developed active components sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead medicine.
The U.S. supported forces claim that they have taken full control of Manbiz’s city from the Islamic State.
The U.S.-backed forces have completely taken over the northern part of Manbiz's city at the Turkish border and the last Islamic National Warriors have left the city, the group's representative announced on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now clearing the city of the last enemy fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 civilians and civilians who had been captured by fighters, Reuters told the news agency Sharfan Darvis from the Manbiz Military Council of the SDS.
"Now the city is in full control of us and we are looking for fighters," he informed the agency Reuters.
Clinton's income reached $10.75 million in 2015 and the couple paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate.
Hilaria Clinton published a 2015 tax statement on Friday, showing that the Democratic Party president and her husband have earned $10.75 million this year and have paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent, respectively.
During 2015 Clinton has donated $1 million, mainly to his Clinton charity organization. Former President Bill Clinton has earned about $5.3 million, acting as a speaker and former Secretary of State has earned $3 million from his book on work in the State Department, which was published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton polling partner - U.S. State Senator Tim Keins and his wife Anna Holtone have published their tax statement for the last 10 years.
In 2015 they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hilaria Clintone and Tim Keins continue to set new financial transparency standards," reported Clinton campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri in their statement.
On the other hand, Donald Tramps is hiding behind various enticements and rumors in order not to fulfill the promises to disclose his tax information.
The publication of paid tax information is a record practice for the US President's candidates, but it is not required by law.
The New York businessman Tramps and his lawyers refer to an audit of the State Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your Walk", on his Twitter entry, told Clinton's campaign partner Ian Sams about the tax information of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Michael Kohens told CNN that he would not allow Trappa to publish tax information before completion of the audit.
Critics, including the candidate of the President of the Republican Party of 2012 Mits Romnia and other Republicans, claim that his refusal raises questions about his real estate, contributions and other business commitments, including his commitments to Russia.
Clinton paid for his oil fire by publishing a video on Friday, where several influential Republicans ask Tramp to publish their tax information.
She returned to this issue during her economic speech in Michigan on Thursday.
She announced: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have done for decades."
Politico reports that during the 1990s, tramps paid very little or no taxes, and on Friday the New York Times business column wrote that many bookkeepers and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in the election of this President.
Clinton, supporting the proposal of the billionaire Varena Bafeta, popularizes the idea that every person who earns more than $1 million a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
President Baraks Obama also supports this proposal.
Last week, during Clinton’s speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, Bafets called on tramp to exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he was also audited by the Revenue Service and Tramps was afraid of voters, not tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax information until 2007.
Klintoni now lives in Chapakva, New York and has paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014 and a total tax rate of around 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 Clinton tax report shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clintoni received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticises the hotel in Berlin about the closure of Israel's telephony code at an Arab request - RT News
The director of French films of Jewish origin raised wind in social media when he discovered that there is no Israeli telephony code available at the Campinski Bristol hotel in Berlin. The hotel staff base it on the demand of Arab customers.
Claude Lancman, a documentary film about the Holocaust director "Shoah", did not hide his discontent with the Berlin Hotel "Kempinski Bristol" and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lancman tried to find the list of Israeli telephone codes in the hotel’s offer.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been defeated and destroyed?
Written by Lancmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers to call this country through its call centre.
The Director requested an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer he received "has shocked him".
The hotel manager explained that "it was a known hotel management decision".
The reason for the withdrawal of the code was even more contacted by the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabic and they have requested the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancman quoted the hotel worker's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that the Ambassador of Israel to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, has referred to this case as "a great kangaroo".
We are surprised and shocked at this incident.
The same is true of yourself.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany, that is, in this hotel network there is even greater humiliation.
There is no need for comparisons.
The official said, "We hope that the hotel will make the right conclusions."
This event also gained quite a lot of resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel has simply issued to Arab customers.
Another entry was sent "boil," indicating that the hotel was located in Kurfurstendamm street next to the synagogue.
The Der Spiegel issue reports that the hotel itself quickly rejected all the advances, declaring that it was all "understand" and apologizing to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted the Kempinski representative.
And add that the code has been added to the list again.
Police use rubber metal and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The student and police clash took place on Thursday in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in demonstration against government education reform.
The police used rubber balls and tear gas against students.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to eliminate the students, resulting in the police using rubber castings and tear gas.
A number of hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to show their displeasure with the reform of the education system.
The proposal by Governor Geraldo Alckmina of São Paulo is aimed at closing almost 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be moved to other schools to save money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against temporary President Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when the students gathered in demonstrations to express their support for the displaced President Dilma Rousef, whose influence was put to the vote by the Senate.
Scott Kelums Skinner finish first, bringing the UK gold medals on a round
Kelums Skinners from Scotland finished his first Men's Riding Team in a race in Rio, which took place last night. The British team protected its championship title, which it won in 2012 in London.
The 23-year-old sportsman from Glasgow played an important role in these games, making Ser Kris Hoi a proud legendary scott and winning the New Zealand favorites.
Four years ago, Britain won a surprising victory when Hoys won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated it again at the World Championship in London, although Hoy had already finished his sports career.
The problems were between the Beijing-London Olympics, as experienced startup specialists James Staff had to be replaced.
They did it the last time.
When Hoys left, he tried to fill out Kians Emadi and Mets Krampton.
British coaches hoped for Skinner in view of the potential he later proved.
Hindus, Kenya - champions who started four years ago with Hoo and Skinner, who installed the Olympic Qualifications Record, but the best start was for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hindus were close - minded, Kenyan leaders, and Skinners protected them.
The change of strategy played an important role in victory, because the Hindus drove with greater transport to allow Kenya and especially Skinner to drive faster.
Hoys saw the contests as a BBC representative and captured the views of Skinner, Kenya, and Hindu eyes at the time when they were digging on their foreheads.
The 23-year-old spokesperson said, "It was an indescribable honor."
I'm doing my best to defend my name.
Finally, we set up the Olympic record and won the World Championships.
It was just unbelievable.
There's no better victory.
After winning the 2012 Olympic Games with Kenya and Hoo in London, Hindus admitted that they wanted to fall on the track after a failed start.
Later, he defended this comment and the British competitors were not able to prove otherwise.
There was no such incident at the time.
The Hindus said: "The British flags in the Tribes recalled London."
In the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so victory in the Olympics was really special.
One medal will be awarded to a country that won seven out of ten gold medals in the racing race in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a performance indicator in the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of Kenya’s outcome, he could really repeat Hoya’s success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
In addition, Kenya was born on March 23rd (it seems to be a British holy date because Steve Regreivs, Mo Farahs and Rogers Banisters were born on this day too).
Hoys was also born on this date.
Kenya's next match is clear, which starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old sportsman from Bolton said, "Now I'm just enjoying it.
Team trip is always the best.
Because then you can win with the team members.
If you're honest, then winning one is a little lonely."
Hindus said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed as a soldier."
That day it was the only battle for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bredley Vigins, Eds Klensius, Steve Burkes and Owens Douls presented the fastest qualification time for four kilometres.
Their time was 3:51,943
The world record that was installed in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and final will take place today on the second side of the day, where Vigins will definitely be in the center of attention.
Yesterday before his qualification trip, he was in agreement with the Commissioner when the judges called him to measure his growth.
In the women's journey, which will continue and end today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Shanda, Elinora Barkere and Katie Archibald from Milgavia set a new record time 4:13,260.
The UK delegation hopes that the British wheeling team will, hopefully, compete in the middle of the Olympics.
Remembering the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone looks forward to the same achievements in Rio.
While behind them has been various, after charges of sexism and respect, technical director Sheins Saton has resigned, and Hoys and Victoria Bendleton also finish their career.
However, starting with the first bicycle races, it seems that the UK will always reach its highest level in the right time.
The future of the Portland cottages becomes unclear as a vast contract has been terminated.
The future of Aluminum sheds and hundreds of its employees in Portland has become unclear in Victoria as its main client has announced the interruption of the cooperation.
This Communication is based on the Victorian Government's plans to suspend the subsidy of the energy company, which is vitally important for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year grant will be suspended in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs in the Alkoa Portland plant are at risk.
There could be risks up to 2000 of both direct and indirect jobs.
In addition, it will also have unexpected side effects as the boiler consumes about 10 percent of all Victorian electricity.
In 2014, Alcoa closed down Point Henry, which led to a stoppage in the operation of the English power station.
The Alkoas Portland shed works with losses and can be closed.
These events led to years of speculation about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of factory production.
The plant's energy supplier "AGL", which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power station in Latrouba Iele, says that the other three owners will probably also terminate their contracts.
Most power plants belong to the Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, as well as parts of the company belong to Chinese holding companies CITIC and Marubeni Corp.
"AGL" expects the continuation of the operation of the Portland plant, which would mean further supply of energy to the boiler," said its representative.
‘AGL’ stated that the contracts are so-called ‘risk-restrictive contracts’, which are intended to enter into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in fiscal year 2017," said the company representative.
From the fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profit limits favourable market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices in the future.
"AGL" claims that it has already calculated losses of $187 million in its forecasts , providing that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa reports that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue its activities or to supply energy to it.
The US company reports that in 2010 it concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but in November it will be terminated. The company does not provide explanations as to why it will cease its cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland shed in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the weak economy of the sector.
AGL Executive Director Stevens Mikelson said last week that 600 megawatts and tomago 900 megawatts were spent during the year, according to analysts.
If both of these factories were to leave the energy market, the demand for energy would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160,000 people annually.
Every year, more than 160,000 people's requirements are rejected, as well as reducing the budget, the situation could get worse.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal harassment - are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, which has already been overloaded, warns that reducing funding will only make the situation worse.
From June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than so far.
The Director of the Legal Centre of Queensland, James Farel, said that the latest report of the National Legal Centres Association said that legal aid is now being denied to thousands of people who need it.
Master Farel pointed out that if this decision is not repealed, the situation will only become worse.
He also says: "The legal centre of Queensland is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that the aid is denied to thousands of people who need it."
People who seek to end violent relations, people with deep debts, families experiencing divorce, workers who are unjustly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 per cent, meaning that more than a thousand people in Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to stop the funding reduction immediately so that those in need of legal assistance can obtain it.
Last year, the government discovered its plans to build a level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to pay attention also to the needs of local communities and their clients and to the Palazčuk government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trampa's campaign was brought before the court because one of the employees fired a gunman
New York: Donald Trampa campaign organizers are accused of not having acted on the information that his North Carolina operations manager turned firearms against an employee when they drove in one car in February.
This incident was described in court proceedings brought by Vincent Bordini, the former campaign programmer at Charlotte's court on Wednesday.
Bordini said that he had waited for months for an internal review to begin, but realized that this would not happen.
The leader, Earl Philips, "drawed the gun, placed his right index finger on the forehead and turned the table against Vincent's way", Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claimed that when he filed a complaint with the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people had experienced the same.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause losses," Bordini said in his complaint.
Only two days before this case was filed, the candidate of the Republican Party to the presidential office caused the scandal by informing people that "The People of the Second Amendment", i.e. the owners and enthusiasts of the weapons, could take action if the will would win his victory by Hilaria Clinton and his elected judges.
Trampa’s campaigners announced that the media had taken his name out of context, and he never smoked anyone into violence.
Bordini, with his request, wants compensation from campaign organizers for the despicable surveillance, but from Filips - for the attack, the use of illegal weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
Trampa's representative, Hope Hiksa, did not comment immediately.
I haven't been able to contact Philips.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip recently left the campaign.
He also failed to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consultation Services".
The candidate for President of the Republican Party, Donald Tramps, has carried out a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - holidays of the town and sport in Kūlcije.
On Saturday, for the first time, the people gathered at the festivals of the city and the sport.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided this time that the Festival of Booths would no longer be held.
The new pages have now been revised.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the game was not in traditional ways and too serious to take, because, for example, the shots had to be put to the sleeping goal, the devil flew, with a man's left-hand mark, "bumbling" was not at all in any Olympic games.
However, each participant could show how strong, courageous, active and resourceful he was.
After the sports games, everyone gathered in the outdoor dance where the holidays began.
At that time there was also a "children's wheel", where little ones could get out in the exciting attractions and get a new image in the front of the grill.
The new thing that could also become a tradition was a vehicle debt where both tractors and motorcycles were given.
Everyone spoke of the Inga Kadíķe-Skadiņa, the head of the municipality of Kūlciem, who was late for a nice rest and dry time, but the rain fell, but it was not able to interfere.
Celebrations continued with the greeting of the youngest inhabitants of Kūlciem.
Indeed, it is good that the village has been complemented by five girls and one boy.
The performances to the cheerleaders had arrived in amateur classes from the Engures novade - the audience liked the performances of the older dance band "Rounds rhythms", the different folk dance performers "Reds" and the young dancers "Gold Pearls".
And there's nothing that happened to be going on a wet stage.
Of course, local people and villages were delighted to receive the famous stakeholder duet, Janis Jaran and Danis Porgants, who were once again Mildinas Nabinas and Clairīte Kraninias, as well as the attractive wives of Bürzciem from the fishing site "Days".
Balli played Bruges.
The United Kingdom must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Winterfell.
Not only will he promote prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Hitler very attractive, as it did in London in 2012, where we invested a huge amount of work so that all the national regions could benefit from the Olympics.
Stratford and Istanda won an enormous deal from the Olympics.
And we will do it again by providing local citizens and businesses with business opportunities close to Hitler.
To the local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and finally add points to youth unemployment in the Hitrov area.
As in the 2012 London Olympics, there will also be people who will believe that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Hitler is too vast.
At that time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics and that it would be the world’s end.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012 and would not be fair in the case of Hitler.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hithrova has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympic Games, Hitrova is an infrastructure project that benefits the entire society, not individual.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating both employment and experience at this airport and throughout Britain.
A great team is working in Belarus, which has created an investment programme of worth 11 billion worth of infrastructure, including in time and budget starting with terminal 5, which has been called the best airport terminal in the world for five years and ending with terminal 2, which is built between the two most intensively used routes in the world.
Now they are ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by private investments of 16 billion pounds.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure that this will be the case with the expansion of Hitler.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Hitler by ensuring our future of trade and creating a new employment environment for Britain to be proud of.
Lord Paul Deiton is a member of the Board of the Hitrov and former Secretary of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman appears on the highway trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he was killed on the highway.
The police are trying to find the Witnesses in an accident when on Thursday mornings they crossed a number of cars on the highway.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morges in Vo canton.
The Vo Canton police report said that because of a desperate desire to commit suicide, the woman was on her way to the darkness where several cars had hit her.
Trying to kill himself, the victims, 49-year-old Swiss, assembled several machines, including a heavy machine.
She's at the scene.
Several accident-related drivers have already given evidence, but others have not yet been identified, the police say, calling for the removal of the involved drivers and witnesses of the accident.
The case also initiated a criminal investigation, which is a logical step in this case, as told by lawyer Gilles Hofsteller by Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid coincidence?
The courtman adds: "This will be determined by the prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred in the last five years indicate that none of the drivers will be called responsible.
In both cases, the walker had gone out on the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not be expected that the walker would be in the middle of the night, the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was excused for noticing that in August 2014, she was taken by a man who slept in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Paijernas.
The court found that the 22 - year - old was drunk and later noticed that he was on the road.
The Court concluded that the police officer who was on his way to an accident was in an appropriate manner and the judge acknowledged that the man lying on the road was "insurmountable and extraordinary".
Anyone who has information about the incident on Thursday near Morges is invited to contact the police by telephone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Collect signatures on the internet to arrange a new VID driver's job.
The opening of a signature on the petition portal "Avaaz.org" for the opening of a new National Revenue Service (VID) competition.
The petition addressed to the Ministers of National Unions (NA) and Green and Agricultural Unions (ZZS) states that the company wants a transparent and professional appointment process for officials.
The petition was created on August 10 and is currently signed by 55 people.
The process for the appointment of the Director-General of the VID is transparent and non-professional.
This recalls the best traditions of the Union officials of the Council.
This discredits public administration and keeps the public hope in the government and politicians on the ground.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria to be assessed by all candidates," the petition text says.
Its author, Jānis B., pointed out that the public does not know the criteria of how Koljegova was elected.
Nor is it clear what the candidates intend to do in the VID.
The petition states that a new, open invitation to tender should be opened for the State Office, where professional candidates are actively spoken, staffing specialists are involved and a corresponding remuneration is offered.
Last week, Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially appointed Koljegova as Head of the VID, this week he was scheduled to be approved by the government in a new position, but all the party ministers voted against, so the matter was postponed for a week.
Samilov: If we lost, I played bad.
Pludmal volleyballists Aleksandr Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdīņš were hoping for glory in the Olympics of Riodežanier, but there was no difference in where to finish the race, after leaving the tournament Samoilovs said.
One of the world's most powerful beach volleyball couples in the final and decisive tournament of the sub-groups on Thursday with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost Brazilians to Evandra Gonzalveš Oliver and Pedro Solberg Salgad, concluding their participation in the four-year most important sports forum.
In the three sub-groups, Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same relationship was still between two couples.
The relationship between the three pairs of small points was listed below, which was the most adverse to the Latvian duet after the strong loss in the match.
"In the first set we were in charge, but from 16:15 we also stayed at 16 points," the game went on.
I don't even know how we left the rest of the set without points.
It must not be played.
Then in the second set, everything was in order and the set ended up breaking the game, and it should also have been a good foundation for the third set.
We started it in a similar way, but after we got together with the parties, the result grew only for one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
All teams in the subgroup were similar, almost all cats had three sets, so small points were important.
"I should have played a more similar game, rather than giving back 3-4 points in a row," said the sportsman.
We knew that Evandra could be observed.
"In the first set we met with it at the end, in the second we entered 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he was already in the game," Šmēdīņš recalled.
We tried to show the best game.
The moment he came, the moment he didn't.
I did not see the overall situation before the match, but it was known that there were as few points as possible.
"If we lost, then I played bad," Samoilov said.
We waited for a good servant from Evandra, and in the first set we met quite well, but in the third, he opened a servant and was difficult to build an attack.
On the other hand, I made many mistakes directly at the Pedro Service, but it had to be done.
Samilov told me that contrary to the previous match today, sportsmen were not nervous.
"We went, we played, too, protection was, however, needed better service," said the athlete.
"They played well and at the end they were already on the "early"".
Before the tournament, we said that the lotus was the most uncomfortable that could have been.
We also had the opportunity to fight for the first place, but we did not even leave the group.
"All of us were expecting medals, and so were we, but then there are no more differences - 25th place or fourth," said Samolilov, who predicted that the duet will continue to play together in the future.
I think it won't be and we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samilova Riodezaneiro was already in his third Olympic career because in 2008 in Beijing he started with Martina Plaviņa, but four years ago he played with Ruslana Sorokin in London.
In the meantime, this was the second start at the Olympics.
"Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market also from the position of potential trader.
State energy company Latvenergo follows the process of opening the gas market from both the consumer and the potential trader's position, said the company's press secretary, Ivita Bidere.
"The decision whether to join the Latvenergo gas market as a trader in the future will determine which gas market model and legal framework will be set up."
"That is why we are actively involved in the drafting and commenting of legislation on our part, and we are also presenting our proposals," Bidere said.
BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economics (EM), in cooperation with the Public Services Regulatory Commission and the energy company "Latvijas Gáze", has developed a draft of the Cabinet rules on Natural Gas Trade and Use, which will change the existing principles of the functioning of the natural gas market, with the possibility of free choice of natural gas traders as from 3 April 2017.
In working with the new regulation of the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the natural gas trading process as simple as possible and understandable to the user.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service option, a "trader central model" is chosen, where all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one bill and one place of provision of information and customer service, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trade.
It should be recalled that, after 3 April 2017, household users who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue receiving natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In such a case, the obligation to supply natural gas to users at a regulated price is set for the public trader," the Ministry informed.
On the other hand, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas trading agreement.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trading contract, traders will be provided with natural gas trading for a period of time at its fixed price.
The draft rules of the Cabinet of Ministers set out in detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, the system operator and users.
The rules shall lay down the arrangements for the supply and suspension of natural gas to users, the safe use of the natural gas system, the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the gasified object owner's rights and obligations in the supply and use of natural gas; the arrangements for the payment of the services received, the rate of delay, the rate of change of the traders and the supply of users in the event of disruption of natural gas supply; the arrangements for the provision of natural gas to users related to the supply of natural gas by the public trader.

The Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Agricultural Union (ZZS)) is planning to speak next week with Prime Minister Māri Kučinski (ZZS) and government coalition partners on the increase in the remuneration of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
Traveller-Ozola pointed out to reporters on Friday that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the Director-General of the VID had to be addressed urgently in order to make this position more attractive to the candidates for the re-election.
The following week, too, we discussed changing the terms of the invitation to tender.
The Minister also stressed that she did not consider any particular candidate to speak up for a vacancy.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the view that Inga Koljegova, the Head of the State Environment Service, had been a good Director of the VID.
On the other hand, with regard to the current Head of the SID, Daci Pelėko, who has expressed his willingness to apply for this position, the Minister reiterated the view that the new Director-General of the SID should be "looking from the side" and should not come from the SID structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the return of Saeima from vacation to move as soon as possible the amendments necessary for the reorganisation of the VID.
BNS has already reported that the Head of State Environment Service, Inga Koljegova, has submitted a proposal to the Finance Minister for Dani Reizniece-Ozolai (ZZS) to withdraw his candidacy as Director-General of the VID.
In her presentation, she said that it was not an easy choice, but during the last two weeks her neighbors have experienced serious emotional pressure, although they have not done any acts that are punishable by law.

It was also reported that at the end of June, the former Director General of the VID, Ināra Peterson, had left the post.
Oil prices continue to rise; stocks in the US and Europe are increasing, as well as the value of the US dollar.
The oil prices in the world continue to increase on Friday morning, with the positive impact of investors' mood on the statements of the Ministers of the Arab Affairs of Saudi Arabia, which reinforces the expectation that the largest oil beneficiary countries will take action at the OPEC meeting in September to stabilise the world oil market.
The three main U.S. stock exchange indices reached a record level on Thursday that had not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor on the market was the increase in the oil price and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The increase in the oil price and the strong financial performance of several companies also led to the increase of European stock exchanges on Thursday.
The US dollar value increased on Thursday against the euro, against the UK market and against Japan.
The price of crude oil delivered by the New York Stock Exchange in electronic commerce increased by $1.78 on Thursday to $43.49 per barrel.
The purchase price of Brent's brand of crude oil in the London Stock Exchange increased by $1.99 - up to $46.04 per barrel.
The turnover of the preserved producer "Zilė laguna" was less than 33.8% last year.
The turnover of the conservative producer "Zilė Laguna" was 4,202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than a year ago, while the company's losses decreased 5.7 times - up to 904.7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial report published in the Lursoft database.
The company management report states that in 2015 the company was working on losses resulting from several reasons, including in connection with the persistent lack of funds to be traded caused by the withdrawal of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market by interrupting the previous credit line and leaving the Blue Lagoon with closed contracts without being able to execute them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient resources to buy cheaper raw materials in large quantities and to receive a discount.
The departure of the bank concerned from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing the European Union Structural Funds projects that would have enabled the factory to purchase new production equipment and modernise infrastructure.
The company’s financial creators also had a negative impact on the price increase of raw materials in the year of the transfer and the refusal of customers to pay more than the company’s manufactured goods.
"Only on the second half of July 2016 customers recognized price changes and were ready to buy goods at the new - highest - prices," the company management said.
In 2015, "The Blue Layer" also began negotiations with potential investors, including the valuation of the company's movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been with the company's largest Unicredit Leasing creditor, where the parties have become aware of and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s activities and development had a positive impact on the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimization of technological processes to achieve greater productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment was purchased that ensures greater production speed," the company's management indicated.
The management of the Blue Lagoon notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's factory to comply with orders that have not yet been possible.
The first batch to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the sales of the product have already been signed, all the products will be sold in accordance with the sales of the product.
The new product will increase turnover by around 300 thousand euros a month," the company's management points out.
The company is also planning to sign a cooperation agreement on supplies of fish production to Iraq in August 2016.
In 2016, the "Blue Lagoon" sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the market to Cyprus, and this September will sign a cooperation agreement with the new US wholesale chain.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase turnover.
In 2014, "Zilė Laguna" worked with €6.347 million in turnover and €5.113 million in losses.
The "Green Layer" is established in 1997 and its core capital is EUR 1,156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian private persons - Mikhail Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igor Širšon (10.89%).
Welcome to 15 p.m. to the museum to await the cinema live by Zaru Leanderi and to attend the press conference.
Riga can be regarded as a city of the beginning and inspiration of the divine cinema live by the career of Zaras Leander.
The home of Zaras Lendere at the cross mother Ruth, who was a Swedish ambassador to Latvia, was considered fateful in Riga in 1924, because she had just discovered the unusual low contrast of the woman of Zaras Leander, who tried to debut at the theatre theatre in Riga.
Perhaps it was in Riga that the accident became a fateful turning point in the creative way of Zara against the world’s fame.
Riga Zārai Leanderei bound herself with warm memories, and she hoped to visit Riga’s shows, but unfortunately these hopes were not fulfilled because World War II began.
Using the presentation form, this meeting will be possible in Riga in 2016 and the excellent role of Zaras Leander will be played by the great Ieva Kerēvica.

If Insurance has paid a travel insurance fee to a family on Wednesday, the cancelled flight at Riga Airport on 10 August, which resulted in the cancellation of the intended visit to the music festival.
On 11 August, if an application for remuneration was received from a client.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but since it was not possible due to cancelled flights at the airport on Wednesday, the customer was paid for booking accommodation that could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the tickets purchased for the festival amounting to EUR 204.
On the other hand, the airline has promised customers the money they spend on the flight tickets.
If Insurance for all travel insurance premiums has paid on average 15% of the compensation for cancellation or cancellation.
"In such cases, expenses are reimbursed for the purchase, delivery or exchange of tickets, as well as for the booking of accommodation," says Dagnija Rutka, head of the insurance product if Insurance Persons.

Because of the repair of the neighborhood, the man is at the broken edge and forced to leave home.
In the LTV broadcast "4studija", Dmitrys Saidjaševs, whose neighbor started repairing the capital in his apartment, and since that time Dmitri has been drowsy from the thresholds and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out arbitrary construction and my apartment has damaged borders.
Then I informed the Riga Building Authority, the house manager and other organizations.
The Building Authority said that we are not an operational service and we have no expert.
"The owner of the apartment must go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be an expert from there," says Dmitrys.
The requested expert has arrived, has fixed the incident and has recognised that the overlap is in an unsatisfactory situation.
However, since Dmitry’s first submission to the construction board, the month has passed, and by the beginning of this week, no one has been able to answer whether the apartment is in danger of life.
The government said - such is legislation, wait if you're not satisfied, write to everyone in order.
"Then I wrote to the Riga House, but they transferred the house to the manager, then the manager again to the building manager, and then there's a highway," says Dmitry.
After all the examination of the stack of papers, it is clear that the construction work has been stopped, although it is always possible to hear that someone is working there.
During another two months, expertise must be carried out and within six months, the owner of the apartment who performs the repair work should have all these defects removed.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the construction manager considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal structure in this non-existent structure is affected and therefore there is no doubt that the owner of the lower apartment is in danger.
"That's why we've asked for an additional explanation from this expert," says Ilze Zuka, representative of the city of Riga.
Despite the ban on any repairs to the upper apartment, we still hear that the building continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a building permit is EUR 70 to 700, but in a particular case the penalty may be more severe.
While the expert’s opinion is expected, the building manager decided that both apartments must not operate - both in the construction site and in Dmitry’s apartment.
"This has not been the case in the case of the owner of the property in this way, because of his ignorance or simply a lack of will, it is possible that people have created a threat not only to their property but also to the owner of the property, as a result of which the owner cannot operate his property," the representative of the company.
Now Dmitri leaves to find another place where to live - with relatives, friends, hotels, or rent another apartment.
But the resulting losses Dmitrys may try to get away from the neighborhood in a civil order that can take a lot of time.
Because of arbitrary construction, staying in both apartments is currently prohibited until the construction manager will conclude, and it may have to wait even three weeks.
The resulting losses will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment where the repair work has taken place.
The owner of this apartment is also threatened by a prison sentence for up to six months because the construction authority has not taken into account what has been said.
Take it now!

The conversion of the former Chemer sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The conversion of the former Chemer sanatorium to the Park Hotel Kemeri will cost 22 million euros, the agency tells LETA the managing director of the floating hotel SIA, representative of the Park Hotel Kemeri, Gita Zelve.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of restoration of the former Chemer sanatorium.
The second stage will be "wellness" or a well-being clinic, which is planned to open in 2022, while the opening of the hotel is scheduled for May 2018.
Zelve notes that the exact costs of the clinic are not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be found in the former Chemer resort polyclinic building, which is about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
Park Hotel Chemeri and the designated clinic owner is the international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are several investors who invest money in this fund, Zelve points out.

It has already been reported that the restoration of the cultural park in more than 42 hectares area, the restoration of roads and streets, the construction of an interactive natural tourism facility, the improvement of the territory and the construction of the parking space in Emile Dārsins Street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of the city of Jūrmala and the increase in the number of tourists, the Jūrmala Council plans to allocate EUR 14.5 million from the funds of the European Union, co-financing with between EUR three and four million.
By mid-2017, design works will begin in the autumn of the following year.
According to the report, in the historical sanatorium complex "Kemeri" is planned to form a charming hotel "Park Hotel Kemeri" and "wellness" or a well-being clinic.
However, the reconstruction is extended.
In 2010, however, it was further stated that "Ominasis" was regularly communicating with the hotel operator Kempinski, which continues to provide daily technical control at the Kempinski Sanatorium, and already in 2011 was "completed the construction of the Kempinski Kempinski Kempinski Kempinski Kampinski Kampinski Kampinski Kampinski Kampinski Kampinski Kampinski Kampinski Kampinski Kampinski Kampinski Kampinski Kampinski.
In October 2014, the company's willingness to buy an insolvent Ominasis Latvia was confirmed in the auction by Park Hotel Kemeri, but a month later, the auction was declared not to happen because the winner had not paid for the purchase at the time.
The selling price was determined at the starting price of the last unsolicited tender - EUR 2.86 million.
As the agency LETA informed the city council representative Ieva Aile, the municipality, by signing the protocol, confirmed that the co-financing of the European Union's structural funds will create interactive natural tourism facilities, routes and parking lots, in the restored historic chemer park.

Former NATO commander Brydlova's e-mail hackers broke up in Russia.
Hackers who broke down the U.S. National Democratic Committee (DNC) computers, possibly after several other cyber attacks, also broke up the servers of the Open Society Institute, the business news agency Bloomberg, the former commander of NATO European forces, and George Soros.
Hackers have published information on DCLeaks.com.
Among other things, there is also a list of Brídlova and information about the work of the Soros Institute.
For hackers, computers have been available for a full year.
According to Bloomberg news, these cyberattacks were the same hackers that broke down the DNC e-mails.
The Wall Street Journal, on the other hand, reports that the US President Barack Obama's administration is currently considering the issue of new sanctions for Russia, thus responding to the collapse of the DNA computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have to charge the servers of the Democratic Party with officially cyberattacks supported by Russia or the Russian authorities.
As reported, the WikiLeaks website published about 20,000 e-mails in July, which were obtained from the DNC computer system and of which it is clear that the leaders of the Democratic Party have tried to harm the presidential election of the party candidate Hilaria Clinton, former Sanctent Senator Vermont.
According to U.S. press sources, the Federal Investigation Office, which is conducting an investigation into the collapse of democratic servers, as well as other US experts, considers Russia's connection to cyber-attack is beyond doubt.
Makartney: Noko Ono's presence threatened "The Beatles".
Paul Macartney acknowledged that the presence of Joko Ono created a sense of the threat of the legendary group "The Beatles".
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains "good" relationships with the unlucky John Lennon, but at the time she went to visit the group at the entry study, she feared Margarten because Ono was the only woman in the group between George Harrison, Ringo Star, Lenona and Margartnia.
When the singer asked about both relationships, he said to the magazine Rolling Stone, "It's really good."
At that time, we felt threatened.
As we entered, she sat on the amplifiers.
Most groups could not bear it.
We were able to do this, but not quite successfully, because we were very tense.
We weren't sexists, but the girls usually didn't come to the studio, they let us work.
When John started to meet Yoko, he did not sit in the control room but in the middle of four of us.
The author of the poet Yellow Submarine also acknowledged that he is now regularly communicating with the former band member Ringo, and is periodically approving the work plans of the recording studio Apple, but otherwise "The Beatles" is "beginning to work".
Asked if he was still meeting with another still alive legendary hand group member, Marartney told Rolling Stone: "Often not."
We meet in social events and in the ballet.
However, I did not go to the meetings, and I felt a little out of it.
I left Apple during a severe separation.
At my place of meeting, I sent John Wystman and said, "Tell me what everyone says, because I can't stand sitting at his table."
It was too painful to see our pet dying.
The company is now working so that I will only listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus has once been a living planet
On the basis of NASA's latest climate models, Venus has once been a living planet.
NASA Godard Space Research Institute has developed a model to explore Venus history using tools and algorithms that climate scientists also use.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot with no water and whose atmosphere consists almost only of carbon, when conditions have been similar to Earth.
Scientists have already mentioned that the slow speed of Venus is explained by the dense atmosphere.
However, recent simulations show that Venus once had a plane, an atmosphere similar to the Earth, and it will turn slowly.
The model also looks at Venus' previous topography.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there was enough water and geographical diversity to create life and prevent water from being drained.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent hotter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the Venus cutting model reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts for 2 months, explained in the press release by GISS scientist Antonius Del Genio.
This process warms the surface of the planet and causes a thing that, in turn, forms layers of thick clouds that act as rain protection by protecting the planet from the heat of the sun.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution that scientists have developed in their hypothesis.
Although it was once habitable, for several billion years Venus was subjected to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans were burned down, and the lungs were burned by ultraviolet rays.
When the water is completely boiled down, only a plane's carbon atmosphere with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, which we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the magazine Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy withdraws from Coach Avalanche
On Thursday, Coach Colorado "Avalanche" and Vice-President Patrick Roy of the hockey operations submitted a request, as a reason for mentioning, insufficient impact on the team's decision-making process.
The Colorado Vice-President and General Joe Sakiks confirmed this message and informed that the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been energetic, exciting and objectively fulfilling my duties as the main coach and vice-president of the Colorado hockey club," said 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
During this summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve the team's performance in order to give it the heat it needs and achieve a higher level of results.
In order to achieve this, the visions of the Vice-President of the main coach and hockey operation must be fully coincided with the visions of the organisation.
It should also have the potential to affect decisions relating to the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakiks, who took his place on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Said Patrick informed her of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the good of the organization and we want him to do everything he wants to do further.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the best coach in the league and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and the first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of exclusion, the Colorado team won the Minesotas hockeyists. Since then, the club has not been in the exclusion games for two years.
Avalanche concluded the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and left five points behind the Wild team without obtaining the second special invitation from the Western Conference organizers.
Famous Medieval Guard Roys fought four Stanley Cups in his career -- two with Montreal's "Canada" and two with "Avalanche".
North Sea oil platform workers resume negotiations and leave the strike
Staff strike on the remuneration of North Sea oil platform workers has been delayed because the two parties to the dispute have resumed negotiations, the leaders of the news negotiations.
On a regular basis, strikes against the Oil Processing Company Wood Group are held on the North Sea Oil Platforms in which Royal Dutch Shell operates.
The Joint Communication states that Wood Group and Unit and RMT have agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled for next week to begin with the aim of re-examined issues.
The trade unions reported that their recent measures, organised after more than 25 years of interruption, were aimed at a 30% reduction in the wages planned.
Due to the negative market pressure, Wood Group this year reduced the salaries of North Sea workers by 9 per cent.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the salaries of land workers by 10 per cent.
The company explains that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive market declines.
On the other hand, Shell has already reduced the salaries of a number of thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimize its work in the preparation of a large-scale merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies feel pressured by the falling oil prices, and the situation is becoming more difficult for the UK to abandon the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Mr Anderson, Member of the Scottish Parliament, met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - North Sea strike plans.
He said the North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
In his report he explains that the North Sea and the State are in general in need of an economy from which everyone, not individual, would benefit.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost $1.4 billion compared to $7 billion invested in the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the Pleiades star.
The latest Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of star speed in the Pleiades star.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars are spinning at different speeds in this star, as well as how the speed of star rotation relates to the formation of planets.
"We hope that when we compare our results with other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass, age and even the history of the solar system," said the scientist Luis Rebula of Pasadena's Caltech Infrared Process and the Analytical Centre.
The rising star is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star are only beginning to grow at about 125 million years of age.
They're spinning at maximum speed.
At the maximum speed, these rising stars emit large amounts of star wind.
When the wind arrives in the magnetic field, they brake the stars.
As stars grow older, their rate of rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of each star's rotation by setting the time between a recognised star area, such as the solar plane.
The latest star speed catalogue shows that larger stars turn slower than smaller stars.
The rebellion compares stars to dancers, larger growth dancers perform pyruettes slower than small growth dancers.
Rebul says that the Ballet of Pleiades shows that slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, while faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the closeness of the Pleiades star, it serves as a great space laboratory where stars can be compared to speeds of rotation.
Rebul says that the Pleiades star helps to form theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for both parents and younger stars.
We still need to learn a lot about how, when and why the speed of star rotation slows down and about their complete stopping process.
Rebul and his colleagues presented in detail an analysis of the speed of the turn of the Pleiades stars in three new publications, which will soon be published in the journal Astronomy.
