Dodson suspects that she has been using J. Y. Y. Y., notably the King of Tutankhamun's annual share.

Mark Gaboldy, who believed that Meritatton was the king of Neferfurruaton, may have been the most trusted man in the world.
The first name proposed for King Neferfurraton is Nefertity.
Later, Mark Gaboldy, a French prosecuting officer of Egypt, mentioned that some of the pieces found by Tutankhamun’s shohonga were originally for Neferfuruatan.

If her entire structure had been restored, it would mean that she had become the father of Nebuchadnezzar instead of Nefertiti.
The name Neferty is Neferfurraton.
