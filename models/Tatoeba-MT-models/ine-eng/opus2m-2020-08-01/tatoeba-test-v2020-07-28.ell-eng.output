I don't think I'm ready for the investigation.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
They'll fix it.
We don't have a school tomorrow.
Rome wasn't built in one day.
I like dancing.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We didn't have secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're much faster than me.
Tom lives in Australia now.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that.
Good morning.
Do you like the juice?
You seem disappointed.
Tom knows all about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We're laughing a lot.
Tell me what you're gonna take in the exams.
I don't think two languages are enough.
Can you lend me your car tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter's a nurse.
I think we should tell them.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church with the car.
You're much smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's coming home at 3:00.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I won't lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
The only fish is not my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a high school student.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with that.
They're lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
It's okay?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I know where you're working?
Can anyone explain that to me?
Who is she?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We've washed the house green.
The time and place for the meeting have been closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I've been promoted recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please, close the door.
Heart is doing good in health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary he had to.
What would you tell her to do?
He's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want anything to eat.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I'm sorry.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
Everything that lights is not gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
It hits my phone.
Throw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom is a head taller than me.
Where can we buy it?
Now it's 2:30.
Everyone knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was in his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadian.
Who's that?
Tom forgot his bag on the train.
They killed our cows.
My name isn't Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a hippie community.
The water's hot.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch you.
It was an emergency.
You're wearing expensive scissors.
Has anyone come?
Tom is the only Canadian here.
Tom will live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canada?
People today attach more importance to popular culture than to the past.
Tom's not my friend anymore.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you wash your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We love each other.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
Did you shoot him?
We may need some.
This is a proposal.
How was your vacation?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
Have we been invited?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find you.
Do they call you?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house is completely destroyed.
Tom caught Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who he is?
Did you see the baseball on TV last night?
Mary photographed her mother with her cell phone.
I wanted to die.
It does the same to me, whether it comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about money.
Would you like to see them?
You ruined him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like humans.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I'm not gonna be late.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
Are you 18?
I want to do sports.
Tom was alive.
Dhoma's phone hit him, but he didn't know it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was off-balance.
About.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myth?
He's closed 40.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
The Captain has defined us well.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw it with love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not being read.
Tom hugged Mary.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build a store?
What do you call that?
Larry's still at school.
My office is in the center of town.
He's got two sisters.
You're not a Canadian.
I visited Boston years ago.
Tom rejected Mary.
Tom has a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We stayed in Boston for three nights.
I'm starting to find you tired.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom's wearing gloves.
The letters are written by the girl.
Someone's got an earring.
He didn't go to the lake.
He speaks French properly.
I'm taller than you.
Have you lost the evidence?
Are you afraid you won't lose your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom will be back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your ears?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm unconcerned.
I think Tom's drunk.
Tom is your teacher.
The news made him happy.
We were enemies.
Who's got him?
We don't have anywhere to go.
How many squares can you see?
This bus goes to the art museum.
We're in Boston.
He lives in Dubai.
I don't know what you're looking for.
They're big?
Tom's from Boston.

The cat's under the table.
We can't tell you.
He doesn't see any TV.
I'm the coach.
Tom's gonna work this afternoon.
Who is she?
Get some breakfast.
He hit the teacher.
I thought Tom liked the gypsies.
I don't have any money with me.
He'll be watching you.
Tom and Frank are good friends.
How was Boston?
Tom claims he can speak French.
Tom knocked on the wall.
We're too busy.
Stronger, please.
You're mine.
Please breathe from your nose.
The company canceled the plan.
"Fire!" he called.
He worked hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm gay.
You're easy.
Tom's not a hero.
I'm happy to be able to help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys aren't mine.
She was the last customer.
Do you like white wine?
They made a mistake.
I say it and I say it again.
Open the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
Do you learn Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
This will never happen again.
Russia is big.
The teacher is friendly.
You ruined her.
I'm sorry, I can't sit here for a long time.
I'm Harvard's student.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
You can't do anything.
I don't want you to tell her.
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston.
What brings you here?
I did that I was asleep.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
The snow shook the visibility.
Don't apologize.
Thomas bought something.
He's got a house.
The girl has a white horse.
Tom's a little jealous.
I still want to marry you.
Now's your chance.
You can choose whatever book you want.
Where are your clothes?
Tom's not a Canadian.
I'm talking.
The best way to learn English is to go to America.
Did you think I was Canadian?
I'll be with you.
I haven't received an answer in my letter.
Can I borrow your credit card?
Is everyone ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I'm reading it.
I want to talk to Tom.
You shot him.
Tom is Turkish.
Can you get rid of the six?
Don't stop!
I'm the only one who didn't have to.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
He's smart.
When do you leave for vacation?
It's Anita's house.
Tell her it's urgent.
He likes to play football.
How old were you when you left Australia?
There's no salt left.
Tom gave us some apples.
Let's be honest.
I'm going to Athens.
I know.
I broke into tears.
He's talking like a truck.
When do you read?
He hasn't answered yet.
Where's the money?
I bet he doesn't tell the truth.
I don't agree with you.
No one could have imagined it.
It'll be hard.
I want to be an actor.
When I was sick, Tom came and made dinner for me.
I would like to speak all the European languages.
The seventh is considered a lucky number.
Where are your suits?
I can't tell you for sure what's going on.

I'm not tired at all.
They're red.
He said something.
Ever since I got married, I've been out of work.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a horse?
I'm grateful he's done it.
And I'm kind of tired.
Are you sure you don't see things?
Don't apologize.
He's walking late.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
Is his father Japanese?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you hit the last button?
Tom was dangerous.
What time do they start?
I'm on my way now.
I'd think about it.
Tom is from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
That would never happen in Boston.
I like playing piano.

Who cares?
Tell me what you want.

Tell Tom I went fishing.
All right, try again.

All visitors have left.
Who killed Tom?
I'm proud of my brother.
Take them with you.
Come out.
I wish I had been born in Canada.
You're impatient.
You're impatient.
What did you promise to do?
I did not participate in the debate.
Note: In English we praise nationalities, days of the week, and languages.
Tom loved me.
You were guilty.
I trust you.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build stores?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
My name is Kirillos. I'm happy to meet you.
He's got good feet.
His current behavior confirms what we're supposed to do.
You'll eat.
The problem is you're not a Canadian.
We're not happy.
Tom's asleep.
Is he coming?
Tell us where to go.
Sam's drunk and he's in the Lyle's bathroom.
When I grow up, I'll be a pilot.

How much do you want to pay?
Aren't you happy?

Do you feel tired?
It's still raining, isn't it?
I left for London.
I love dogs.
Are you afraid of losing your money?
It's cold; why don't you wear a sweater?

Would you like to see them?
The birds are red.
Find me a glass.

Whenever I hear this song, Tom comes to mind.
We circled for an hour trying to find the hotel.

I'm over thirty.
Don't put sugar in the coffee.
I'd like you to stay with me.

The girls were looking at each other.
Brazil is the largest country in South America.
I like running.
Samma's talking about your own safety.
I never eat meat.
Dispersions do not need to correspond to a natural quantity. Anything that can be a dispersal space is enough to define the addition between dispersions and multiplication with a degree of size.
His money's in the bank.
I'm very shy.
I love my country.
We went into a serious discussion.
They're here.
I guess someone likes Tom.

"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to."
You were guilty.
I'd like to see the party.
As Tom hit the phone, Tom woke up.

Who shot them?
She's writing to me all the time.
Take it.
Too bad you couldn't come.
Write something.
It took me three hours to drive from Boston here.
Tom pushed his nose into the window.
You're less than me.
She's eating.
I need your car.
Tom thinks Mary killed John.
I'll find them.
I arrived at 2:30.
You might be right.
The oxygen is necessary for the combustion.
Is everything okay?
You're unbelievable.
Tell her I'm innocent.
My brother lives in Boston.
What are you reading?
Okay, thank you.
Only I can save you.
Where's a bakery?
Tom was borrowing money in Mary.

Where's the cook?
The experiment failed.
More.

Tom saw her.
It wasn't Tom who killed Mary.
You're alive.
You believed me.
This is my daughter.
I was talking to Tom.
She must be sick.
I'm shy.
We'll make a visit to our friends.
I don't know.
And talking about genocide, today's Columbus Day.
Sam hired another camera.
I want some orange juice.
The entrance of the toilet is very dirty.
Is Tom from Boston?
Do we really have to leave now?
Would you like some coffee or tea?
Tom, I'm afraid we'll find our ball.
Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of poems.
They voted.
He wrote the book.
I haven't given it to Tom yet.
You're still alive.
I'll never forget this night.
I don't know if I have time.
I hope to see them.
I'm not going to reveal her secrets.
Mary answered the teacher's question.
Tom said he thought I was impressed.
I drink at least once a month.
I want some cheese.
He shot her.
I don't know the Arabic alphabet.
Answer the question.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
I'll be in the car.
What is the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I lost the last two lessons.
I'd like him to give me an explanation.
Where did you learn to speak French?
Tom failed.
Open your book on page ten.
This elevator is out of operation.
There were so many people in the room that then I could move violently.
He'll visit his uncle.

Tom's got blue eyes.
How many tickets did you get?
If you're busy, I'll help you.

I'd like to cancel my ticket.
Who taught you French?
You're very attractive.
Come in, please.
I ate something.
Tom's leaving tomorrow.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
This book is too small.
I was very hungry.
Run!
Everybody started running.
When does Tom read?
We're gonna kill you.
You're old enough to do it yourself.
"What would you like?" "I'd like a dog."
You're working hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's really a good theory, the only disadvantage I think it's probably common in all the philosophical theories.
Why don't I stay surprised by that?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He spends a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm so nervous right now.
I thought you were Japanese.
There's a lot of mess here.
Who saw you?
They're bigger than her.
Please repeat what I say.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
Language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike's the tallest of all three.
Did you ask them to wait?
She's crying.
It'll work.
I guess you're Canadians.
Yeah, I know.
Will Tom die?
I'd like to go see a movie.
Many questions remain unrelenting.
I like Irish music.
Give me a box.
What's your height?
I wanted to be in Paris.
French is a difficult language.
I don't want to talk to Tom right now.
I should have a cup of tea.

Tell him your theory.
These apples are big.
I want soup.
Here?
Where did you find the key?
Could that not be right?
Tom can't stand the warm and wet summers here and that's why he went to the mountains.
Bill, pick up the phone at night.
I'll help you in any way I can.
Please tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
Isn't it Italian?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
There were a lot of porn magazines in his room.
Let's leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Thank you.
Are you awake?
Algeria is very different from the United States.
It wasn't a pleasant experience.
He teaches us French.
You're so beautiful you don't need a soft one.
Why do you want to go to Turkey?
He ran as fast as he could get his feet.
I like fishing.
I don't like these sweets.
The back door was broken.
I feel younger again.
Tom ate a orange.
You're the expert.
Tell him I'm ready.

It's from Greece.
Sometimes I understand you.
Tom was singing.
I love the taste of maniacs.
Tom hated Mary.
Where can I buy tickets?
I was hungry.
When are your birthdays?
I'm not your enemy.
I asked Tom to sign the papers.
Save them.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
I brought you something.
I made me sleepy.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We've suffered.
Tom was impressive.
Mary's being cautious with strangers.
We're gonna shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I came home.
Life is hard.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy you.
Tom pushed the door.
I live here.
I hope you call again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Talk to me later.
Put the book on top of the others.
The bird is in the sky.
Tom hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom married Canada.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
Who are you sending a message?

We only have three choices.
Selina's behind the clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.
Tom worked in Australia.

Thank you. You're fantastic.
Will Israel be attacked in Iran?
I like to laugh.
I was washing my shirt.

We forgot you didn't like pizza.
I got up early last night.
Tom's helping Mary.
He'll protect you.
Tom's driving.
My father is rich.
Are you new?
I remember that word.
I'll decide.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
It's not hard for the French.
Someone's shouting.
We found her.
Where are you going?
His hair was brown.
Everything repeats the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Steven's dead.
We can't stop you.
What languages do they speak in Switzerland?
Help me get him up.
Are they Japanese?
Why does he hate you so much?
Let Tom swim.
How long have you been a teacher here?
Try to stay real.
This is a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before dinner.
Are you drunk?
He tried to write a lecture.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?
I miss my father.
I want to tell you something.
He's using you.
He's not back in Okinawa.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why did you kiss her?
I hope the bus trip isn't boring.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
Tom stabbed Mary.
At first I couldn't understand it.

I like sports.

I'm weird.
I'll eat here.
This is a Japanese doll.
He took out his glasses.
It's good to dream.
He had a headache.
Which one is mine?
Tom doesn't speak French.

You underestimated me.
Finally symptomatic, these two are still under repair.

He was busy.
Get out of my office!
What would you advise me to do?
Tom doesn't hate you.
The computer you're using is slow.
I left the door open.
Tell him not to come.
He ate the whole apple.
I'm not kidding.
I'm kidding.
It's different.
I just moved in.

You're smarter than that.
I want this TV.

Tom's always willing to help.
Thank you guys for coming!
Tom and I are both Canadians.
We're students.
Does anyone know Japanese?

He was born rich.
This is a sign.

I'm playing violin.
Pick up your stuff and go.
You'll be surprised at what you can learn in a week.
I don't know where you're going.
I want a green one.
We have to get out of here.
They told me to wait here.
Why are you so sad?
Tom had to walk for school when he was a kid.
They robbed me.
Only we can save them.
I guess someone must like Tom.
It's always a lot of work.
You ruined him.
When did you get here?
I know myself very well.
We'll find one.
I told my friends.
I think we could help each other.
I live in Milano.
Tom wouldn't believe us.
Am I your friend?
I may admire other people, but I've never tried to be someone else beyond myself.
I don't trust women.
I suggest you read this book.
Can you find it?
Please correct the next proposal.
Tell me if I need to make some changes.
What is the most widely read book in the world?
In the evening, the iron clings.
Is this your book?

That's the goal.
My baby is crying very hard.
Can you take over here?
We need more coffee.

What are you gonna drink?
What color is your dress?
No one will know.

Aren't you going to Australia to build stores?
I like your shirt.
Tell them I'm ready.
I'm in bed.
Australia is a beautiful country.
Of course, every religion has its own rules.
I know where Tom was born.
Pull straight until you see the mail station and then turn right.
You don't have to talk so hard.
Tom's eating a lot.
There were so many people in the room that I could hardly move.
He'll walk.
You're ready.
We recognized her.
She's on diet.
You're sick.
Tom's a submissive.
I underestimated him.
Are you really Canadian?
All of a sudden, I started taking weight.
How many Canadian friends do you have?
That's Ala's book.
It was my wife's idea.
Tom wanted Mary.
I've got ten pens.
I appreciate that.

You told her.
Don't blow the dog's tail.
Tom's mad at us.
I bought you red roses.

Ask me tomorrow.
Tom tells me he doesn't care whether you like it or not.
To forgive others is an act of gratitude to yourself.
My goal is to learn your language.

What have you got?
I think I hear them.
My neighbor's name is Tom.
I visited Tom many times in Boston.

The Greeks have inspired the party, not for their literary work, but for their actors, to warn them to take a deep breath, as they were preparing for a coming big proposal; so a party represents a stop.

Tom contacted Mary.
Why did Tom buy a new car?
Tom was wearing a white shirt.
Tom would have defended me.
You were perfect.
How much do you want?
Dispersions do not need to correspond to a natural quantity. Anything that can be a dispersal space is enough to define the addition of dispersal and multiplication with a degree of size.

He buys the computer.
Can you make a vertical?
I like that shirt.
I'm talking to you.
The roses in my garden are beautiful.
I'll go with you.

We often make mistakes.
What if something went wrong?
I thought you were at work.
He likes the adventure.
Tom told Mary to get up.
The worst is over.
Tom just finished writing a letter to Maria.
There's a hospital near here.

I didn't want milk.
I'm not going to disappear.
Do you understand?
It's Sunday.
What are you gonna leave behind?
There's no fever.
Tom doesn't come here often.

I haven't tried.
There's a man at the door.
Where's Tom?

He may have changed.
I married a Canadian.
Tell her you don't need it.

The dog eats a apple.
Tom tried to calm his wife down.
You don't want to talk to me, do you?
A good dress ensures a meeting, but a good mind a real relationship
Who washed the car?
This probably affected their decision.
Tom is better in French than in English.
I remember.
Are you working Monday?
I don't know how much Tom gets out.
No one's sitting here.
Are you talking to me?
A small step for man, a giant leap for humanity.
You must hear the truth.
Tom knows you.
Give me three minutes.
Tom wants to stay here.
I'd like a orange juice.
I'm ironing my dress.
That's not true.
We need actions, not words.
Everyone went to the same bar.
Who's Tom talking about?
Tom told Mary he always lived in Boston.
There's a lot of roofs in Iceland.
We'd stay longer if we had more time.
Let's order two bottles.

Excuse me, what time is it?
It doesn't surprise me.
I'll give you Tom's address.
When did you come back from Tokyo?

First, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth ... last.
I don't remember how they put it on his kid.
I'll remember that.

First the migrants, then you, our solidarity response to social cannibalism.
Can you call this line?
Can you cool the cheese?
I don't like taking a risk.
Tell them to stop worrying.
Tom's taller than me.
Do what you think.
Stop there.
I'll talk.
Are you sure?
Her eyes were red from the cry.
Are you taller than Tom?
I went to the park with Mary last night.
I'm the only one who didn't have to.
He's awake.
I could have done it this morning.
I thought you were Canadian.
He doesn't even know how to write or read.
I'm sorry, what time is it?
We have three kids.
Tell them to help me.
Tom was dressed like a girl.
How much does the pants make?
I like my coffee to be warm.
Tell them we're busy.
I like the way you think.
Tom refused to listen.
When will he come home?
Tom's good at cooking.
It's disgusting.
Do you have a tattoo?
That's original.
"Should I help you?" "No, thank you, I'm just kidding."
Mary protected her wife.
You're not Japanese.
Son of a bitch!
Tom stayed calm.
They say you can usually judge people from the company they have.
We don't have anything.
My shoes are bigger than yours.
I'd like you to meet tomorrow.
We like music.
Can you slow down the tension a little bit?
I don't have a girlfriend.
The news made them happy.
I visited her in Germany.
Tom's already gone home, but Mary's still here.
Tom's drinking coffee.
We're not hungry.
We all made a mistake.
This weekend we can make free calls.
You don't have a brown eye.
I wanted to die.
Where's your wife?
Were you watching?
I can read without glasses.
Tell me your address.
We have everything we deserve.
Let's talk about that.
You don't trust me, do you?
My job is to teach English.
That brings me great pleasure.
Tell them I won't do that.
I like Boston very much.
I'd like to help you.
My lord's cutting me.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Try to convince him to help us.
Excuse me, do you speak English?
You're late yesterday.
We're students.
Why are they angry?
I hope it went well.
I'm human.
Everybody likes the money.
Tom's talking to Mary.
Tom did a lot of great things.
There are five fish in my tank.
Tom's not driving fast.
Thomas is smarter than Mary.
The pen's on top of the office.
Are you going to stay?
Tom and I are getting married in October.
Sit down!
I love the vegetables.
Who were you talking to?
You need to sleep.
Who broke it?
What's your complaint?
It's obvious Tom's busy.
Wait for me there.
Why don't you help me?
You think you can catch me?
Tom planted three apples in his yard.
Tom claimed he was innocent.
He's smiling.
Your face is red.
You're not ready.
Tom and Mary are coming here now.
You're not Canada.
He said something.
She advised him to take the medicine.
Tom is my oldest brother.
Don't underestimate me.
The couch's empty.
I'm a big soul.
Are you sure Tom's not busy?
Who's sick?
Thomas has a Turkish friend.
I like jazz.
Tom's got a brain.
Are you sure you've hit the right button?
Good evening!
Are you satisfied?
We sent the products yesterday.
You're gonna be jealous.
You have something in your teeth.
How often do you wash your clothes?
Tom has high moral standards.
I'm taking threats.
Tom wore his gloves.
Tom forgave Mary.
Tell them who we are.
You went to the casino.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake when you speak English.
I can't help you this week.
You don't have to say such things when there are kids around.
I'll never forget you.
I thought you were Canadians.
We recognized them.
I heard the news on the radio.
Do you miss Tom?
His wife doesn't even know why he died.
You need to see this movie.
Drive safely.
Tom knows I'm Canadian.
I lost my lunch card.
There was no time.
After the accident, the wounded were transferred to the hospital.
We have to finish it all by Monday morning.
We have to work very hard.
As you wish!
Who are your parents?
I played tennis.
And with the others, I don't like wearing pants.
We're going to make it clear that we're going to attend your party.
Thank you for coming!
Tom was singing.
He's a dancer.
What did you ask him?
He's running now.
She's very pathetic to me.
What I want now is a glass of cold water.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom's handling the French pretty well.
Why did you shoot her?
Let's keep going.
I want to talk to my lawyer.
She likes flowers.
I think they're liars.
This elevator can transport ten people in a moment.
Freedom is not free.

What are Tom's priorities?
Tom has a brother in Boston.
I want to talk to you.
Tom decided to go to Australia.
Tom didn't want to.
Tom taught Harvard.
It's getting cold; why don't you put on a sweater?

Are you ready?
For adults only.
I don't know.
Tom loved Mary.
He wanted to see his boss in Tokyo before he left for America.
Come early.
How many letters did you send to Tom?
I have months to see him.
I forgot her plug.
I want you to go back to Boston.
They're crazy.
You're a liar.
We're not guilty.
I drink milk.
I admire you.
I didn't go to the zoo.
These are my favorites.
One speaks English and the other Japanese.
When are you planning on getting married?
They write.
What can I do about it?
I can't imagine what it might mean to be there.
It was English.
I had no doubt.
I'm not tired at all.
She's beautiful.
What do you want me to tell you?
Tom doesn't eat red meat.
The streets are covered with snow.
Well, I have a proposal to make.
I don't remember the exact date.
He's smart.
What are you gonna say?
Stop smoking.
When do you eat dinner?
Would you like a glass of red wine?
He only drinks water.
I can't forget her beauty.
Do you wash your hands before you eat?
Tom's playing tennis.
Everyone has secrets.
Don't lie to me again.
I don't have a brake.
I like helping others.
What kind of animal is big?
I'll wait until October.
You know how to use it?
They're lucky.
The decision is mine.
You want to tell her?
You hid the truth from me.
His answer was negative.
I understand.
You're still alive.
How old are they?
Tell her not to come.
Is Tom really a Canadian?
Tom plays tennis every day.
It's not cheap.
She's a very attractive woman.

We'll die if we stay here.
Do you want to eat girls?
I have a friend.
She didn't understand Mary's joke.
Are you gonna tell them?
She's very glisterous.
Who brought you here?

Did we win?
I'm not very good at this.
Were you alone?

You think you could help me get the farm out of the garden this afternoon?
Is Tom hungry?
I'm ready to go.
Who died?
Tom runs every day.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary had made that decision.
You're Canadians, aren't you?
I have to tell them.
Have you read this book?
Tell them I'm not here.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
Right.
We're honest.
I woke up at 5:00.
Tell them we'll be ready.

Did you kiss?
We've been warned.

They're Canadians, aren't they?
I'll teach you French.

I'm eating.
Try to stay still.

I left the bank with empty hands.
Why don't you tell them?
She's asleep?

I'm going home today.
I have sunglasses.
We have the best food in town.
I had a tough year.
What do they want?

Read it and answer it.
Do you know where Holly is?
You should talk to Tom about it.
I don't think it's been three years.
Where did you find the keys?
Some people do vile things.
You don't listen.

Tell me your names.
What exactly did Tom do?
I'll meet you at the hospital.

Tell him I'm busy.
I wasn't sleeping.
He's been robbed of news.
Do you like snow?
This is Tom's.
When did you leave Harvard?
Do you want it?

You have to wait.
We need you here.
Tom said he liked the idea.
Tom just got back from Australia.
You want me to tell her?
This burning came from boiling water.
Mr. Jackson is teaching us French.
It's too big.
Please give me this book.
Did you buy a return ticket?
I touched her.
Don't leave me here alone.
You have to listen to me.
I'll wait for you at 2:30 here.
Do you know how to use it?
Ten minus two is eight.
I'm happy.
Why are you lying?
There are many words I don't understand.
We need to set things straight.

Were you happy?
You have to write a book.

We want meat.
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
I'll stay.

Open the box.
Are you home?

You can sit down if you want.
What's your favorite dessert?
Go ahead and make room for the others.

I haven't seen him lately.
They'll catch us.
Calm down!
Give me a little time.
Emily stole my heart.
Do you need sunglasses?
Does he speak English?
Tell them to come home.
Take them with you.
I'd like to see it.
We met him going there.
I have to tell him.
They're poisonous?
My selection will be next Saturday, 29 November 2014, at 10:30 a.m.
When did Tom get those shoes?
I don't know where Tom's pants are.
Tell them I won't do that.
I'm not very good at this.
I was hoping to see Tom.
We're all Canadians here.
Tom made some mistakes in the test.
Tom's cooking.
I was scared.
It's better to find out someone how to fish than to give him a fish.
I was so angry.
I get it.
Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom will obey.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.
It makes me laugh.
I'm at a friend's house.
Have you slept at all?

We know what the problem is.
I think it's unfair.
I'm Mexican, I speak Spanish.
I have a special relationship with my aunt.
I need your help.
Tom wanted me to know French.
What are Tom's chances of winning?
Tom doesn't need a lawyer.
You speak Spanish?
You're weak.
Where's the paper?
He went home with his feet.
Tom's gonna cry.
Where's he staying?
When are you coming?
We're ready to help.
Are you ready?
Let them not come.
That's not true.
The knife at the table wasn't cut enough to cut the meat, so I used my sushi.
Is that your car?
I kissed her.
Tom came here last night.
Who asked you?
We flew from Boston to Chicago.
Is this where the bus stops?
Stop him.

Tell her it's important.
I like singing.
Tom lost all his money.
How about Tom?
Tom has something to tell you.
How many hours did Tom work yesterday?
Why are we poor?
Tom's blind from the middle and above.
I hope they find Tom.
I'm expecting you from both of us.
Take them with you.
Give me your money.
What can you say in English?
French is not an easy language.
It's not my fault.
Can you answer that?
I have to be there before the seven.
How many oranges did Tom eat?
"What do you want to know?" "All of it."
Tom was still helping Mary.
Tom's going to graduate in October.

Close the window before you get out.
I wasn't at his funeral.
I didn't think it would be so easy to do that.
Wait a minute.
Tom's gonna catch Mary.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
I'm your doctor.
Look at that tall building.
The city's changed a lot since then.
These are ours.
Our team has good players.
I always put my team first.
I have many friends who live in Boston.
That's not a fish.
Emily's doing the lessons she's got about the house.
I like that kind of music.

The bathroom isn't very clean.
I teach Spanish.
I'd like to help you.
I didn't like it.
Cherries are red.
We were both very thirsty.
Why did you put red on the bag?
Tom and Mary remained good friends.
You speak any other language than English?
Tom's too late.
How often do you eat out?
I'm 19 years old.
When do you have birthdays?
Did you know Tom well?
I was in the right place at the right time.
Are you sure you hit the last button?
It's not hard to learn English.
The date will be set at a later date.
No one's coming.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I have a lot of things to do.
I punished them.
Your friend's here.
I'm thirty years old.
How was the beach?
You're Tom's daughters, right?
Tom had a glass of wine.
I've told you things I've never told anyone else.
Tom was wearing his hand.
She's very strange.
I like China.
Tom's smoking.
I'll never be as rich as Tom.
You're not a dog.
Do you like white wine?
He'll find it tomorrow.
I just said a big fool.
The house's broken.
Put the book in the office.
Can I see your birth certificate?
Tom can't tell you anything.
We need him.
Meat?
I saw you on TV.
I'm not your teacher.
I'll buy one.
I get it.
If you can, please follow me.
He started talking to the dog.
They all ran out.
They speak English and French in Canada.
It's stupid.
Tell them how important it is.
The party is Sunday.
We're all Canadians here.
Listen to him walk.
Did Tom send you?
Tom laughed.
I've lost my pen.
How is that word spoken?
He saved me.
I got an idea.
Where's the bank?
Don't get drunk.
I'm expecting your help.
It's almost 2:30.
What is it?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.
Tom has black circles under his eyes.
We weren't talking about Tom.
They trusted you.
You think this is a game?
I just finished the bathroom.
We're not gonna change anything.
Look what I did!
Tom is Harvard's student.
You have thirty days.
Tom bought a little gift to Mary.
Russian is a Slavic language, spoken as a mother tongue in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and is widely used, although without official recognition, in Latvia, Estonia and many other countries, which were the democracies of the former Soviet Union.
Tom said you were coming.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
I'm bigger than her.
Why don't you call them?
I'm still trying to find Tom.
"How many years are you?" "I'm twenty-three years."
Get some water.
I wish I had been born in Canada.
Are you sure you hit the last button?
We recognized them.
A lot of candles burned.
That's unfair.

We're close enough.
Tom took F to the gym.
Did you see who did it?
We're not millionaires.
Let's thank them.
You'll see the difference.
Don't tell Tom about the party.
I don't know why Tom's not here.
He never forgets his money.
It's almost 20 years old.
You have to stay.
I didn't vote.
Are you angry with Tom?
My parents live a strange life in Egypt.
He lost all his money in the casino.
I love green peppers.
You made the same mistake.
She said she had a good look.
What are you gonna say to Tom?
Thomas found me.
We're too busy.
I can live without water.
We've given your command the highest priority.
We make mistakes sometimes.
Could I use it?
They killed her.
My car's dirty.
I have to tell you the truth.
You never trusted me.
We don't know where Tom went.
Who's the boss now?
I'm pregnant.
Can you teach me some Welsh?
I'll show you how it works.
What did you say about us?
These are our children.
Dick's been trying hard to solve this problem.
I'm not Italian.

Are you sure Tom can do this?
Are you sure you don't remember?

Put 'em down.
Are you speaking Japanese?
Stop being upset.
Are you speaking my language?
Can we talk?

Tell her everything.
Tom's very conservative.
Fame doesn't work.
Put on a chair.
Only you can save me.
If Tom hadn't had this pillow, he'd be missing too much.
What's Tom gonna bring?
The mysticism has been translated into many languages.
Tom must be over thirty.
Help me get him up.
Tell them I'm ready.
Are you ready for tonight?

I don't remember when I first met him.
I'm starving.
I don't have anything to open the can.
Can I ask you a question?
How's the weather there?
I want to hire you.
Do you like running?
Are you engaged?
They don't understand French at all.
I'm expecting you two hours.
You're not paying attention.
I'm dancing.
Are you happy?
Hit the phone.
I'll open it.
We weren't careful enough.
You want to say it?
Let me talk, please.
They've lost everything.
You're invincible.
Tom's sleeping like a baby.
Come in, please.
Give me what you got.
I don't think I can go swimming today.
Tom was sentenced to a year of house limitation.
I don't have time to read books.
I hate liars.
Reject my request.
You're insubordinate.
I can't find him.
Don't you think you're going a little too far?
Your husband teaches me Italian.
How many apples you got in your neighborhood.
Who were you talking to?
Tell her I'll do it.
I'll be with Tom.
About 600 languages are in the process of disappearance because of the English.
Did you invite them to the party?
I didn't think it would be so easy to do that.
Are you new?
There was a big castle in my town.
He's in front of the door.
I think they're only going to Australia to have fun.
Tom's jaws are soaked.
I'm Richard.
What did you open him with?
Would you like a reservation for a trip to Australia?
I think she's sick.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
Tom will understand.
Where'd he kiss you?
They know us.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
Tom helped Mary.
I had my birthdays yesterday.
Tom has a Canadian passport.
Tell them I'm here.
Tom never asked me for money.
It helped me a lot.
Aeroplanes allow people to travel long distances quickly.
Don't you have anything better to do?
In my opinion, you are beautiful.
Let's all go home now.
With the rain it's stopped, the game is over.
Tom has my keys.
He looks happy.
We've been well prepared.
Were you happy?
Tom will forgive you.
You like putting me to sleep, don't you?
Is it running?
He's much smarter.
They'd hear us.
I got up early.
We'll have to wait.
I think he's my friend.
What did you do there?
The time will come when you will understand.
I'll eat it.
Tell her to stop.
I told him.
We're from Boston.
Does French Tom know?
These cars are being built in Japan.
Can I ask you something?
I work at a bank.
We'll stop you.
The superheating of the planet is in motion to turn the tops of the mountains into plain rocks into less than one sand.
"You did this Monday?" "No, I didn't."
Tom's smiling.
He loves Tom, not me.
I'm pretty strict with that.
The cars are necessary.
Tell him you can't do it.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I was lucky.
Choose who you want.
I live on Park Street.
Where's the exit?
My favorite color is blue.
Tom's family lives in Boston.
She speaks Russian.
The kids are asleep.
You look disappointed.
Tom works for Mary's father.
You're much faster than me.
Why don't you go play with her?
Is it blue?
Tell me that's not true.
He left without saying anything.
I advised you not to buy this house.
Tom's popular.
That's very expensive.
He was disappointed.
The dog's white.
When are you coming?
Mary is my wife.
Looks like someone's calling you.
How many tickets did you get?
I've never been to Paris.
Tom has visited Australia three times.
It'll snow today.

I rarely eat outside.
Kneel down!
Please, hurry up.
You're drunk!
We've seen him.
They have potatoes in France but not in the Netherlands.
What can we do about Tom?
We think it's unfair.
Did you invite them to the party?
You've got to clean up your class.
Why are you laughing?
We have a lot of schools.
Mary's exorcising Tom.
She's not talking; she's screaming!
Are you from Australia?
They won.
What did you eat?

You're smarter than them.
I love what you're doing.
Which football team do you support?
I'm getting up at 6:30.
I like rice.
Tom blew up his wrists.
They ate at the restaurant.
I like that shirt.
Are you ready?
Good evening, what are you doing?
I won't tell anyone you're in Boston.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Anything else?
Tom's cute.
Are you going to Boston next week?
You look happy today.
I want you to stay.
We're gonna bury her.
That's easy to say, hard to do.
She showed me her room.
When will he come?
Australia is a good country.
They'll fix it.
I don't care if you go or not.
It was weird.
No one understands him.
Tom doesn't have much money.
Tom grew up in Boston.
Do you have a red mole?
Everyone knows me.
Mary believes you.
You're bigger than her.
Let me make my position clear.
I never understood that.
She's washing her head.
You're smarter than him.
Time will show.
I'm not gonna be there.
We didn't know who he was.
Is your car black?
I'm sending them a message.
Tom left for Boston.
Tom's not fair.
Tom wrote three letters.
Tom's not your brother.
Where are you guys from?
It's a lot of coffee.
He likes the walk.
The man's young.

Can I have one of these?
Pass me the pepper, please.
Was anybody in the car?
That's my baby.
Nobody moved.
It's not an easy language for the French.
Tom came home tired.
Stop Tom.
They're bigger than her.
Did you hear her speak French?
I read a book last night.
He was accused of nepotism.
Tell us about your trip.
Tom says it's urgent.
Tom had to accept things the way he was.
How old are you?
He likes to read newspapers.
We'll find them.
My father was a Greek.
They were mine.
Are you shy?
You can't kill all of us.
He didn't know what to say.
I wouldn't like to lie to her.
I saw Tom in the library.
Tom's planning on staying in Boston until October.
Let me make my position clear.
Is it important?
I assumed you were Canadians.
You bought a new house.
You've never cared about me.
The thief turned into a cop.
Can I get you out of here?
I thought we could stay here all day.
Tom and Mary seem to be messing around all the time.
Tom gave me $30.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
He knew it from the beginning.
Everything went well.
Emily asked me a question.
Let them come and see me.
You played.
I wonder which route is shorter.
There's a safe in Tom's office.
I want to go with Tom.
Who sent it?
I hope to see you soon.
Carol reads Spanish.
Everyone agreed with his idea.
Come quickly.

He's still here.
Nobody's sitting here.
Where were you last Monday?
He met him three years ago.
Tom translated the document from French to English.
It was empty.
"Thank you." "Please."
I have something to say.
Everyone's waiting for Tom.
Did Tom do that to you?
You need to help your friends.
I won't lie.
Who did you go to the dance with?
You don't make enough contributions.
You're my best friend.
Tom's skills are impressive.
Give me what you got.
Keep talking.
Don't leave me here alone.
Tell them it's important.
You shot them.
I'll pray for Tom.
I'm too big for Mary.
Who discovered the phone?
Forget to turn off the light.
Give me thirty minutes.
They look happy.
They're working hard.
Tell her you can't do it.
You ruined it.
You have a few books.
We're ready to help.
What did your teacher ask you about?
Tom loved Mary very much.
Is it yours?
I'll buy a new one.
Tom's afraid I'll lose.
I'm too tired.
I want to learn guitar.
Do you like your car?
He's elected mayor.
Did you help Tom?
It's my turn now.
She's giving me my life as a witness.
Tom gave me this tie.
I wish I had been born in Canada.
I miss her.
Were you happy?
She's happy.
You're incredibly stupid.
I won't wait for you.
Is Tom sick?
What do you want?
We like the kids.
He was wearing a black hat.
I closed my eyes.
Tell him you don't need her.
I like dancing.
You got the wrong key.
I thought Tom was a Canadian.
They were young.
He died fast.
Are you angry?
What are you doing?
Tom's a mathematician.
Are you Tom's friend?
How did you lose it?
Every year, the world population increases by two percent on average.
Tom was the suspect.
I thought you were Canadian.
I would never think I'd meet you here.
I want you to sing.
Let me go!
Tom killed Mary.
You speak Hebrew?
Who sold his car to Tom?
You're so weird.
Come here right now.
They speak French.
We have to finish it all by Monday morning.
Yeah, sure.
Your husband's cheating.
He's an obedient Tom.
The merchants only look at the profits.
He married him for his money.
Many people in the world like pizza food.
Mary's playing piano.
I don't love Tom.
I have to go to sleep now.
I want to live in Brazil.
Do good to those who hate you.
What exactly are you trying to prove?
Tell her you lied.
English isn't my mother tongue.
Will you give me your number, please?
Leave it there.
He may have his flaws, but I like him.
Don't believe it.
Who's your teacher?
I always listen to music; I can't live without her.
It's gonna be hot today.
Kiss Tom.
Who?
Tom's very quiet.
He made me a cake.
Is your car fast?
I got up from 7:00 this morning.
What the hell did Tom mean by that?
He's a quiet man.
I ran to the bus stop so I wouldn't lose my last car.
Thomas told me Mary was in prison.
I'm fine, thank you for asking!
I saw Tom walk with Mary in the park last Monday.
They've sold the TV.
If you have anything to say, say it.
This house isn't too big.
Tom was busy.
I like to laugh.
I'm rich.
You want to marry me?
I like the music and the English.
He fell asleep at ten yesterday.
You haven't told me who you are yet.
I have as many books as Tom.
I like this song.
You're a patient woman.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Give me another chance.
There's a book bet on the table.
We should choose the right person for each position.
Think first!
Do you trust this man?
Who's gonna count the stars?
This is a game for four players.
Don't come near the dog.
Yeah, I'm coming!
Tom's missing his wife and children.
Where did you go on Sunday that we passed?
Hold both your hands on the wheel.
He made me a cake.
Is Tom lying?
Where was she born?
That's original.
No one ever came to see me in the hospital.
You're not thirty.
Everything was perfect.
It's very fun to hear music.
I think Tom's right.
Life is small, even if the smile lasts only a second.
Now I know the truth.
My mother's here.
Betty's here lately.
Did he accept it?
It seems to me that you don't often help other people.
Wait, I want to tell you something.
Next time I'm in Boston, I'll try to visit you.
I know a lot of pilots.
We were struggling to survive.
We're not afraid.
You want this?
You're not yourself.
It was yours.
The house is too big for us and besides it is very expensive.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Australia is a fantastic country.
They're smiling.
"Did she kiss you?" "Yes." "I knew it!"
I'm on the team.
I have more money than you do.
Tell me about your son.
Still staying on Park Street?
He shut the door.
He's so young.
Tom and Mary are arguing, but they're not legally married.
We went to a nice restaurant.
Tom doesn't hate you.
They trust him.
Are you members of a gym?
Where do you want to go?
There are books here.
I helped my father yesterday.
Idiots!
I just did what Tom asked me to do.
Tom told us not to be afraid.
I need to know French.
Two beers, please.
Tom will survive.
Lori lives in Melbourne.
Lock the door.
That thing moved me.
Let me make my position clearer.

Mary's Tom's girlfriend.
That boy has black hair.
What do you know about Australia?
No one knows how it works.
You look tired.
We were both very hungry.

Get them to stop worrying.
Everyone laughed.

Please cancel my order and return the money.
He's green.

I'll show you.
You're gonna stay here tonight.

I refuse to accept this.
We all know you.
Drink some water.
I like cats in my dog.
Are you alive?
He's a good singer.
Tell him I'm sick.
Tom died in 2013 in Australia.
My love for you is hard to explain.
What's that?
Why did you stop?
Tom saved her from the fire.
Food's good.
I'll go with you.
Save them.
I wanted to tell you the truth.
The streets are covered with snow.
How happy I am today!
I don't see you.
He allowed me to see her daughter.
My house is close to school.
I assumed you were Canadian.
You were busy.
It was easy for me to solve the problem.
I'd like you to stay with me.
Tom was married to Canada.
I'll wait for you here at 2:30.
The rejection hurts.
I hope this continues.
I thought I heard Tom's voice.
What did you say?
Come with me to Boston.
Do you sleep often?
I've been feeling numb with so many people to see me.
I'm doing what I have to do.
Peter loves Jane.
Tom's got his hair black.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
I took it for a joke and I didn't answer.
Tell them I'm ready.
When did you buy it?
Tell them I won't do that.
I'm not a doctor.
When I was sick, Tom came and made dinner for me.
My favorite color is orange.

Is there bread?
Throw him out.

Do you like your new job?
I'm glad to see you again.
How am I gonna find it?
She's the most beautiful woman.
A week ago, I had an export of teeth.
You can take a cab.
I rarely watch a documentary.
Tom told Mary to sit down.
I can read English, but I can't speak English.
I think I know why you're here.

By the voice of the goat.

Do you like driving fast cars?
Take my coat.
Don't look down on this rock.
When did you finish?
Kids like to drink fruit juice.
You'll learn to speak Portuguese!

What time is it in London now?
What else did you tell him?
Don't you just shut the door?

Tell them I'm not here.
Tom's gonna change.
What are they gonna do?

You're a liar.
You look pale.
You shot her.
We know you're in pain.

It was expected.
This polythronous one is restless.
Tell them you don't need him.
He likes the paper game.
The power must help the weak.
I need a computer.
Tom seems tired.
Tell him I won't do that.

Call me at night.
Would you like meat or fish?

Tom ignored Mary.
When did you buy him?
Get him out of here.
We want to create the smallest possible rebellion.
We were born the same day.
You're invincible.
She promised me she'd come.
That wasn't necessary.
If you can read this, then you can speak a language.
Everyone agrees.
I survived.
Tell her to come here.
I've always dreamed of going to Australia.
You can wait here.
I laughed so much.
When I took her to high school, she was close to 30.

Come quickly!
I've never been to Paris.
He's got a prisoner.
You're perfect.
Where's the money?

We don't work for Tom.
Please, teach me French.
My dog is smaller than yours.
I'm paying Tom a lot of credit.
Do you feel tired?
Do you like the red wine?
Who were they talking about?
Tom's not a Canadian.
Don't call me Tom.
I'm trying to learn English.

I want the job done fast.
I wanted to tell you the truth.
Can I borrow your ears?
Where did you find the keys?
I can read to the Spanish without any difficulty.
Your kids will be safe with Tom.

Good luck pushing him.
Why are you smiling?

That's unfair.
I speak French.
Can I borrow your ears?
I don't remember his little name.
We'll meet at the theater.
You think this is a game?
I haven't seen a heterophile in a week.
The man visits Moscow.
Tom said he was going to Boston in October.
Tom didn't want to go out without his hat and his hands.
When did you get married?
Are you drunk?
You're an attractive woman.
Tom's freaking out.
They don't have what we want.
You're so beautiful.
The simplicity is nice.
The horse's not white.
Tom's got a lot of imagination.
Don't give it to him!
I'm sure someone loves you.
He sells vegetables.
I like singing.
Tom's playing with his cat.
Play.
I know you.
My father is tall.
Where are you going?
They both want the same thing.
I'll be back in Australia in two days.

Can you come and work for us?
I like this room.
Are you better now?
I'm not kidding.
Are you really Canadian?
Tell her you lied.
We're learning Chinese.
He's younger than me.

Tom walked.
Where do you work?
Nice suit.
Please come before 2:30.
I'm a man.
You didn't help me.
Someone needs to talk to Tom.
His real name is Tom.
We can't change history, but we can learn from it.
He's not married.
Your English is perfect.
Tom's got money.
Shit!
It's not raining.
Tell them you're not ready.
What are you going to order in the restaurant?
Let's wait for Tom.
This hat is too small for you.
This horse is white.
I'm an anaerobic.
I slept all day.
What city do you live in?
Didn't you read the story?
It weighs over 80 pounds.
My parents are in Australia.
My brother's guitar is new.
They'll fix him.
Where are you going?
You should remember all those dates.
Did you invite him to the party?
You're unbelievable.
Save Tom.
He shares a room with his brother.
Aren't you happy?
He was alone.
Tell them I'm innocent.
I've seen this photograph before.
She didn't let me read the letter.

Stop right now.
We are facing a difficult situation.
We grew up together.
Where were you in 2003?
They listened.
The property is a robbery.

Can I talk to the doctor?
When I was sick, Tom passed by and cooked dinner for me.
I love her and she loves me.
Were you happy?
Our teacher is an idiot.
Thomas is fishing.
Meat, please.
I was asked to resign from the company.
