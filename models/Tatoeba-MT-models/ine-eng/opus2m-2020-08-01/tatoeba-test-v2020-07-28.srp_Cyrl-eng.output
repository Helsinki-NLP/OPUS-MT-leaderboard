In this phase of world history, there is no such thing as an independent press in America. You know that and I know it. There is no one among you who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he wrote it, he would know in advance that it would never appear in the press. I got my regular pay to keep my honest opinion out of the news I'm working for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any one of you would be so crazy to write what he honestly thinks would be out on the street, looking for some other job.

What is this?
Turn around.
Just close your eyes.
Mary lost her key.
Just take it easy!
I hate you from the bottom of my soul.
Tell him.
Do you want to learn something?
We'll have to walk now.
Pizza and Mr. Kasha were walking in the woods.
Anyway, you're wrong.
The redheads are driving me crazy!
A man has many desires that he does not even want to realize, and it would be wrong to assume otherwise. He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such a desire is also the desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, man would become completely sick of endless life, and he would want death.
