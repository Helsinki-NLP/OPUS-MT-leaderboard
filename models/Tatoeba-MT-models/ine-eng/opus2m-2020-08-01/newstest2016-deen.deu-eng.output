Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and the destabilising measures in the Middle East.
But it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-State solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticises the ongoing settlement of Israel and advocates Netanyahu's lack of will in the peace process.
The Iranian nuclear programme's deal with Obama has further aggravated the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, which was partly regarded as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not in agreement with Obama, who had refused a meeting with reference to his current election in Israel.
In an emergency, a professor said to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency, Professor Shannon Lamb told me with a somewhat circling voice from the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was criticized on a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted to make it go away, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school site where he reportedly shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made the hanging emergency ever after.
By the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life when the police threw him away.
One day after the shooting at the University, the students and teachers were forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities were still trying to get a picture of what Lamb was motivated to do.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal precedent.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people", with which he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, comprising 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for permission for health reasons and said he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion, which had worked so hard for the lamb, would not guarantee him an automatic way to a job as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, the police found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still on the way.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said she thought he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He promoted teaching in the spring.
One of the longtime friends of Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met with friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to play the guitar for a few years.
He was the woman's fever at the time.
All the girls melt there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no warrant from a bride.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the Backstein House, which was bordering a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Princess, Shawn O'Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but friends had remained and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer annual market three years ago.
Later they played some gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a lighted bar near Gautier, said that he had seen Lamb and Princess Night on the night of September 5th for the last time, after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmonica game before a handsome audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and making fun of each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On Tuesday evening at Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including teachers, employees, students and members of the community, attended a Christmas celebration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Mahnwache, while the "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The course will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say Lamb made the call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency called Prentisss was named his wife, but there is no indication that the two had ever been married.
Toys R Us plans to set less working forces for Christmastime
Toys R Us says that there won't be so many Christmas employees as last year, but the toy and baby product dealer says he will give the employees and seasonal workers he is currently employed to work more hours.
The company said it plans to set up 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country. In the holiday season 2014, 45,000 workers were employed.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start with application talks and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are even months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to set up timers to provide stores with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it will be quite clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a leading documentary film "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it makes me feel like I'm a simulated gang and an arm's length away from being with the princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with Director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had a premiere 30 years ago.
"It's real to me," Spielberg said, "unquestionably the biggest time travel film ever turned."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected movies in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's reinforced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the almost five years lasting conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and poverty for millions of people.
The UN Chief again calls on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to join and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - at the end of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the crackdowns in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional authorities "make this situation unresolved."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had demonstrated when reaching a nuclear deal with Iran in the face of the crisis in Syria.
8 Surveyes that show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have made him a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks for surveys below, it has not (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump to lead in the two-digit area, and some begin to wonder seriously what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course it is too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time Rick Perrys led the rising Herman Cain, from which no one won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have fought in a general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's sustainability and start letting their dollars flow to crush him.
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are held in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of the Republicans had a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said that they would be either "be thrilled" or "satisfied" if Trump would be nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "damaged" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "inspired" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one in things?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "damaged" if Jeb Bush, the favourite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and policing statements, 52 percent of the Irish voters who tend to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure applies in the first country of choice of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander, says Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his duty effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they set up their teaching hats, Republican voters keep Trump real.
If they are asked who wins the first GOP nomination, they say after a survey of CNN/ORC last week four out of ten that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change from the time they put their money on Jeb Bush four out of ten at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters in the past did not have the clearest crystal ball.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% of the final candidates in the middle of Romney.
Yet it turns out that a variety of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the split field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey of the Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump generated the majority support.
He has 13 points in front of Carly Fiorina, 14 points in front of Marco Rubio, 15 points in front of Walker, 19 points in front of Jeb Bush and finally in front of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would take over the company with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald-Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new survey of CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that just over half of the voters who support the Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change the opinion.
46% said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the time of the other externals, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violent" in his election two months ago, immigration was a turning point and a fishing point in the public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump will be removed from the Republican Party by Hispano Americans and damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration remains in the ramp light, Donald Trump will appear to do.
The frustration over the government climbs to new peaks.
In the meantime, Donald Trump and Ben Carson are about half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their foreign status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three of four Iowa Republicans were frustrated over the Republicans at the Congress, with 54% "unsatisfying" and 21% "helloly angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residents of Germany
Here in Hobookenweg is the most expensive accommodation - with a view over the North Sea.
In the street a square meter of a riding roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt the offer of objects is naturally limited," says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows which special positions cost a square metre most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square metre for a student offer in Munich are not really small.
Unlike Germany's Top Wohnorten, however, one of the prizes is like Peanuts.
The real estate provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residences - with square meters prices in swiveling heights.
There are once again tens of thousands of euros zero - per square meter, well marked.
But good, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is not at the top of this.
Champions League: Bayern Dream Start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double Torschutz in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller opened the way for the FC Bayern to earn 3:0 at the Olympics Piraeus - then he died.
A sovereign performance of the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have protected the FC Bayern in the Hexenquessel of Piraeus a dream start in the "Mission Mailland".
The team of Coach Pep Guardiola won her performance at the Champions League at the Greek Olympics in a warm atmosphere thanks to Müller's Double Pack (52/90.+2) and Götzes Hitr (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start success in the series will be the first step towards finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardianola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
Müller received good help from Ollympiakos-Torwart Roberto at his 28th meeting at the Champions League for the Bavarian Leadership, who passed a shot thought to be the flagship of the world champion.
"We will not underestimate them," said Captain Philipp Lahm before the game at Karaisakis Stadium in front of 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea without glancing.
Piraeus had won his last six home games in the royal class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atletique Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011 Borussia Dortmund also stopped here (1:3).
But the Bavarians, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageous, but often toiled in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were launched too often by the left-wing movement of Douglas Costa, which rarely went through against the former Braunsweiger Omar Elabdellauui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flange from the right half-field into the top left toreck.
In the 67th minute the world champion gave up the possible 2:0.
The best times in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when the Olympic stormer Ideye Brown hit Poland's headball from the line (26.).
Then, by direct decrease, Torwart Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians used to play dominant games, Piraeus was able to put needles.
On Torhüter Manuel Neuer, however, there was trust.
For example, when he shot an ideae over the latte (56.).
In front of a new one, Guardiola had a four-story chain with David Alabama in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which did it well.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the frame, first sat outside.
The WM light only gave green light after the final training, sports chief Matthias Summer said at "Sky": "Whoever wants to do something else out of it is already evil."
In the first exchange, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beat Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by elfmeter, Muller put another one in it.
Before the game it came to Krawalen at the stadium.
After a smaller group of supposed Bayern fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and went ahead with strikes against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was transported injured from the stadium.
Anyone who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Whoever smokes does not only damage the lung, but also the teeth - this puts a Potsdamer long-term study close by.
The good news: if you don't, the risk will fall quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DifE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.5- to 3.6-fold.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammations of the teeth, the DifE emphasises.
For these parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent dental inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear how much smoking also increases the risk to careers.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time, researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years until the danger fell again on the level of non-smokers, first author Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University of Birmingham.
You have to convince people to be non-smokers, scholar Heiner Boeing of the DifE explained: "Smoking shortens the time of life."
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and also leads to good dental health after our findings.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by dental insomnia, the DifE reported.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study undermines the findings.
Archaeologists hit Cologne Rhinefer on the remains of late antiques
Archaeological finds have been made on the right Rhinefer in Cologne.
Close to the building site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum have dug out skeletons and remains of historic buildings, said museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction works at the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called ground paintings.
In all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always added as a trade fair for archaeological ground mining.
In the third construction section of the Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists were now found.
It has already been known from text documents that in place in the 4th century there was a fortress and in the 8th century a church, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which was probably part of the church.
Young woman from freight train
After a young woman at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern has been injured, the federal police are asking the people for help.
On early Wednesday morning at 1.40 p.m., the woman from the railway station building crossed the track at the end of the train station and was recorded by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, she has suffered severe injuries, according to the Federal Police.
She was medically treated on site and was taken to a hospital by rescue forces.
On the basis of the nightly cross-section of the young woman, there are no findings from the investigating officers.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Inquiries include residents or passengers from Linderner Railway, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiferther Straße (L364).
Information on the cause of the accident can be given under the clock on a set and free hotline of the Federal Police by telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
To address the dispute over the proposed transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
Therefore, the contested private settlement institutions for disputes between groups and states are to be resolved by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds to much more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that the citizens trust," said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström in his presentation.
Sweden proposes to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade negotiations with the United States.
The German government announced support.
TTIP will create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU and the US to choose jointly independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come from the EU, the USA and from third countries.
For the first time there is also a second instance.
It would allow it to raise objections against judgments.
So far, the parties to proceedings agreed on a case of arbitration, there was no possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion last month, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it intends to apply its own information to an International Investment Court.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be clarified.
The main reason for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP is that the investor-State divorce proceedings (ISDS) required by large groups are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel litigation, by which companies are liable to contest the taxpayers' claims, to repeal national laws or to implement a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact referred to the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.
In particular, it was criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated Free Trade Agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Secretary of State Matthias Machnig (SPD) referred to the plans as major progress.
The Commission takes into account the key points of the reform that Federal Minister Sigmar Gabriel has drawn up with other EU trade ministers in spring.
The old system of private arbitration is from the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European BusinessEurope Association warned to limit the possibilities of complaint to the economy through too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, Wednesday remained unclear.
The negotiations have been in progress since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
The original framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year.
This appointment is no longer considered to be a permanent one.
Delicate People of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a Flipchart, on which the fearsome folk singer recorded the picturesque state of Michigan with a fillet pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost captured by Stevens' speech.
He tells on the basis of various places that he always registers on the map, about which he reports his minutious and carefully arranged songs.
Where they were created and what it looks like in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative errorer.
With the release of 2003 and the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs that are harmoniously close to the American people of the late 1960s, but at any time can be very opulent.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" would be the first part of a series to be considered: each of the 50 U.S. states should be affected as a result.
However, in 2004 and near Rhineland, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and is breaking certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens will be here.
Live enough guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician who lives in New York will return to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invitations You To: Come on Feel The Illinoisise") in 2005, a well-known masterpiece will appear.
Overcoming ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album ascends to the American Billboard Charts and is not missing in any year's best list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then serves on "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic spare parts.
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and halls.
Alongside the smaller clubs, the stage shows will be presented here as a colourful spectacle of neon star bands and large fluorescent stage coco.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens is part of a five-headed band through Germany.
In the dark held Hamburger More!
He presents mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although there are now almost 2000 guests who are banned in their chairs, Stevens, who have become very mature, returns to intimacy and to the people.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you can hear: The lecture is "upulent" and this allows you to remove the "tablets basically".
Only one addition thanks to Stevens is modest, acoustically playing a few older songs and finally denying himself under thousands of applause.
Jeremy Corby's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr. Corby's debut is expected at the Prime Minister's session with excitement
The new Labour President, Jeremy Corbyn, is due to perform his debut at the Prime Minister's session and first meet with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will be raised to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, which will probably test his performance by the media and the Labour Members from nearby.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corby's leadership, as it will be held after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Chairman to hold a commemoration of the battle of Britain in silence on Tuesday during the national anthem singing, criticises a number of Tory MPs, and focuses on several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corby's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A speaker by Mr. Corbyn said he would have "stand in respect of the silence" and recognized the "Heldendom of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle around England".
But a member of Mr. Corby's Shadow Cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Nights Program that he had told the Labour Chairman to sing the national anthem "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Corby's top team, and they rely on differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.
The BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stumbled" within Labour, according to Mr. Corby's comments on the position of the European Union and the restriction on profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is being modified to remove the whole idea of a total restriction.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, shadow and pension ministers, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour President, David Cameron, since he is the Head of Tory, facing the Dispatch Box in Parliament in the last decade.
The Labour President, who has promised another policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's hour is too confrontational, and that he will be left out of both "fighting skills" and the fight against counterfeiting and has instead taken steps to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow minister of the economy, would represent him if he did not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on his way abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take up the word, and that he had addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the sub-house, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to get away from politics in the style of a Kasperle theatre, which is often associated with the Prime Minister's question hour. But a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the hour of question with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer in the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the basement and his position under his colleagues in Parliament, although critics have argued that they have become a cartoonist and need far-reaching reforms.
'Shoots in Joburg': homeless young people trained to photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a bustling place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn the livelihood.
"I what shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a useful studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos from their surroundings and gain a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

Fund increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound went up jumpy according to data showing an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and July, the result without any bonus in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% over the same period of previous years.
This percentage has been the fastest and fastest estimates since 2009 over the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound increased by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and was raised to 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index was increased by 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20% after the acquisition of the rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont 0.9% higher.
Richemont's latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - re-registered growth.
Glencore's shares increased by 5% after the mining company said that it had taken $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had put his assessment for the company rating on sale.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a preliminary tax profit of 46.6 million for the six-year period.
The chief of JD Sports says that higher wages are at risk of expansion.
JD Sports Manager Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs of its company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber-Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lapish 21-year-old, a hanger with super-stained hair.
The type with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros hard.
Even more.
Currently Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is going through.
Like Victoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard of the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Square.
The Bieber-Build: Here you live her idol, whose poster hangs up in Stettin, since Monday night.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs just as much on the day as her mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If not at all.
She says, "In fact, my Victoria had to sit in the tenth grade in high school."
"I will fill her with a dream."
Guilty?
Who's kidding?
The fans don't.
Not even Bieber himself.
He's got it anyway.
For advertising in the Superbowl's advertising break, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pixel firm splintered many, many dollars on a beer account.
And for every doll that looks like it and goes over the Laden table, Bieber also cancels.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you stand on the window.
More than 100 million people are supposed to have spent that way.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others point out that Bieber was finally in the United States and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" in place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album will follow in November, the many zeros are not interested for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida plaque brings Lebanese on potatoes
Potatoes or doughers?
It is both - and it is in the potato den, developed by the former Imbis possessed Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the phrase "Cartoffel instead of Doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a stick.
The idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the label "Cartoffels instead of Doner", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, in his shop, a grill is turned around with meat and potatoes.
"That's multiculture for the stomach," Alhay says.
The idea has now been introduced by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
It has recently been protected as a pattern of use, according to the Authority.
So how much meat and how much potatoes the drink contains, Alhay does not want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of peoples is also good for its customers.
Metcash launches soil resistance campaign to combat Aldi-Effect
Metcash is trying to protect IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a soil sustainability campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the face of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing for the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brand through mainstream marketing and social media marketing, as well as events such as Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as icemaker Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and shipowners who sell certified tickets to faithful customers for the South Australian Football.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler performs his annual investor strategy day.
It is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA charging businesses and generate higher profit margins than Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will be removed about five percent of the food market in these two countries 12 months after opening its first market and will remove all existing actors, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million of revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will achieve a sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in terms of amounts on a high fixed cost basis at Metcash could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and taxes, Mr. Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the eastern states, mainly Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's turnover in the food and food business is 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglas, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the board of Metcash contacted Mr Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has decreased from 18 percent since 2010 to 14 percent, and revenues from Metcash's food and food trade, which has provided around 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction at the same time pressure on turnover and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million in order to compare selling prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and to provide a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash's chief businessman, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and charging sanitation programs will be added to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgyz and, according to the president of the Australian tennis club, Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism of his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is always referred to as "Special Ks", is driven by the announced clash of Kyrgyz with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters in the ramp light.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon afterwards Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the judge, with Harrison shouting: "Wawrinka would have had to beat Kyrgyz, and I should have beat the child."
While he was last seen defeating a tennis player after a battle defeated a potential U.S. open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis of Healy was constantly defended.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup semi-final against the UK.
"One thing about which I am quite proud is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi was a little involved in the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a battle when he lost a battle in the US Open, but he is not the first player to break a battle from frost with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he is trained hard, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be assessed according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgyz into account in the important decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term solid component to the team."
"First we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick has managed to get up very quickly, which people like Feder and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the disaster light in which he can only think about it I think is appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and began to row off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, and all those who tried to get illegally into the country were determined to stop the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a non-Serb country responded with excitement.
The people who fled for violence spent an unknown time on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and lay there.
But frustrations grew.
When a police screamer swam over them, the migrants "Opens the border!" and screamed insults against the Hungarian emergency police.
Some show back from protest food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "inadmissible", that migrants from Hungary would be returned, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a side effect.
Talks must be held with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border could not agree on a common immigration policy one day after the 28-nation bloc in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in Italy and Greece, and they expressed their hope that - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would finally be reached that the EU countries would accommodate another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not focus its hopes on a swift action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency situation in two southern regions, which took place on Tuesday, gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szyjjarto said, however, that his country is also planning the construction of a Stacheldrachtsaun along its border to Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisons were used in the race to create the Stacheldhart-Zaun between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major gateway for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the point of entry into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13 feet) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher penalties for convicted human traffickers.
"Because of the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
We say very clearly: Illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree with the use of the military, which is expected next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Country Security Adviser for Orban, said that the authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others were already deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the zoo, they are now in police custody, and they are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in charge of quickly repairing the fence.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia, after a train wagon with a rod to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a number of people to enter.
About 20 came in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked Serbia and Hungary's main motorway connection and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead before Bernie Sanders in national survey
Former US Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to take a two-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins against her on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47% of the democratic voters in the elections (58% before), while Sanders is in second place, with 27% (up 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced his candidacy for the presidency, receives 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections.
More than five months before the elections start, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more persistent in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS-News survey, Clinton has lost some of the demographic groups, while Sanders has gained some gains.
Clinton has a great lead in women and men with disabilities, but these advances have decreased.
Their support for men is significantly reduced, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton's advantage in democratic voters under 50 has been accelerated, and she and Sanders are now at the same height.
However, Clinton still has a great lead in the older voters.
Last month Clinton was in front of Sanders with two-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the country-wide elections say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because they are the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Maybe it's not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly impressed by her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say this about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with problems and selectivity is also cited.
As the Vice-President throws a potential for the presidency into the Waagshale, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not.
When democratic voters of the elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, prayer is at the top.
Clinton's followers say more than half that Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's preference for Sanders is increased, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this number has dropped by 78 percent last month.
Beden is a second in this measurement at a distance, but the percentage that sees him as the "selectivest" has increased.
However, when it comes to the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters call questions about the selectivity.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these electors of the elections.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features of their party's election.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership.
Biden cuts off the three candidates best for honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not believe him.
Democratic voters of the elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked as a foreign minister during the term of office, most democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions as a whole.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on their general views of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsened.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is regarded by the voters of its party as honest and confidential, this is still a problem for them among all registered voters: only 32 percent view them as honest and confidential, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of the electorate do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the country's voters also view Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good grades in leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush cut off the best in honesty.
A majority of Sanders look more than honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson stands up for a nationwide survey near the back of Donald Trump
Ben Carson is in the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates are currently receiving half of the voter support in the new survey, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers throughout the country. The support is growing by 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is well received in demographic groups and exceeds Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, was defeated by Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who was most deeply affected, with 10 % of the last month's support to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are 6% in the third place.
The error margin for the sample of 376 persons from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was performed in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is increasing in the survey - he is 19% in support of the Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% in support.
The latest survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a look at a carson rising last week, Trump found some side heights for the former neurosurgeons, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Enjoyable bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for those who take a bath to find hot water.
A bath in the North or East Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go to the sea: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and East Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) shares.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east they reach up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic, there are 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees away.
Five members of the brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College-newling
Almost two years after the death of a student during a shaky ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, a murder case is filed against five people.
Members of the New Yorker Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 brutally and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police informed him.
Officials said he was loaded with eyes connected with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a goal through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothing, to google his symptoms, and to contact Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood, to take counsel, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point the members began to hide tools and put the welfare of the brotherhood in principle over that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be reincarnated, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
After an autopsy report, deng was repeatedly added to head, thigh and thigh injuries.
"To many families they were destroyed by the Shikanes of the brotherhood. At least one student has died to the Schikanes since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Dengs family, in a statement.
Brothers and their members must be taken into account, and this is a very important step by the authorities.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third degree charge for the first five members for murder.
Twenty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of shaky attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We want not only to make the parties responsible, but if there is an organization that - officially or informally - has punished this, we will also take them into account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest
There is a rise in interest rates, and the house will get into the fence, interest on loans will rise, and the economy will grow into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it all takes and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the end.
A recession occurred within only 11 months after the first increase in interest and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, although not always, a factor in how the economy and financial systems react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on increasing interest rates when they start, but rather on the time needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end of the day, however, market participants could find that the entire excitement may have been exacerbated by an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "cash money," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still to a low level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend-based view of how some areas of the economy might react:
As the market has seen last month, the advance of interest increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for assets to be denied 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," German bank analysts said in a more recent study on what happens after the Fed's interest increases.
More precisely, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly on the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest, rather flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, head of plant strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Regression is a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote it.
In the present case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly noteworthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an increase in the rate of Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, nominal GDP was only below 4.5 percent at 118 interest rates since 1950.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, only a few expect this to take place and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic culture could be risky and raise the question of whether "this time it is different," the Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants focused all year round on an increase in interest rates of the Fed, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strata and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the future trade represents only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all the increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super-cycle with increasing pressure on GDP and pre-recession heights very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows," the report says.
In contrast, this is a clear slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is far from the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market is expected to increase interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on loans is faster than on shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of loans, the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the lenders fell immediately, the Deutsche Bank said.
The strategies of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer relationship between longer and shorter bonds and a smoothing of the curve.
High-interest loans often bring better results in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher results," said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the view of more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flater, credit tensions have expanded and volatility has increased - all market features when the Fed reinforces its strategy.
In general, companies that deal with most of their business activities in the United States will benefit from increasing interest rates and attracting local products.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off as an increasing dollar makes their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debts.
"The story shows that "quality" shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial increase in interest," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have on average exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their pendant with low quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debts are going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most, Goldman said.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savings could see gains through higher earnings, even if experts are of different opinion how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham says
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the sender for his "dumping"
He argues that he is not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said it wasn't very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something that the private broadcaster does not do.
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public-law radio channel was "insane" and that it was becoming no longer different from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumb" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appear to be only under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director General rejected the proposals and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far from its commercial competitors when it came to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will learn about classical music nowhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to order new works, I also really consider important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that it was more difficult to engage the public than it was in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only element of BBC production, which during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport was under fire to get the commercial rivals on the feet.
The Tory-Adgent Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marked?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "on special BBC routes".
He added that he wished the company to find "a hit from our own home stable" when it next started a series of entertainment.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to pay the fees for other forms of entertainment.
Internet rates rose in August at the slowest and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015 there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the recordings in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using phones for sale
Experts believe that the Black Friday has stopped spending in November
For over a decade the virtual purchase has been booming, and many of the main shopping streets of the United Kingdom have turned into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnant after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the 2000 census with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there is evidence that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, then it has always evolved over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers began to make purchases with their phones.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now this is happening, and we may experience that growth is falling.
The Black-Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the legacy sales.
Experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases before this event, which will take place on the last Friday in November.
Last year the average number of buyers cut down five times around their computer to make their snacks, and some traders' websites collapsed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where the buyers fought for snacks, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that some £5 spending was spent more than £1 online.
In some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now carried out via web-shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the interior cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca during a crane accident - Bin Laden's family is being punished
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first graves in Mecca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partially charges the collapse of the huge Saudi bin-load group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crash
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those killed when a crane broke down on Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Griefs filled, mostly in white, the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al-Moaisem Friedhoff.
The mourners' procession took place at the Holy Place, where only days before a baukran fell through the roof of the mosque and then to the bones.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a penalty on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 better ones who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Great Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already said that the Haddsch will continue to move to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the bin-load group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said that the bin-load group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The English language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's leadership was prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman praised what caused the collapse of the crane, which collapsed in a courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before Haddsch, which later took place this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the Krans and its representatives have not been available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also divided the group because of non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the master family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is involved in larger construction projects.
The dead leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a distraught son who was honored by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the middle of strong winds and rains, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people are staying in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (£ 174,000) be paid to the relatives of the murdered and the same amount was permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britain is increasingly employed by craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind
This leads to the opening of 200 additional Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales outlets across the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britain is lowering its barriers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work at home
If you can walk around with a hammer or a brush to reach the walls, today you seem to belong to a minority.
Because British workers are increasingly employed to carry out domestic jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new manager of Kingfisher, who owns the construction chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer low-price services was now overrun.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix Shops aimed at handicrafts and close 60 sales outlets of B&Q.
Mrs. Laury said she wants to hire more women in B & Q-shops, because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men dominate the employees.
She said it was necessary to put on the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that are taking more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There's still a lot of men working in our branches.
We need to move this more strongly to a balance.
In principle, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five leading companies listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial management.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity here is an important issue.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in half-yearly earnings and sales after the group had shouldered the costs of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, who has Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob for Untrust before the Court
On Wednesday at the Landesgericht Klagenfurt two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vizemeister Aich/Dob have to be responsible for their mistrust and tax evasion.
The defendants didn't know themselves guilty.
One of them was also accused of abuse.
From this proposal he was given legal liberty in May.
The current process has been aborted.
According to Supreme State Attorney Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, the accused had used funds from association accounts for private purposes during the years 2006 to 2011.
It refers to the damage with around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also accused of financial misconduct.
This fact was distinguished by the president of the creative Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It shall be negotiated at a later date.
To the dissident’s dissident claim, the defense was that at no time any asset was created by the association.
The sports officials would have calculated only expenses and the sports club for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money would have been out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings in 2001 (EUR 44,000).
"At that time we stood in front of the situation: Shall we continue to run the club or will we stop?" said one of the accused, in the bread business of the financial office.
With his colleague and co-rapporteur, he then decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We have set aside money, put our life assurances as collateral at the bank," he said at the admission.
If you have agreed with the association, you can freely manage the money, it must not be done.
In addition, in the case of financial success, the payment of the expenses was decided to be repaid by 1991.
Therefore, a portion of the expenditure damages were paid only years later, namely from 2003, when an extra was in the account.
Therefore, even pauschal and non-detail seizures appeared, the former obscura explained the proceedings.
The accounts and savings books managed the two accused together, the second accused said.
Why the payments to the association were not disclosed in detail, the judge asked.
The association did not have an interest in the details of the financial environment; it was important only that the debt was free, as the answer was.
When an official investigation of abuse began in 2011, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
The defendants explained that they had been detained.
This security account was on the name of the second accused and was, according to his statement, unknown to the association.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The questionnaire did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he thought he thought this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The defendant had been informed, the officer justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "damaged recovery".
Why did you want to know about damages?, judge and attorney.
The first accused claimed that he had not agreed to this formulation because the association had never been damaged.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "You're all from the tailor."
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
The official further said that he had never paid a cent, he calculated only kilometer money and diets.
On diets, he took into account the association of 1000 euros per month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide accurate documents for the early years.
These were no longer stored after an operating test in which everything was considered to be correct, they explained.
Kilometers had also referred to the second defendant.
All corrections were made in the bar, and he had to drive from his residence to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main debate will continue on 23 September with the examination of witnesses.
Hewlett Packard manages 30,000 more jobs
In addition to the three-year reduction in staff, the computer crisis will reduce further jobs in the division of the company.
There is no end to the placements at the U.S. computer giant Hewlett Packard (HP).
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the number of 25,000 to 30,000 seats in its corporate party.
As a result, costs of $2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion) were to be saved, the company informed the company on Tuesday.
The move will lead to a special burden of about 2.7 billion dollars, which will come from the fourth quarter.
The construction of 55,000 jobs has not been completed for three years.
HP employed about 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
Subsequently, the Hewlett Packard stock amounted to 2.3 percent.
The Californian Palo Alto group, which is grown up with printers, is currently breaking up: This is how computer and printer business is to be blended into a new society today - separate from the more challenging areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business shares are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A newly disappointing PC kit and a weaker demand from business customers for its services have recently added to Lenovo’s second largest PC manufacturer worldwide.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, the paragraph of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
The sales dropped by 8 percent to nearly $25.4 billion.
Thus the redemptions went back in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job cuts on the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only reacted late to the fact that customers increase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online at the same time.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide a total of 55,000 seats.
Conflicts: Most support the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in Iraq's fights would largely be rejected: 54 percent said, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria finds 61 percent positive.
24% are opposed to the conflict.
A collaboration with the Syrian ruler Baschar al-Assad will deny 51 per cent of the respondents, 20 per cent for this.
29% could not decide.
Car: Second press day on the 66th IAA
By 27 September at the centre of the fair, there are connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Car Exhibition under the motto "Mobility Connects" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA of Saturday.
The eventers from the VDA car association count as two years ago with approximately 900 000 visitors.
Röszke: Violent violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have deployed several hundred targeted refugees at Röszke Tranengas and waterworks at the Serbian border.
Euronews correspondent Daniel Bozsik experienced the violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
After that, a police line had been formed and behind the police were ready for a water pump.
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones, pieces and plastic bottles after the officials.
The officials first introduced uninterrupted pepperspray.
After that, the police used Tränengas.
Many tears have been spread towards the refugees.
That's why the group was dissolved.
The refugees are now waiting for something to come back.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the area.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas scream.
Other refugees sat down together and left under breath.
The Serbian police pressmen also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Notary Bank
The world observes when the U.S. notary bank meets in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest will be raised for the first time for almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists who were questioned by Reuters found that a little more than half the last week of the view that the Fed would do this now thinks that the Fed will continue for a little longer and the interest rates will be maintained at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It is a historic event because it has been here for seven years since the Fed interest was put on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good level of performance, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rusty view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.
Decision to be notified at 2 p.m. on Thursday
Death Protection at the Delta State University
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day later - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying that he was "suffering" at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it uncomfortable," the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called for an emergency number at 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning
and said, "He shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency department staff that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house, but that "no one will disturb", but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his guns.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening as a policeman.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday, there was "no information, no evidence" for a "trieck relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they had been married for about seven years as a "good man".
Both were separated 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and she was "damaged on the ground".
He said Prentiss's daughter was "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knows, which was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, has been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "Don't go to jail".
When policemen picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, ran to the side, walked into the woods, and killed himself with a gun.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in spring 2015, as his life course on the university website indicates.
Stars That Lost Their Happiness Bringers
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor also reportedly had to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of possession of drugs.
I'm sure all this will require his tributary.
Eurowings: Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group building.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization.
150 of the around 1000 executives around the world will cost the company the job.
There are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and is evaluating Eurowings.
The objective of the reorganisation was to contribute around EUR 500 million per year from cost and rescue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
For example, there will be no board for passenger business in Lufthansa in the future.
Eurowings is to be developed as independently as possible.
In the board team for Chief Carsten Spoch, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future.
The re-establishment underlines the importance of Eurowings with which the Group intends to join Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organisation of 120,000 employees was a complex strong company.
The airlines signed under the roof of the Passage Airlines Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the cockpit (VC) pilot association, the negotiations will be resumed on Thursday following the judicially suspended strike.
That's what the union shared.
The topic of the conversation should be the rest arrangements for pilots.
Cockpit wants to come "in a year with a prognosis of record results" to deliverable results as quickly as possible.
The conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
The "Wings" concept is in addition to the pilots' transition.
It is expected that the Lufthansa will set off at Eurowings' Group Billiline in the fight against competitors.
Under the title "Morgenzug in the South", paintings by Leena Krüger can be seen in the artist's house.

Luke Shaw by Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffers from a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left-wing defender to the wine and will be excluded from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The injury was caused by a careless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw was hacked into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 is very hard and then plays fantastically, and then it happens.
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask.
He's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to be getting away with a red card and hanging an elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the judge, didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian judge had hurt himself.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an 11 meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how I am broken, my path to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Referring to this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of the PSV
With the European Championship in France, the British defender has an additional incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad offense."
If a player with this kind of injury leaves the place, they are all very sad about it.
It's never our player's intention to hurt a opponent.
Moreno suffered a bone fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 WM.
"It's very difficult because it wasn't his intention to hurt the enemy, and then if you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction, so it looked as if [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In the conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard this can be.
I feel really bad about it.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a fool's play by Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David knows Cameron The Lorax better?
It's a thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't take long until you know it almost externally.
Maybe you're David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Minister for The Lorax, Dr. Seuss's environmental facilitator, published in 1971, decided.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "rejoicing, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give a picture or message that we've missed so far."
Everything is beautiful and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book, rather than a 2012 film- version content that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a young man named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," you read. A loving interest was Dr. Seuss, whose true name was Theodore Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if it wasn't suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and begins: "In the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a young man named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the book’s actions. Here an unnamed boy hears the local environment by the greedy, fallen trees, shriveling Once-ler in spite of the protests of the so-called Lorax, a horrendous, narrow-minded creature, "who speaks in the name of the trees", is devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read the Lorax 20 times behind a child.
A Downing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text of Cameron's employees was delivered, but did not give any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from the English team, but it is still difficult
To hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the frame chosen by England for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an outside match.
Alastair Cooks is probably less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Batting show, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars of 2012, only a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as spin-bowler and Adel Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related message: Adam Lyth leaves the England test frame and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to release Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me to analyze as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no questions at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, there - and I said this before - players are their own best voters.
Long ago, you would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control over his own fate.
If he's hoping to find out more runs for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The English coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not do so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how long a test drummer gets to put his signs is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and outside.
The only suggestion that can be raised was that England first employed Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a hit man I highly appreciate.
He is an X-factor cricket player, what we saw early in Yorkshire this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge square, which hit us very much.
He must have at least the same chances as those before him, but this of course depends on the team composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting moeen beat next to Cook, which would bring an extra spin-bowler and get four quicks, came up, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a hit man can't hit there, and this left hand has already shown that he's a hell of a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the frame as a back-up spinner, and in my limited relationship with him, he has really impressed me as a young man.
People may be looking at his statistics - on average 31 with the drummer and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are no large numbers of backup spinners who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for young people.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some smart additions to the train staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, which will bring a lot of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use to the setup.
I have always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or coach, and as Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind, even if the news conforms to the previous sentence.
Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used by the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia, and I don't have a problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team organizers do not determine the timetable.
And you have to think that how players depend on their jobs depends on the results.
Such decisions are not made by light hearts.
The Brexit warehouse (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could be won if the economy operates in a fleet until 2017
David Cameron's unresolved renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is going to get deeper into trouble every day, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is going to break up because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat's friend recently said that some Member States are as deep austerity in various crises as the EU is now, and not always due to its own guilt, an agenda created by the United Kingdom itself with fragmented consents and disruptive treaty changes that they do not want to mostly.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if they were in danger of social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK looking outside the EU tent - "Let's not just with France," says Berlin - and let's see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
The German prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it has happened in the overcrowded long-term listeners such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Coal (16).
France's François Hollande is looking at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a blasphemous force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will stretch out a leg to help the self-britches whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's withdrawal from the UK - something they do not want because most similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, perhaps some of these ministers are planning even deliberately non-helpful remarks, all in the SNP style, while the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process is suspected by my friend.
"The renegotiation was a plea" and "United Kingdom has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how stolen the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics are the Oligarchy of the press barone, as they were not in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro opportunist, who made himself a "EU-Grad-Banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-frightened, phone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo-non-residents who own most of our great newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similar about her, but found that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you'd better distribute bananas to get him off, instead of going to his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum because Blair had laid down the principle of the unadopted EU Constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never gave him that, either.
But the nice Jeremy Corby, who gave me a friendly clip on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he didn't need any more time to waste on me - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnocks Boykott Murdoch's strategy of the 1980s, a mistake then and today.
It can take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corby's official position on Europe is - I express it in a friendly way - in development.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue coloring trend and the wild fields of Tory's Small Englishism may say yes.
It is what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week when the pathfinder fought in him, not to mention that Corby's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father tried on television to be unfair to his cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to remain "under all circumstances" - Ben's expression - was not what McDonnell said, even what JC told his competitors and deputies after all the reports at her closing meeting on Monday.
Whatever the moving bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the social media mess, a hub of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right for Cameron not to give a free card for Europe that allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for self-evidentness, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins must think so.
But McDonnell and Corby's fundamental multidepartments to EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - are no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its multiplicity to NATO - Tom Watson is convinced by rockfest that JC does not launch a campaign to end - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of home for their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital, - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can all be pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the beginning of Monday what was called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a State-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking were created by a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Basic Report" last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have undermined the reliability of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers wrote in BMJ and asked whether the claims "to build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that the assertion of PHE that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people invited to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to bring their views on the damage of various nicotine-containing products into a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose managers were supposed to have previously received from British American Tobacco Fund (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding that he was supposed to have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of members of the Board are not provided, but several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in the tobacco management of PHE.
The research work of the group "stands markedly", that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria", writes McKee and Capewell.
However, these links or restrictions are not discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes served as a way to smoking for children or non-smokers" were delayed.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded to.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies in his search.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small compared to this, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence bears and what not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die of an illness each year with regard to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year.
Through the clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, former head of Channel 4 says
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows such as Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for placing public-law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in strongly disputed windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried for six years at Channel 4 without success to contact the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are being commissioned or sent, which would also be clearly shown by non-subsidized rivals," Johnson told the Upper House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the radio fee, which I do not consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least place its production on programs that others do not do or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to reach the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program is funded, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, if any, both of their own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, led by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that BBC was responsible for hunting for evaluations "because of the ambitions of the people working there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts give back what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that BBC shows such as EastEnders should be sold.
Johnson said that the rather public-law Niske programmes "should go to BBC4 where you can't measure the audience quite, but they fulfill their tasks, and they can argue when they go on their seeming missions to justify 4 billion £ radio charges, "Now, of course, we have created all these obscurous programs that nobody has seen."
They lay them in a window of time in which no one ever wanted to see them.
Johnson said to the committee about the radio fee: "I ask you to find a rather regressive system in relation to conditions that can get the best value out of this.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value here for 150 pounds per year, but for people who are a lot of money for 150 pounds, ask me if that's right, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission to "information, form and maintain".
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and that it should take an example of public-law television broadcasters in Australia and Canada to change this in "information, understanding and entertaining".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said that BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful will be shown on television and enter with commercial broadcasters alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment they are challenged with sound impulses.
Scientists have raised worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The small nematodes change direction at the moment when they are challenged with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by activating motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Further on this topic: Researchers read and write Hirnativity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process called Sonogenetics, which can be used in ultrasonics to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day's procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that provides an electrical impulse in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fading worms usually do not react to ultrasonic noise, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthen the ultrasonic waves that then enter the worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP-4 channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves affect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, such a Nature Communications report.
To create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of its motor neurons carry TRP-4-ion channels.
When applying ultrasonic signals to the modified creatures, the sound waves will be reinforced by the microbrows and transferred to the worms where they activate the modified motor neurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a ground breaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with light impulses.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some benefits against this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent to the desired place in the brain at an optical fiber, low frequency ultrasonic waves of tissue can pass smoothly and can thus be sent into the brain from above onto the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right in front of your door!
The advertisements shame the British Arms Trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapon watch trade fair video.
Terrible killer drones!
Leg joints that've broken bones!
Smurf!
And electroshock rods that cause painful pain, but do not leave a trace!
The happy voice and the cartoon images make no doubt that this display for the world's largest arms fair is a combat parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the willingness of the British government into the light of disaster, to sharpen weapons of repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible on bus stops and in the subway trains that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive with the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) you read in the fonts of the London Underground and the mark of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tanker.
In September, a swarm of gun dealers will drive with the DLR ... Customers will be asked to help with the stop of the gun fair.
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum for Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-£ package of inbox keys, from which it is claimed that "access to around a third of the bus stop advertising surfaces on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "Vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will be critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists in protest movements and note that they have to move outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another anti-Weapon Trade Placate welcomes the pendler in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed over 100,000 times over 24 hours over Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, who works jointly with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Liver was amazed at the silence that ruled around the advertising for the gun fair - through an empty site of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic firm advertising, but "through the inflaming with bright colors and animation it remains stronger.
"They've done a great job helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not unlawfully dealt with at our door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the gun fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are doing fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US Army about "the AT4CS RS fired by the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped fighting head that delivers outstanding post-effects within the target."
Whatever it does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Housing
Eleven years ago, as a self-remembered 19-year-old, I moved into a student's home, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the excited smiles of those I've been angry with - and the numerous, long-lasting complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance to the student residence is quite nervously enough to be absolutely frightening.
It's tempting to say: tell people where you're coming from, whether or not you've taken a Saturday year, where you're about Corbyn and why you're saying "I honestly don't love or hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just a haha extract, I'm in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It links the conversation and helps you find the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your wippers were on fire and these fire extinguishers were.
Let people go.
The rooms of people often turn into drinks receptions, movie night venues and municipal meeting places, but they are also the places where people are attracted and their underwear are drawn.
To this end: Do not think about starting a relationship with the Union
Introverted people receive severe treatment at the university.
Your room should be a place of refuge, but many student homes form a space-to-space boom culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That could be hell for someone who's trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy I used for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a Komilitone of Society is exhausted - and send him a text instead.
By the way: Do it.
A guy in my student residence had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship closes through bakery.
As you start the union at the top of the back mania, the knock on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brownies, less rare than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have baked you something. So, and now smile, if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade candy is a good way to make friends.
Your fellow citizens feel obliged to stay and may at the end associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you hit.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the clowning of chickens is a theft, but is it also the taking of a drop of milk for your tea?
Check with the dairy owner.
The chances are that they say to serve themselves even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your things, it's angry, and you have my sympathy - but try to behave more balancedly than my companion who added a washing machine to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a noise that keeps people from sleeping or from work.
It's not only about being a decent person, it's about being one of the people who sit in the glasshouse.
A girl on my floor asked her neighbors if it made them something to put Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 p.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before they had their own music spoken, closed their doors and went to their three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse were accidentally taking the same student home?
On the other hand, would it not be deeply painful if you were to hold a roommate for your future spouse, to date them, to separate again and then to see them every day and perhaps to live with them as they bring out all their friends to themselves?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a warm companion is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to convey a little sense to your underbody.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unclosed room, the border between a wolf and a mobbing is finer than it seems.
A good string is funny, but it only takes moments until it gets to the boomerang.
By hiding, give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never spoil someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock her door and place her keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but thank her holdings on the deck no more than twice.
Private homes for refugees, self-employed, low-income
The real estate company Markus Gildner builds in the medieval corner houses for people who do not have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the minor slave."
"I show you how to build cheap and good today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheap living space can be created: he builds series houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be forced into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or tunnels has no sustainability.
Because people stay in a large part here.
In view of the refugee flow, we also need sufficient living space in the next decades.
The solution is a completely banal, three-stop shop.
Currency: A row house needs at least space.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when you put people in blocks.
Each of the six houses that are built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for each four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs.
How high are the costs?
Currency: The price for 160 square meters living area per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
That's obnoxious.
Six months it took the building.
That's appropriate.
Did the construction regulations complicate their plans?
Guildner: I have correctly completed my project.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the place regulation.
Terrible.
It is still signed that in a row house three apartments need at least three seats.
Only in the cities is the place missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their serial home project?
Guiltner: There were some who suggested to me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
That's definitely not true.
But don't you step up the competition for affordable apartments?
Guildner: True, we have had a building in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly afford more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need a living room.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the minor.
I'm showing you how to build cheaply and well today.
That's why it's happening.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, typing "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have crashed after installation because of an error message that indicates that the "software update failed".
To deal with the problem, users are advised to wait until the storm is back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by shrinking the update. It will also be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is up to date or is in the vicinity of a charger so that the battery is loaded.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may switch off in half way and this could lead to a interruption of the update.

Rosberg's only currency: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows about the WM title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton only one change: "Full Attack".
The second WM stressed before the start in the crucial seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose".
53 points separate the Vieweltmeister before the night break in Singapore this Sunday by Title Defender and Twice Champion Hamilton.
Britain has already won seven of the 12 season races and also takes the flutlight Grand Prix in the city as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Brit was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have influence on the great price of Singapore is still unclear.
A thunderstorm has been hanging over the city for days, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club, founded three months ago, "Schachfirde Bad Kissingen", has taken on another member in its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st class and honorary citizens of the cities of Spielkamp and Lübecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation, which was rejected by President Alfred Klein.
It is possible to include chess players who cannot make the Member's contribution.
Youth and talent research should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" will be seen as an expression of its connection to the Kurstadt.
Quarter office looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Altencentrum Antonistift have gathered under the cover of the Social Foundation and opened a new starting point at the Count-Stauffenberg Square.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses.
The Social Foundation takes it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, the Count Stauffenberg Square.
A new neighborhood office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and consultants will immediately receive information about issues such as care insurance or the services of hospitals and care centres.
For years, with our ambulance, we have found that caring relatives are often left alone.
There are endlessly many questions.
"Not often much of the cash benefits are not taken into account, because the complexity of the insurance is not yet understood," explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Civilian Hospital as well as for the ambulance service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new headquarters also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
To this end, the Saludis was taken to the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as storm prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers from the Senior Center and the Health are complemented in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, precautions and reha.
"The Senior Centre for Care and Care", heike Riedel, director of Saludis, wrote.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is seen by both managers especially in the demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure essential in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the dedication celebrations, the neighborhood office also dedicated itself to the age association: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular chat room".
In this way, the Social Foundation has made a great contribution to ensuring that seniors are able to live as independently and well as in their trusted environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 14 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Bamberg's entry against Würzburger Kickers on October 6th
Now it is official: After the Fuchspark Stadium's restoration work had not yet been set against the third-party Würzburg Kickers, the 6th of October was set as a date.
The meeting of the FC Entracht Bamberg at the eighth final of the Bavarian Football Totopokals against the third-party FC Würzburger Kickers was now finally finished.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 7.00 p.m. in Bumberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are happy that we now know when the game is about stage, we now have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the pre-sale of cards now started.
It is special for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because liquid games have a special ride.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Entracht Bamberg entered 2010 by winning the District Lister 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and home against the Regional Lister 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive EUR 5000 and will qualify for the first round of the DFB Association 2016/2017.
Title defender is third-party champion SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna Architect Karl Mang died 92-year-old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died already on 5 September at the age of 92, as reported by the artist house on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as stated in the exhibition.
Born 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture during and after the Second World War at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and institute manager.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the Chamber of Treasures in Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Lobkowitz Palace into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parkpuff: Tim Wiese is throwing money at the police
Ex-Footballer Tim Wiese is bad in Bremen.
At one time footballer was, in the meantime Tim Wiese, ex-nationalist in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to add, according to his own statement, in the last two years.
He didn't intellectually admit it.
Wiese just cut his hair in the Bremer downtown when he saw a parking guard outside exposed a criminal record for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Then he stormed out of the shop, attacked the official and threw the fines before her feet, as the "image" section reported.
At the city of Bremen you confirm the allegations, but it is not yet clear about the consequences of the unusual event.
"The thing is still in the test," it says from the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether or not to show it.

The fertile soil and the rain forest climate of Isla del Rey are best suited for the cultivation of marijuana plants.
For three days, the Panamanian authorities have broken down the 4,500 plants and burned them.
Men cling to 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for an event in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 11:45 p.m., three young men were on their way to Bad Soden in the direction of Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghane, followed his two friends, according to the police, at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the height of the bft tank.
There were also three persons on the site of the tank station.
One of these men now yelled at the young man and hit him with his fist in the face.
The victim suffered a bone fracture and was bleeding out of the nose.
When his two friends gathered up and spoke up to the beatings, he first left his victim.
His friends now brought the injured young man home.
The perpetrator chased the group with a car to their apartment and went through it demonstibly several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the striker and another male.
With the aid of a battalion, the victim's face and jaws were used.
The injured person had to be brought to a hospital for medical purposes.
So far, there is only one vague criminal description.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second striker was about 1.65 meters tall and was clothed with a Jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and notifiers to report under telephone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Praxis Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Goll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Heinfried Kabbert is also a member of the municipality's mayor Bernd Bormann, an economic supporter of Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asenddorf's mayor.
In many places in the country, asendorf has no doctors: there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen goes to rest, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, is still standing next month with half a place on his side.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on October 12, until then he invests 310000 euros in the spaces on St.-Marcellus Street 6.
It was sympathies at the first glance when the rock houses Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Goll, met him years ago, who is currently completing their specialist training in the World Hospital and will also enter the practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laugh.
"When it was so far, I just called her."
The Müller couple felt the idea of doing their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Muller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
As an advantage he also sees himself soon as his own boss.
And that's how you agreed that the Mullers bought the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There is also a double family father named Frank Müller, who attended his medical study in Hannover in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sullingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently an obstetrician in Sulingen, and was appointed as a leading notary in Diepholz County in 2009 and is committed to the DRK readiness of Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
As of September 19, the practice for the new boss is being prepared.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his Gattin Ursel (internisist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The müllers, both internalists, want to go down as home doctors.
"The endoscopy is therefore coming out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Goll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic examinations as well as long-term and load EKGs and need a more talk room.
In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.
A total of EUR 50000 is awarded to the millers under a support programme from the county (EUR 25000) as well as from the municipality (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued," stressed Mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongol, about 2000 patients come to the Galstehausen practice every quarter, in which the North German average practice is about 500.
In Asenddorf there is another household doctor practice.
A positive side effect of the practice acquisition by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen in Asenddorf, the pharmacy remains.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone too.
Anyone who visits Müller's speech class is still looking mainly at familiar faces: he takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rock houses.
With their separation ends an era in Asendorf, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"At first we had only two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen.
A little wetness has already been on her after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and many patients will probably still see," says the internalist.
Her husband laughs: "We have a 6000 square metre base."
"Bysheer, I've always pushed myself before gardening, and now it could be different."
The couple also have two singles and they like to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now the border controls are also high at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The checks at the Hungarian border remain parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also make this "of course".
The supply and security of people is at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "there is a need for clear signals," said the minister.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, nor across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
There is a need for a controlled procedure.
Croatia considers "corridor" Slovenia refuses
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow arriving refugees to continue their journeys towards Austria and Germany and, under circumstances, to establish corridors for the refugees.
However, this was not the case with the Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", rather Slovenia will intensify border monitoring - especially to Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to remove its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his or her obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government reported, the first refugees had already tried to enter the Tovarnik/Sid border in eastern Croatia in the evenings to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to intervene in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly in contact with the Croatian Tovarnik.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
Over the next few days, his country has an estimated 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Moreover, buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media would agree on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade argues that it is it that it is up to people to set up certain routes: "We can, we still want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, in the early morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The settlements had been on the way through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometers away.
"We've heard that Hungary has built up, so the police told us we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could, in fact, result in a slightly further Western route to the former Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonian-Hungary.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong flow of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member has "wide possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Since 2007, Slovenia has been a member of the EU's partners since providing a good witness to the country as regards the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still trapped behind the Hungarian border.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent the last night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to move on to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down in Horgos on Wednesday: he was delaying the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border has been closed.
It would not be very high numbers of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps on which alternative routes are signed by Croatia.
However, the crossing of the border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: there are still unexploited mines in parts of the border area 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mines were sent to the border region.
Stock Exchange Hacker: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranok is supposed to have been a ring of cybercriminals who have been proposed to have been able to have access to unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Market Wire and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information used should have been made available to the financial markets.
In this way, the researchers were estimated at over $100 million in total.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country's borders are finally caught," says the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 other defendants were pending.
Most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted both in the US and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Parade Square is a rich operation.
People perform their concerns, partly quick steps, partly welcoming.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim Car Salon at the Parade Square.
Keep the city track.
Pulsating, pulsating life in the glorious autumn sun and in the middle of four large tables each with the title "Before I want to die"....
The Ecumenical hospice aid was attentive to its 20-year-old existence with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we've gone through action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The Head of the Ecumenical Hospital Assistance is also available to passersby for questions and interviews as well as to the honorary staff.
While a passerby picks up spontaneous calls and the sentence about "feeling my life", "read", "drive with the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "not long suffering", others stay up, read, say sentences like "as far as I am not yet" and then go on.
At the edge, small discussions continue about the action on themselves, about life, dealing with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I make it clear to myself that the end of this world will come to me, I can be responsible," says the director of the Diacon work Mannheim, who is together with the Caritas Association of Ecumenical Hospiz aid.
Therefore, this public action will be good for the 20-year-old.
However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables. Finally, it is a very personal matter.
The topic of death and death is still caught up with Tabus, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people.
An estimate that Angelika shares Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the honorary employees of the first hour.
Because of personal experience faced with the subject, she read a lot of literature and decided to want to engage in the death assistance.
When the Ecumenical Hospiz aid was sought by the honorary officials, it was immediately registered and was at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 honorary officials - 43 women and two men - who are involved and associated in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and in Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They're all trained carefully.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and with the experiences and experiences involved.
"I see life from another waiting, it is precious and value the moment," she says.
The offer of an outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free and free of charge.
The financial support of hospitals and donations from relatives and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of death and mourning mates.
Each two years training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now shown in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There are also other personal wishes listed on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial perspectives decreased for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supplier giant reduced its profit outlook to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company wanted to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 according to a survey of FactSet.
The lower view comes in spite of price increases of an average of 4.9% and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher subsidies for land transport from heavy and large packages to be collected from November.
The company said, however, that it expected that the result against the previous year would increase due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "produces solid results when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than the rival UPS plans to set up 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, such as the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result for each share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which predicted 12 analysts asked by Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts from Zacks expected $1.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has recorded a decline in the international priority shipping, which has led to the staging of sales in its unit Express shipping.
But the tree in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in land transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares decrease by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record stand on 11 June.
At its most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Stratgen spends two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the lead for the first time for almost a decade.
Threatening them at the end of the torn-off, two-shot sitting room, there is a wall image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yelle and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from the Congress: to maximize US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too close to predict them. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start to be relieved of the unprecedented incentive by the short-term interest rate near zero since the end of 2008.
Although most economic data show that they are growing solid, the latest turbulence on global financial markets could make the already prudent Fed representatives anxious to increase this volatility by raising the interest on federal loans - and it is only about a quarter of a percentage.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing in the first place," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Makler company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to increase interest rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which will insure the financial market itself.
About half of the economists who were recently questioned by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest this week.
However, the financial markets expect a wait for the Fed, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market, if the feed increases the rate, unless the strata soften the impact by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, Dow Jones Industrial averaged 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy would maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at that time," he said.
If she does, "she had to go very far in her statement to calm down the financial markets so that they wouldn't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm down the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed to be on good terms to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first step in a slow increase in monetary conditions that would test the strength of rest in the United States.
In the spring and early summer, Yelle had said that despite the complaints of liberals, more economic progress would be necessary to expect an increase in the rate.
Although the creation of jobs slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level seen by the Fed as full employment.
Increases in wages have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets all over the world gathered together last month after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May than investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would threaten global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now being nearly 10% below the May peak.
For the Fed representatives, the market turbulence affects the complex calculation when increasing interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weaknesses of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have pulled the triggers at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US notary bank.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better into the grip.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there are almost no reliable data that describes developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the final effect, the Fed has become the World Monetary Authority.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere mention of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "enlarge" its monetary expansion, triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, representatives of the fed can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision finding is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., observed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that seem to be unrelated to the economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which is responsible for increasing interest, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led to a reduction of 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "in spite of limited recognizable effects on growth in the USA", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives withdrew these cuts.
The Fed should put financial stability aspects only during a severe crisis such as the collapse of the market in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest-fixing committee.
The latest turbulence does not come close to this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest because the markets are shaking," said Posen, President of Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that it should preempt time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market, which is also sold to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/save is a central starting point and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department when you need motor oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes an hour to slide through the corridors.
If the whole shopping is hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garage (good and affordable) in this shop is close to the boxes and has various reception options.
What is it here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are priced and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat dish is extensive, as well as the fish dish - the staff behind the tea will clean and fillify the fish and even if desired for you.
A good part of the load belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you will find frozen Curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and galle, pig's natural intestine, fish balls, regional barley, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and kitchens, including individual families and individuals.
The wide ranges are suitable for shopping carts and forks.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the box.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and the city centre - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small relief for refugees
More and more refugees come to Germany these days.
To offer you a warm welcome, not without the commitment of countless honourable helpers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support useless asylum seekers in the city.
They belong to Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She also enjoys teaching with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum-seeker house on Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from a proper school.
Brazilian Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy quiet
The Brazilian Paediatric Organisation SPRS tries to shock women about how important good nutrition is during rest period. It does this with the presentation of images of babies who suck at breasts that are painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers will be able to increase their daily intake of calories by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results suggest that higher intake of calories is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A current study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that healthy feeding of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the immune system may have a negative impact on the child’s health.
Exceptions for the new Bernrier Sporhall
The municipality of Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million Euro expensive spathall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flater for solar system.
The plans for the long-awaited tournament building at the Bernrieder sports grounds are taking place step by step: in the latest municipal meeting, the project was successfully completed without major discussions.
The Board had previously decided, inter alia, on an application for a "exemption" or "exemption" of the applicable construction plan.
The "exception" was the permit for a special design for roof construction.
Thus, a "satellach with non-mitigated first and roof cover" is to be created.
Based on the planning, the intended use of the roof area for solar systems is: "This brings us together a wonderfully large Southdach," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In the case of the 'freedom', the roof was to be covered for energy reasons - other than the construction plan - below 10 degrees.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "freedom" was therefore required because the construction plan for the roofing does not allow "exemption" - with Bernrieder municipality generally more restrictive in the case of exemption applications.
However, the construction of the tunnel is not a repeat project: "We will not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The tournament building at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and of the SV Bernried.
At the cost of some 2.3 million euros are calculated.
Grants are expected from school and broadband sports.
In the next step, the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will now be submitted to the Land Council for examination.
Pietsenberg Clinic is moving to Schongau
The Pißenberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - that is 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of employees are moving from Pittsenberg to Schongau.
This presents the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county district, confirmed by the Lander Andrea Jochner-White.
However, a decision will be taken by the Supervisory Board, and it will take place on Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in Pitenberg would continue to be employed.
The majority is to move to Schongau with fishermen and the remaining internal station.
The rooms were there.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-White.
The staff were informed of the plans.
The change is triggered by the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been a medical director of Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice closer to the hospital.
According to Jochner-White, the name "Fischer" came into the game, which declared itself ready to take the lead from 1 October to change with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau this means in any case an "upgrade" and an extension of the offer in the field of "Internal Medicine", says Jochner-White.
Fisher is a specialist for heart-step makers and defibrilators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the internal station.
For the next two years, when the Supervisory Board agrees, Fischer will lead both houses, until the next year the former hospital of the Battalion, which still has over 35 beds, will be finally closed in Pittsenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018 when the current repair at Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Lander Jochner-White, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, was told that the house that is in possession of the federal deficit should be used as accommodation for asylum-sweets in the future.
As with the real estate, Jochner-White could not say there are several considerations.
There are currently a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What better thing could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come again," said Fischer about the move of Quasi to the Lech, which was taken "positive and very understanding" by the employees.
A real perspective for the house, where fishermen have been working as a chef for over 30 years, has not existed.
He was asked by his colleagues to take over the position of the Director of Medicine.
The Pißenberg Hospital (formerly 100 beds) has been threatened with closure over the past decades, departments have been closed, such as surgery and birth care.
The handballers of Rhein-Neckar Löwen are required at the Bergis HC tonight (20.15 pm).
However, there is no one to be overcome in Wuppertal, the head of the board of the Bundesliga.
In the last season, the bathers at BHC reported a painful defeat and had some good taste there.
Hunting accident with two injured in Pratau
Two tractors were severely injured during their masonry on Tuesday afternoon by shots.
During the evening on a cornfield near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg) several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a shooting, a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was brought to hospitals.
How exactly could the accident come about was not clear at first.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violence
A suspect has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the interview, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the young and throwing their bodies into a canal in rock houses.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate has been missing since Saturday.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslauter, as state prosecutors and police announced on Wednesday.
As a suspect, a 20-year-old who was arrested on the day of service who was in line with the statement and led the investigator to the body's founding.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had come home on a visit to a autumn party in Rockenhausen.
When searching for the young woman, the investigators first looked for personal objects of the victim.
In the case of questions in the circle of friends and acquaintances of missing persons, a suspicion against the 20-year-olds finally occurred.
The opposite offender then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen where the body was found.
The detainee told the authorities in the police investigation to kill the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the court on Wednesday, the investigators put him to death.
Further investigations should be carried out on the circumstances of the action.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against apartment accidents
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for a affordable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pressing on to a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the latest affordable apartments.
To cover the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units had to be built every year by 2020.
This results in a study commissioned by the Association of Social Housing Buildings.
Compare: This year 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
This means 140,000 apartments are missing.
Refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum-seekers after the first three months of their stay.
Many then fall into the apartment market and enter the long snakes in front of the apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, in the last year less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not limited to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study also poses significant shortcomings in housing policy over the last few years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit, which is growing from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units were missing in the bowling areas, complained Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities forced into WG rooms.
Young adults remained in the apartment market for a long time because of the fluctuations in the hotel Mama.
In the capitals, the number of square meters per head has been reduced for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the Alliance proposes a new start.
In doing so, new incentives should be re-encouraging social housing.
In this way, the basic tax could be waived and the basic tax would be suspended for assisted apartments.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax write-off possibilities are needed.
The support programme for refugee accommodation at the KfW State Bank is already well established in cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, with 184 million euros on Monday, more than half of the EUR 300 million available had already been withdrawn.
Now the project could even be uploaded.
Refugees have free leadership: Croatia and Slovenia set up Corridor
After Hungary, there is virtually no way out, as more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant the crossing over Slovenia to the north without any hurdles.
But the route is dangerous.
Croatia intends to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country yet.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have been displaced to Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television broadcaster RTL.
Hungary had abolished its borders on refugees on the eve of the day.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually redundant.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had attacked Croatia's first refugees at Serbia's border to the EU neighbourhood.
Most of the media reports came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border city Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not fall on border bars.
The border strips pose other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mining rooms are now about to create a safe passage.
After Hungary, there are hardly any more refugees after the border has been closed.
On Tuesday, the police numbered 366 people arrested.
Just before the door was closed on Monday, there were 9380.
The new Hungarian laws include overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offence.
As a result, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern border city of Szeged.
The convicted men threatened prison sentences for up to five years and exile from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the new "transit zones" set up at the border, almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition to Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
In the middle of the morning, 40 more refugees would have stayed there.
However, virtually no one has any more prospects of getting asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The refused asylum-seekers are to be suspended there.
Before the "transitzone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke workers began to clean up.
They collected the garbage that had left tens of thousands of people on the road last week.
Sperrgitters were dismantled and one of the recording sites in the border area was rebuilt.
No one wanted to speak for the purpose of this reconstruction.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the border between Serbia and Hungary has been closed.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants, however, were still in the country, according to government reports.
In Salzburg, some 1,400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train transport from there to Germany was stopped on the morning of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees met regularly.
Mayors drove "Gestrandete" across the border
"We were busy cleaning after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people were standing with travel bags at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the beachmen together with two other helpers and their cars over the border to the nearby Passau.
Previously, we had once tasted the unexpected guests, with juice and drinks.
We just said we'd take them by car to Passau.
"It was of course for us," says Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man did not allow himself to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the firearm.
"We are very pleased," says Stadler.
The beached train passengers were on Sunday in Wels from an ICE in a regional train towards Passau to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail traffic had been stopped to Germany.
However, the regional train was postponed before the border in Wernstein at the Inn.
In Wernstein the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge party connected to the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, days before a two-bridge race sport - organised by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending us another thousand zigzags is a logical result of a seeming policy:
Instead of helping immediately in the Röszke camp with the establishment of structures to ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly put the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dunstkreis of National Socialism.
The leaders of this policy are not only those of Austria who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the "provoked land" which they have invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge in view of the continuing flows of refugees and the approaching winter, to create humane conditions for protection seekers.
And it will be even bigger - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter parties
Konrad has all hands to do with the refugee service.
Christian Konrad is used to saying his word weighs.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to establish quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording centre Traiskirchen has already reached Konrad.
"We no longer have homeless in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Monday was also without any major riots, Konrad said and praised the organizational "mastership".
On the other hand, the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a "critical situation".
Overall, Konrad counts with a need of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 more accommodation will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federation.
If there are more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a face without ground," said Konrad.
He has already conducted talks with the Heads of State.
They would have assured him that they would also create quarters for the upcoming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandater supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, to explain how the Church will help.
Large expectations the Asylum Coordinator also puts in the ORF action "Help as We".
On the platform individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Yesterday, Konrad and Maier criticised the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it may not be possible for quartiers to maintain a certain height of the handle holder or the size of the upper lights.
For a limited period, "notation standards" should apply.
The fact that he was more successful at accommodation than at the Ministry of the Interior is based on his experience.
I am an old lord, who is not told the truth without another face.
Convinced force is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cost the Republic as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
His own search for quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to build a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are obvious problems with approval.
Linz calls for a better division
First, there is no opening of urban spas and other buildings such as Tip Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as it is now possible to stop those who are affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, further locations should be checked for their vulnerability.
Criticism is practiced by the head of the city in the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other areas must also make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Limits are not abolished"
In a longer phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday to follow up on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be abolished.
The further travel of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
Specials with refugees to Germany will not be available before.
However, the applicants would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Pühringer once called for more solidarity in the issue of refugees from the other EU Member States.
The fact that Austria is now also re-introducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" for Pühringer from the German process.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The general renovation of the "New Weft" in the Linzer industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six works of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T is hired, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young innovative companies from the technology area.
"In the IT are the smart heads of our raw material - and we must try to work for us," says S&T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies in the new shop and then also acquiring what.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - some of whom Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Tech Centre, which is one third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal state (FFG).
The building is packed from Linz AG for 60 years to S&T as well as Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni-owner opened second business in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta wanted to lay down a dog.
This project had to be postponed by the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt-Arcade: it has now grown in the form of another business location.
In the Furla shop opposite the business in which they sell bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing of different manufacturers, everything is now about women’s bags of the brand Furla, which are worth 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop has been in operation.
Several weeks ago, it was rebuilt.
"But I've been wondering for a long time whether I should open another shop," says Breit.
The decision was crucial, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags were sold.
"We are the only ones in the Greater Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put in the way by her mother.
I get the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women are late looking at a nice handbag, even the expert cannot answer with the latest certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag of every outfit is worth it.
The Brulljesser from Kalllstadt
The Pälzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called facilitators.
This property is also linked to the billionaire who wants to become President of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he is an enemy of others, he is a rabid journalist, or he reveals a lack of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. President's office strongly advocates the election.
And cut it well.
This is also recorded in the city of Calvary, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is a term in the wine village.
Some in the 1200-inhabitants place are over -zig corners related to him.
His grandfather came from Kalllstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the electoral mode.
The callee Simone Wendel turned a movie about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about their goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find it kind of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their call city, either," says Simone Wendel.
The native cold town has turned a funny documentary film about the place and its famous Sprösslingen, including the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also comes to word in "Kings of Callstadt" (2014), saying that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Callstadt.
He didn't bring it there to the king of hearts.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tends to think that Trump is "a bit of a big mural", says Wendel.
By chance, the name of the peak, the call city in the area, "The Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsch: the facilitator, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the beggars.
The Trump’s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold miners in the United States.
The real estate company's foundation was the first real estate buyers in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return to the home permanently broke into the Bavarian state, to which the Pfalz belonged at the time.
He didn't record Trump because he was missing once without permission, the director of the Institute for Pälse History and Folkskud, Roland Paul, had declared the film to be the beginning.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrator".
This contrasts with the remarkable statements of the offspring.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to scare illegal immigrants.
"It's not as sympathetic as the poltert," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trumps ("The grandmother was a born trumpet, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The waiter sees the American rather distant, "he's always so exciting".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says 72-year-old.
"He's never taken care of CallCity."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions as some call cities that a descendant of the Heinz family spent something for the church organ when visiting, which was generally well achieved.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says 68-year-old.
She found it better if he didn't win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who had the matter at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "if he had never come there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzer daughter Sarah Bühler.
What about as President?
"My President is not," she says.
And: "The grapes will also be ripe without the President Trump."
Wendels Film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, saw 12,000 cinematographers, also in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first mountain village.
From the German Alpenverein Vice President Ludwig Wucherpfengnig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 mountain villages.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A mountain village may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protection zone.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the evaluations, despite Nina's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at today's show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson travel to Canberra to report the loss of the Liberal leadership, but there have been no major shifts in the evaluations for today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull created Tony Abbott's crash.
The rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a weekly series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved an average of 397.000 spectators in the five major cities, compared to 339,000 today.
Today, there was a slight increase in rates for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained after the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August today, on average, 318,000 reached the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is at an average of 349,000 viewers to 314,000 at today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these people in the morning more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the check!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star from Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently divorced father, who decides to go down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show Solo without the raptor Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night responded with a clear "Yes".
The X factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and slightly beat The Block (838.000) and TBL families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results at night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5.30 p.m.) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe scored an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 till 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour 720,000.
Hot-seat average 620,000.
The decline in the quotas for the second evening of The Chase Australia will be likely to agree that the Hot-Sate will finally take place at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that didn't make it to fly the McGuires show.

The last three votes together: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Revealed a secret? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may not be aware of who wins the Bachelor.
The woman who finally landed Sam Wood in The Bachelor was buried in the largest secret.
And not one of the three remaining girls will certainly be awarded if she is the one who has received the last rose.
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons Fellows on the day before being checked out from three, you may have reported who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the end of Thursday
All three women have lyricized themselves about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor, greed, family values and positive attitude as a reason why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If you don't, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers could become the game destroyer, who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons Fellows and Markoski called both fast - except for themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day.
"From the moment I went into the house and (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought it all over the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on earth, it makes so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks that she and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
From her point of view Mackay said that last week the house visit made it clear that Wood could be one.
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was obviously not just a game - I am now completely committed to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood was to choose if she wasn't, she was terrible.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it is an indecision between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne from the bank for the rest of the game when he lost an anchor as it did the Aussie-Rugby-Liga conversion at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula confided in his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point-back and also to the current game after an injury by Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his boots in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49th sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who begged him to forget his captured catch and to take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point that was restored in the first playing area by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the beginning, Hayne and his massive Australian succession for his NFL debut.
Hayne quickly left the field after the fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1, that he could not imagine any worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you only take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his original debut in 2007, when a pass in his own in-Goal area led to a trial for Queensland.
Overall, however, it was a great experience for the 27-year-olds.
Hayne posted for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of women
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian battlefield with armed violence.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company was attacked by Yukos and his democratic efforts were undermined.
The free voters call for the setting up of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high numbers of refugees.
Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW Heritage Club in Großwalstadt against a severe crisis at Bayern's School, if there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing," said Aiwanger.
" Otherwise we'll get promotions in the Bavarian education system."
The Landday fraction of the Free Elections days until Friday in the sub-French municipality.
In fact, quite other main themes were envisaged.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free elections.
"Of course, the topic of asylum is going to overload the clausur," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it did during the Yugoslavian war in the 1990s.
"That's not how it goes, we have to do the causes," said the Free Electoral Chief.
Refusing asylum seekers want to remove free voters as quickly as possible.
This is why Aiwanger also requested more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum lawyers," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticised that several federal countries were not consistent: "We need uniform standards from all over the federal countries."
"Bayarn's pulling away, not others."
"We need to be more effective."
However, the country policy in Großwalstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) launched 47 Gymnasia's pilot "Middle level plus", where an extension of the secondary level is tested from three to four years - in the result it will take nine years to Abitur.
But this isn't going far enough.
"The G9 theme needs to be accelerated," said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all high school students who want to.
Free ride at G9 wherever you want.
Stronger Wall Street helps Dax jump
The German stock market has closed its business with profits after a wide range of unoriented and nervous trades.

Many Borsians expect that the markets will take place on Friday until after the U.S. interest rate has been decided, and that the deadlines will fall to a great extent on Friday.
The discussion on the load from the nuclear power plant has, in the meantime, pushed RWE's shares into a record depth and also left deep traces with Eon.
According to "Spegel", the German energy groups may lack 30 billion euros in reserves.
The federal government denounced the figures in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy groups then recovered something, but eventually lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose at the Dax peak by another 3.22 percent.
According to one dealer, a positive report from the US stockstore "Barron's" came after the weekend.
As a result, investors gave too little attention to the German chipmaker at the moment.
Investments in future Waffer technologies and the focus on the automotive market should be paid.
Car values were asked: Even in the traditional weak summer month of August, more cars were postponed than in the previous year, as the Acea Industry Association announced at the beginning of the International Car Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.

4 people killed after the police shot rubber shots on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets in a number of people who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi District, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they took off rubber boots.
20 Policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber boots used, known to kill, but traditionally used as less lethal alternatives, apparently produced such a high rate of death.
The dispute was the last of the weeks of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi said that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent clashes since 10.
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial topic in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week the legislators voted on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Youth Centre is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters area.
A mix of trade, commerce and housing is planned - concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a large property about 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Youth Centre Alte Post.
The preparations for this are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of trade, trade and housing.
You wait for the corresponding offers, it's called the city.
Any investor who comes infrague, don't be clear yet.
No contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already purchased part of the property located on the Ringstraße / Corner Große street a few months ago and let the buildings on it collapse.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home at the Small Sea at Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Several investors are still concerned - they fear the sale of their holiday home
For months after closed doors were negotiated, groped, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home on the Small Sea are close to Emden on the table.
The interested, the mid-term Ember company "System-Build", presented its plans to the Council for the first time on Monday evening.
This item was originally on the non-public side of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critic and the FDP Group, who challenged the investor and the administration of the secret creamery, Ralph Behrends went from the system-building business management to the offensive: "We still have no answer to all the questions," he told the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to face all the rumors now.
This has been the focus of some ten to twelve million Euros in the discussion for months.
Severe reactions among seamen who had come to the meeting called for the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, maritime bidder and board member in the stakeholder's representation, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant cluster that transcends all other buildings".
He also fears, like some other project critics, that traffic by the intended size of the plant would increase significantly: "There must be all the bus loads to calculate this," says Schulz
However, what is happening exactly on the good one hectare of a large area of the former guesthouse is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First we must have a final concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because of this still lacking, the construction plans are still variable.
Two-year-olds at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is looking forward to growing up with his gorillas.
The 26-year-old Diane brought twins to the world yesterday.
The births of twins are rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and has been in Frankfurt since 1967, it is called the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins has not yet been established, since Mother Diana keeps them close to her body.
At first, the "Image" reported.
NHC predicts a 60-percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde
The US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday a wide depth printing system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verden islands, which has a 60-percent chance to develop into a tropical whirlwind within the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined depth printing system, for example, in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the small Antilles, has also a 60-percent potential to form a tropical vertebral storm in the next two days, added weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have been overcrowded by the European nations, as they flee from war torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager announce, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperate for help.
Donations are made to four non-profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeal will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe has been facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year Syrian civil war, which has driven more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which were devastated by the war.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study.
It is too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote a editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adiposition surgery, using different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit their ability to consume food.
Over the years, adipositas operations to treat type 2 diabetes have proved to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill-fated with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain measure of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered as fat.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital have used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of adipositis surgery - stomach bypass and bowel formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained with those who received non-surgical treatment of diabetes at approximately 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% of patients with diabetes were completely and 28%.
In the medically treated group, diabetes was completely resolved only by one percent and in part by only about two percent.
In addition, the results of blood pressure control, triglyceride and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "in general better in the "surgical" group", the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares average results with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gastro-tomy group (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and listed a complete excess of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more difficult people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, Blackstone says from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study it was possible to die about 29 per cent less in the course of 15 years in the case of fat-resistant people undergoing an adiposition surgery - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any benefit to the survival of the surgical patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for individuals with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, it is really difficult to convert."
Love story plays in the Hunsback
It is a topic that is now more noticeable in Belletristics: A young woman, unloved and invisible at school, meets again after years the horror of her youth, and this one falls in love with her.
So also in the recently appeared novel "In fact we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the novel should be particularly interesting for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author has grown up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to place a literary monument to her home.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddish leader called for the end of violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents under the circumstances.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was surprising, but the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama Germany and Austria praised efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of thousands of refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to consider how the killing in their countries will be reduced.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attack of 11 September and pointed out that the violent reaction of the United States was a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my support in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he resorted to violence, and this has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the intake of hand-infection agents by children in the last 4 years
Drug control centres in the United States report an almost 400-percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow alcoholic hand-to-hand infections, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gailord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the incidence of intakes of hand-infection agents in children under 12 years of age reporting to poison control centres rose from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going to go into emergency," Lopez CNN said.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectants while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of an oral test in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how to drink young disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouth water to obtain a stronger drink.
Young children can be Angelized by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberries, grapes and orange fragrances that are very attractive for children.
Hand-infection agents contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Center for Marriage in the hospital of the University of Kansas, broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't let a blow of whisky around, but people let these hand disinfectants in a range of children, and if children come into it, then it's a quick chance to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaija Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken hand-to-handinfectives from post-earth beer into school, was taken into emergency care.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is legally applicable to an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, a emergency medical doctor who treated her at the Winnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed at her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital on signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through alcohol and had hit her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaija's mother, CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and to store hand disinfectants outside the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after swallowing hand-infection agents that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Employees of health authorities assume that the product contains methanol, a deadly solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as active substance.
In January, three of the fourth-class students in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by publishing antibacterial products around the teaching area," says a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banned them from her room.
The police considered the plan to be "debt" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwänningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old car driver was easily injured in an accident at the crossroads between the Nordring and On Herden.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossroads towards the industrial district and was too late to realize that there were two leading vehicles on the road.
As a result, he pushed his truck into the corner of an Audis and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta.
In the case of the vehicles involved, damage occurred from around EUR 10,000, the police inform.
The 33-year-old audience was no longer ready to drive and had to be dragged off.
Chef: No Disharmonie at Celtic
Griffiths plays the grid of disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, and she says that the Hopes are in a bad place, but that he will turn it around again.
Hearts will fight SFA because of Neilson's accusation and Warburton will be careful when it comes to January's new obligations that could destroy the unit of the camp.
Don't raise the lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half gave Aberdeen a brief victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays Grid over Disharmonie
There are rumors about the disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths. This insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch board leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football long-term Netherlands - de Boer
The former Rangers middle field player and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently a messenger for Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands they don't show the highlights of Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the old firm games, and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, Delilah swears.
RONNY Deala has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian chief has vowed to turn things around.
Following the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen, which now stands at the top of the table with five points of lead.
But Delilah said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way - but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
It's so important to be together now.
Warburton Carefully at January Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he pointed out some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new entrants and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox framework.
Brentford's ex-chief said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal note
Swansea storm Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation, indicated that he could withdraw when his contract expires with the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been struggling with a painful jaw for two years and has not managed to get out of Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA Battle for Neilson Comments Set
The hearts led 2:1, as Fatherson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the Defender was later lifted - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains in what he has said, and continues: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The irreprehensible Hibee was entitled after he joined in singing a song with violent lyrics about Ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The event took place in a roseburn cage in Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the stormer said, adding: "It's safe to say that I'm not going back to Tynacastle if it's not for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has trust in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that the board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but says that the downfall must end in the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll get the boys back to work," said Donnellly.
McInnes was happy to "beautiful to win" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight against Hamilton Accies desperately to see a seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them an advantage of five points in front of Celtic on the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Rowey's Elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything in poker games or leagues that have not won this kind of game."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July at 164,000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose from 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above that of the UK of 5.5 per cent, as shown by the figures of the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, the employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The long-term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Congestion interfered with the process
Since the security staff could not free the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepperspray could the officials take care of the disturbances.
A breath-cool test was performed at a 16-year-old 0.89 promille.
The male adult was taken from his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and remained in custody first.
Why I'll witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a later legal intervention, I'll see how a man gets killed.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear myself.
So why should I?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see facilities in the United States, and since there are often more applications available than places, a macaque lottery is taking place to decide who is selected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will be able to observe it without emotion.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and two and a half hours of visits.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it, and you will get access.
I complained about her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better", but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could get me out of his witness list anytime.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks the public work of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treee would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong likelihood that he's not guilty of the murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his orientation is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man speaks after wet police chase to come from the Canning River
The Canning Valley police officer remained dry when he talked to the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the cool and supple water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried "to persuade him gently to return to the shore."
The Canning Vale police were called to a house-break case in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspects, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Tradel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to wear his uniform, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "a good cop negotiated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Winning football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the trenches to avoid an alcohol check and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired natives to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewarts tried to spy on him and threatens to end the race
Peter Moody claims that Stewarts of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his cities last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewarts and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had carried out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's Late Scratching because of a Sunday treatment, the last straw-cold on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for the race and he had found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt test at Lidaris that he couldn't explain.
He had stayed for 18 months because of the spying proposals and did not want it to "look like too hanging grapes."
"I had to say nothing about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that it all comes out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I'd like to go around the main points raised, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Moody had previously made the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my seats to provide information about what I'm doing within my seats," Moody said on Racing.com.
You obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, surely they should stick to their noses because they have failed to catch me when trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Soundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are.
Should that make me think it's going to be personal?
Did the RVL behave vaguely and perhaps make people outside the trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying is what she's going to think about.
But I have now come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and force them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustrated level of the coach has been built up with the long-standing cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led him to say that he "can throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeatable Master Black Caviar, described the raceday treatment rule as "laughing", after a pack of mud or sound had been placed on the horse legs, which was contrary to the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has wrongly put mud on his leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, whatever it was.
But it was like that on Sunday.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month qualification for the treatment with the package on the Sunday. A study of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after a driver's flight
At the end of the week, the police arrested a man after a collision with a bicycle driver and a later driver in Cobram.
The bike driver was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley motorway.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia of the police arrived in Shepparton.
He is likely to be accused of flight and abandoned assistance and of other traffic offences.
The bike driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital. He is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy fights against rivals due to allegations of ring fights
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has described criticism at the hacking of his players as "Agenda-Setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the judges allowed the storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory at the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a rather unconcerned remark about the storm team after his team won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the tack limb of his team and said that they were only focused on their "contact" when hacking.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers would vote in confidence on his team, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm team.
"This is happening all the time - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talk about ring fights when they beat us at 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed anything to our defensive system or techniques. But in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has brought us the trend.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. So he is probably not used to losing it, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "long-term" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to our Friday night and how exciting her game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticised as a boring team, and Wayne said he'd take care of a piece of shit.
But now he has a team that can play that and we view it as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build more trust because they say these things because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means we're still going to meet them in a phase.
The storm team is free on this weekend, as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday evening at the AAMI Park. The ticket starts from Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 bail after drug charges
A man who may have a life-long sentence threatens to come into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month, after the federal police found 100 kg of drugs on the Yacht Solay, who came from South America over Vanuatu and settled in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed as he met his associates in the yacht port during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life-long penalty for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there is no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that it could have been for no reason.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of flight at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the crime, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a 200,000-dollar bail together as security to achieve its release.
"After reading the essential statements of the two parties, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," Justice Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he gave up his Australian and Serbian passport, reported to the police every day, and held a starting block from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: Driver's house travels apart
A truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening when an accident occurred with three trucks on car 5 at Karlsruhe.
Two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent building towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried unsuccessfully to leave at the last moment, as the police reported.
The driver's house of the accidentmaker is completely intertwined.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Brussels and Karlsruhe North was completely closed for six hours to 2 hours.
There was a damage of EUR 122,000.
Steven Hogg used the phone of girls to lure paedophile to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to demand images of child abuse.
Stefan Hogg took the girl's phone when he was asleep, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a number of inappropriate images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She watched it, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used the terms for looking for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "Pedophile on the Internet" and then he "said to be a policeman to scare them".
Prosecutor Elid Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a search - that he was sick to scare people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out on his computer, but he said it was because he wanted to be a cop to scare Pedophile.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he was sick in his head when he drank, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was at the sitter and at the wine.
She also saw the inappropriate images on the phone and confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and play station used to talk to girls who look much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, accused himself of having taken unfair images of children on 14 June last year, violated the charges on 25 January of this year and did not appear before the court to be heard on 24 March of this year.
Defensive lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sex offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" was found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael moved the sentence until October to obtain background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was kept under investigation due to hearings of other pending cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Switches to small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up at the German-Austrian border beyond the major checkpoints.
Many lockers have allowed fear of detection and arrest to increase people at smaller border crossings
on the Austrian side out, a spokesperson of the Federal Police said.
Along the Inn border, more than 1,000 refugees have been captured in the Passau and Rottal-Inn rural areas since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dust weapons.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded for registration.
At Munich's main railway station, after federal police reports compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday, more refugees met again.
By 8:00 a.m., about 700 people arrived in the capital city, a speaker said in the morning.
After reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday, 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Excursion of "Henry" Tropensturm in the Southwest expected
Meteorologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a deep-sea area across Western Europe, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart is currently operating in hot sea air.
The strong depth was the exit of the "Henry" tower, which was pulled over the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in the past days.
Heavy storms and wetlands are expected in particular in the bath.
According to the DWD, it is still possible to calculate until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Schwebian Alb and on the ground seine with curves from 60 to 90 kilometers.
On Friday, then, the sun can be seen for a longer time.
The mass makes it: Every two years the carmaker on the IAA shows their news.
2015 is mainly to register with the compact cars, which are currently sold especially well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly asked: Around 28.1 percent of the new permits were issued by KBA alone in August on this segment.
This is also reflected in the IAA (Public Day 17-27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept vehicles and new superior class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year in particular.
One of the biggest prizes for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be held in the fall by dealers.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to sell the volume model well, the new Astra should not become much more expensive for it.
Opel represents an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
In addition, the Hesses offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, which are also used for the first time as a drinking cylinder.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, there is the Opel Astra first only as a fifth door.
The second variant will be followed in the spring of the van, which is already visible on the IAA.
And what's going to happen next to the Astra on the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra-competitive Mégane to the race.
At the fair the Mégane is only seen as a fifth door in a conventional and stressed sporty GT version.
He comes to the store at the beginning of next year, then also as a van.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
The Nissan-Ableger wants to find his position with the new model in the strong growing segment.
The compact Infiniti fits fully with its curved lines into the design line of the brand.
The base model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
In the offer there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: The new segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premieres in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1,0-liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum torque is based on manufacturer's instructions at 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The launch of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but around is the compact class model DS 4, which is visible on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble citroën-obligator focused on the front party: Here the cooler grill was redrawed and the modified light bulbs were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was primarily modernised, the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and the first Apples CarPlay integration.
In addition, a series of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A-class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are listed in the IAA compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters Cells are human worthless
The Federal Constitutional Court granted a former prisoner of the Tegel Court of Justice, who had spent months in a cell too small.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation when they are placed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, they can even hope for money if they were confined to the narrow spaces for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This led to the success of a former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was placed at the Berlin-Tegel Justice Centre between June and November 2009 in a single cell with a floor area of about five square metres; the toilet was not separated.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer, was now on his feet again was moved into a larger cell.
His charges against the Land of Berlin were dismissed because of the undeserved conditions of detention.
However, the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Court of Justice and showed the case to be re-examined there.
You see the human dignity of the man injured.
Court of Justice now decides on the amount of compensation
Although for legal reasons of the period in question only a few days were relevant for compensation, there was a claim for compensation.
Otherwise, it would be "a guardian of the protection of personal rights".
The Court of First Instance now has to clarify the amount of the compensation.
In the past, constitutional courts have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
That's what they said in April to a jailer because he was naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple placement of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy.
In addition, Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The defendant then spent more than three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in Karlsruher.
The Berlin Prisons had also come to the battle lines in the last few weeks because of missing staff.
Hence, prisoners are repeatedly detained for 23 hours, increasing aggressiveness, even beatings should have already come due to the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 seats in Tegel are not occupied due to the lack of growth, 19 will be removed in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the Refugee Policy: "We create this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What happens to Germany?
Some 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is even able to accommodate a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we can do it".
What happens to Germany is the following overview.
It is used according to different forecasts between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Tree Ministry) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments annually - and for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built so far (250000 apartments).
The lack of living space is dramatic, but especially in affordable rentals: 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price bond annually, and refugees will also apply for these particularly affordable apartments.
Federal Building Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from now 518 million to a billion euros.
Much too little is this from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social housing had to be created annually and for this purpose the federation had to invest a funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 per cent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them when they enter, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial that they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for the value assessment in the admission society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says Migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Tränhardt, there was a political shift: from the ban on working for refugees to recognition of work.
While previously there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers from up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014 as well as the residence obligation that the asylum seekers are restricted to a place of residence.
In the society, most of the way in which refugees should be given faster access to the labour market has been implemented – also because of the lack of expertise.
A great strain on access to the labour market is lack of German knowledge.
So far, there is not enough supply of general and professional language courses.
In addition, studies show that jobs are most often communicated by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore in the view of Thränhardt der Königsweg for labour integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to Kitas, estimated 10 to 15 percent: "It is only very important for the developed parents to keep the family together once," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
However, in order to convince the family of the benefits of Kita, the administration distributes handsets in different languages.
If the need for educators increased significantly by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialized schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge in welcome classes are prepared to teach.
However, they will not always be taught by full-trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a secondary language.
They don't lack it, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Office estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, there is no ban on the study of a federal country of asylum seekers or patients - the only exception was until Berlin, Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Studyable refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or residence permit no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Application Act when they start a study.
The latter do not, in principle, receive a bribe as they do not fall within the circle of the persons entitled to bribery.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for up to four years in order to be bafég-justified, from 1 January 2016 this spanning will be reduced to 15 months.
However, these funding gaps must also be closed, Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
The students should be immediately informed.
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should successively grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and further develop the existing State-Church law into a new state-religious relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that deals professionally with the new arrivals.
The rights also include obligations.
The representatives of Islam must therefore agree on clear contact points and be prepared to cooperate with the State in many areas and to allow it certain control options.
This includes the willingness to take a stand against religious fundamentalism.
The President of the Central Council of the Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed on Thursday the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to austere such conflicts in Germany, "have their right to live here, in Germany, immediately," he said in the Bavarian radio.
He proposed translating the basic law into Arabic.
Integration will be much more than today as a topic of society as a whole.
In order to change majority society too, the elimination of discrimination and racism will be more pressing.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, been an anti-discrimination centre and a general equality law for a few decades.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and interest groups of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time and what international agreements, such as the German anti-racism convention, will have to become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens will take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany has been able to provide medical care for the refugees expected to be, says Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man-power and capacity are concerned, we will make it," he said to the day-to-day mirror.
However, additional money had to be flown into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asks all customers to hand out health cards at the same time as registration.
The benefits provided could be calculated later with the federal countries.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of services provided by the Asylum Competition Act.
Otherwise, doctors are primarily responsible for creating language barriers.
Even so, as Berlin's health scientist Thea Borde has proved, migrants are less likely to be diagnosed with their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, interpreters should be charged.
Many refugees would also be helped with more general medical procedures in emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it is HIV education.
However, with the partly other disease images, German doctors come out of their training, Montgomery says.
"Parasite seizures or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as far as the medical shortage is concerned, it is possible that the refugees may even be relieved in sight.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, however, they had to prove their qualifications and possibly have to undergo further tests.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to the estimates of the Federal Psychotherapy Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
He is particularly vulnerable to refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recently published study by TU Munich shows that every five Syrian refugee children are traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from a post-traumatic load disorder suffer from, among other things, so-called flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, heartsickness and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disturbances, severe fearfulness and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
Until now, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees are receiving psychotherapy.
Although psychologically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can apply for psychotherapy, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, most professionals or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misappraisals, Munz says.
Many invite to dream
The Circus Probst, with the new staged "Peerdom", draws back to the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to attract each age group into the band of fascinating acrobatics, animal resources and one-time entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites into the mange on the brick what to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chef.
"Peership" - under this motto stands the current man-made scene.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
The gift of inspiration is therefore in the blood of the family.
"It is important to take people out of their daily lives and take them into a completely different world for two hours," stressed the 27-year-old Junior Chief.
"Manegencocktail with World City-Flair", says Director Reinhard Probst his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov clown family attracts the audience with fun and charm in their band.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their work.
With the heroes of the stupid movies, it wants to take the Cuban duo loosely.
Easiness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmon salts, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with fingertips and softness.
Balance with the one-wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
The snakes fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinated with their mobility.
60 Employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," says Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Dissensions in the behaviour of circuses are only too often a topic in various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also says: "If it's not good for our animals, it's not good for us."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are lovingly referred to, will be read as possible from the eyes.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to go into the mange either.
So the highest order: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhangst and a zebra rod, the family Probst is proud.
Both animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not ready for the crew, but it is the unique mask of the Circus Probst.
So there must be something for each visitor.
"One is safe," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are with all our hearts."
The Circus Probst invites every day from September 17th to 20th at 5 p.m.
On Sunday the program begins at 11 and 16 p.m.
Thursday is a family day, prices are reduced for the presentation at 5 p.m.
In addition, the exhibition is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe is holding false speeches in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year from a podium.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case spread rapidly over the social media.
The opening of this House was also shaken by statements by Members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and had been warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's claim with calls.
Last month they had blown him up and interrupted him during his speech to the nation's position in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their phones that they had warned them to disturb Mr. Mugabe's claim.
"The message comes from a number that will not be displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
She warned the Members concerned that immunity in Parliament would end, and as soon as they left Parliament, their parliamentary immunity would no longer be effective.
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "anxious" about the dangers to the politicians.
Hewlett Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will later be divided into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and its service business.
The expected downturn leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP President and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we have a wide and deeper portfolio of business that supports companies in transition to a new business style," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion of annual turnover and "will be focused on providing unrivalled, integrated technology solutions for companies so far", says a statement by the company.
It splits a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment and its Palo Alto Garage was named "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone massive restructuring in order to control the diversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the conviction that strong-focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that team colleagues must stand behind the injured Jack Wilsher in front of the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Werger stressed to Wilsher that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is planned, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilsher will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and, in view of his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame in this current problem is that Wilsher had long ended the last season after a separate bone injury and then returned to his old swing during the previous season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten your career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that doesn't heal well.
That's no big deal.
It was just an accident.
It was not related to his buttons or to the injuries he had previously suffered.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wilsher since his debut six years ago.
He also played 157 league games in just 65 of Arsenals in the last five times.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six of eight times since 2007/08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have most days of injuries to record.
Werger accepts the potential of a hell crisis, but Arsenal believes that there will be an improvement in the injury rate during the last season.
"Sometimes when you get back from an injury, you have an offensive period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the battle force," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to overcome it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is running a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not traveling to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and the players who need it to be able to take a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to move on through Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most fearsome places in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeatable after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake, measuring on the judge scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Werger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lessons from the last season with the Champions League Capitulation against Monaco and is still driven by the distant hope of leading the association with its management to its first EuropeanPokal Triumph.
"This drive is huge," Wenger said.
It's never hit at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're greedy, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how to open up the need for men, now even more desperate than ever before, how suicide murders among young men prove on a 15-year-old high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and it remains three times more common for men than for women.
In an effort to address the problem, the campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM campaign against a miserable life) 2015 announced as the year of man, with the goal of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A current study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressed symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "stupid mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halfs the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on substance style, the immediateness of the response is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital lives have the need to appear strong, life-satisfying and successful, doubled, even though in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which has a far deeper impact on our spiritual health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was defined, not by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of football in cozy chairs and Ross's longing for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it at any rate, even though they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of the phone soul care explained to me: "My role as a listener for people who are depressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old talk "I come right with it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk openly about problems."
Friends are one of the shows that makes sense to me when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
It presents very clearly the small moments of male friendships.
So much my objective external status over the phone can also help people in times of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you visit this weekend's Comedy Central FriendsFest with the completely redesigned music of the day, why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or even better if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the total 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG destroy Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matudi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass through Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who led the French champion on the way, but then they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani achieved a headball in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish masters, as they are not only seeking the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate. He was later replaced in the game against his home city team and against the club with which he started his illustrative career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League. So it's a good start to win 2:0 to cause our opponents problems and relax, even if there are certain things we still have to perfect during the season," Blanc said.
"That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven't reached one or two more doors yet."
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned in one of three changes to the Paris team, which on the weekend could keep a 2:2 undecided in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was expelled in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine bird storm was referred to as the man who can take the PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United, and he explained why when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before passing through Johan Wiland in the long corner of the network.
But if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, it was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, attacked at Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who traveled far to Kevin Trapps Posts in the 34th minute pass, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG himself sometimes gave up, with some misconceptions and bad conclusions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who, in no less than five trials, was put up alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had used him after restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more fit when he brought his fellow players into play, and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic, who turned Di Maria into a turn shot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour-mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan reached its sixth seasoner after Ibrahimovic had picked up a left flag from Maxwell.
This ended up all the thought that Malmö could get back into the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the outcome down before replacing player Ezequiel Lavezzi opened a door at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later said that PSG played a class about his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was last December.
Since then, we have played only in the Swedish League, which has not the same level.
The qualification games are not enough."
Hut from Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion for stock sales
The Glencore mining giant in Switzerland, which is affected by rising raw materials prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt recovery plan.
The London registered company Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as China’s economic downturn is pushing demand and distorting markets.
The issue of rights of reference led to a sharp increase in the London Stock Exchange's peak in the early Wednesday trade.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay about a third of his $30 billion debts.
The company sold the new shares to 125 Pence each share, which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on the final course on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term blocked growth in China have decreased iron prices by around half, coal, copper and other raw materials prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a most long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The latest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis, the first official in Washington, takes place on September 25th and sends President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The President of the United States and First Lady Michelle Obama will also be guests of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening, after the two Heads of State have held bilateral talks.
"Chairman Xis visit will offer the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to deal constructively with areas of opinion" the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is likely to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before he goes to New York City to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged cyberspionage of China and its increasing self-awareness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

A 29-year-old wanted to complete a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway, the evil wake up.
With a company in the Gotha district, you can complete the dream and borrow and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 PS.

The damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was apparently only a few years ago before Spain's superstar Xavi, who played for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Pokal, four times Champions League winners, two times club world champions, two times European champions, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is amazing.
In the summer the currently 35-year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
However, in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now tells us that he was already before the EM 2008 before leaving Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we didn't," he says.
And so did the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer of Bayern."
"Rummenge wanted me."
Remember: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change didn't stop.
And the striking man today works for the German recordmaster: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has contracted Guardiola and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's playtime 2008/2009 would have been with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the fourth final of the Champions League against the Bayern over the entire distance on the race, turned off the red (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrated the King's Class Triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity in filmmaking down
Matt Damon confronted African American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she would not be needed behind the scenes.
During a sequence of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, experienced actor Brown interrupted when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the selected project's spinbook.
"When we talk about diversity, then do it when the film is filmed and not when the show is filmed," said Damon.
Brown responded shockedly, with political disbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the comments of the actor of The Martian got stuck.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of harmony," Brown said first.
The only black person, and she is a benefit that will be beaten by her white supplier.
The producer of Dear White People took part in the film for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the director's rights; Damon pointed out that their director "may at last give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was sparked, the social media exploded before discontinuing about Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - this is SO WEISS that it hurts".
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After the young man Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved national impact and forced legislators and authorities to offer discriminatory practices against colourful content.
In February the singer Prince made a presentation on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", (Albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still matter.
In more recent times, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement, as a response to the question of Fox-News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be viewed as a hate group.
"The Network Black Lives Matter is a love group," said the leaders.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already met the pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crown first champion
Professional sports climber and operating aid Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the $1 million big price home.
The competition show, which just ended its seventh season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle par course.
During the season finals, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten made it to the finals.
The last task involved climbing on a 75 foot long climbing line in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within the time when he was the first athlete to complete the pressing phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero ended this challenge three seconds faster than he did to win.
Caldiero talked to E!News after the hard win, still under the shock of winning the Great Price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed went with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prizes.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, it gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's talking about any of this.
He's just as happy to have done what he did.
Lots of awards he got from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed their roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eight staff, which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers Swallow Minnesota Twins Over
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
Previously they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers were reduced to their role as Spoiler, but this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with 5-4 in the target field.
The Twins spent a chance to rise within a half of Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard square.
For Detroit, although only for one evening, it was a return of the three letters F-word, which was so difficult to capture over a large part of the second half of the season.
"Every victory makes fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon held up his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to end this year strongly," said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that's why I want to go completely concentrated into the game.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three matches and was in two runs, his first RBI since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Marines on July 6.
"He has swung the wood well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at the (slaughing) training, looked much better at the bullpen, and he brought it directly into play.
With three runs at the meeting at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Field Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Field Aaron Hicks achieved a color, and Simon brought his second Brian Dozier Baseman to strike out before he was replaced by the left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Waller, the only man with whom he was confronted, in front of the appointed Rookie-slagman Miguel Sano, who entered the right hand Drew Verhagen a two-run.
With a couple of runners and the final run at the second Verhagen, the third baseman Trevor ploffe brought to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League that a double play hit the track
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Waller created a double RBI against the sealers of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the level of 5-4.
The right hand, however, stood Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a still unmoved Phil Hughes to launch the game.
The tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-hand vet who had been removed from the injured list before the game after he had missed more than one month due to a back injury.
"Probably not the beginning that I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt better than I did and felt that I would create some pretty good Pitches there in the third inning."
After they first received the leadoff battery, Hushes gave up a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the score position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third, which ended the threat.
The tigers added in the second, one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center Field Anthony Gose to the 3-0.
"That was a great blow," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't do very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, achieved no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reliefr's right hand A.J. After.
At Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a four-stroke walk.
COMMENTS: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez separated due to an injury to the throw shoulder.
He is being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list due to a fall in shoulders, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris will be removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four beginnings with the tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He's been missing since August 20th due to a fracture in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to stay in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people involved are then to be accommodated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday.
She counted between 450 and 750 arriving refugees.
Several spores of the Hesse capital were prepared in the past days for this case.
Up to 1,000 refugees can stay temporarily there.
They should then be further distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, according to the Government Bureau responsible for the first shooting, 7,500 people arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanoi have also set up emergency shelters in sporadic cities because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The leader of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria as an opportunity.
"I believe that the determined thought about military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He called on the European states to "collective detachment".
Four years ago it was a joy to have passed the Kelch of military participation in Germany.
"Now the conflict ends cracking at our door," he said in German radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees.
Austria controlled at the southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday at the Austrian TV station ORF, no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Neither did Germany send refugees back to Austria.
"No, it's so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement that could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
Concrete numbers she did not call and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria over the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Its target is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit next week.
Germany had started temporary border checks on Sunday.
So far, the EU States have not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
On Tuesday (September 22nd), EU Interior Ministers wish to take a new approach to the mandatory distribution of 120 000 more refugees at a special meeting.
In view of the strong refugee policy in Germany, the Federation wants to strengthen its support for the countries in the first capture and distribution of people.
The fed will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister at the Berlin Office on late Tuesday.
Mark stressed that those who need protection can also overcome them.
But those who do not have a living perspective cannot remain in Germany either.
This view was clearly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "great effort" of force.
Thousands of desperate refugees are now trapped on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175 km long border to Serbia during the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania should also be removed with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU other than Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent Slepper from seeking out routes across Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto to the planned new border zone.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
As a result, thousands of other migrants were on the way to the Greek border, according to eyewitness reports in Turkey.
Space probe "Cassini" finds Ocean on Saturnmond Enceledus
Under the ice panzer of the Saturn Moon, enceledus is a global ocean.
That concludes researchers from observations of the Cassini space probe.
The moon then wanders easily on its path around the Ring Planets.
Although this tidal movement is only small, yet too large for a constantly fixed celestial body, it is said in a message from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US-New York) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the magazine "Icarus".
It has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
Thus "Cassini" had already discovered 2006 ice volcanos at the southern pole of Saturn's moon, feeding the water vapor and ice particles and thus feeding the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least in the South Pole there must be a subterranean sea, the astronomers then closed.
However, the extension of the hidden ocean was not explained.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to give up about a month on offensive action Valdet Rama.
An investigation has led to an adjudication of the 27-year-old, the association reported.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich Lion, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced breaks".
"That's hard for us, Rama is a terrible loss."
"Of course we need to think about it now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Image" section with a view to the possible commitment of an unifying profession.
As a training guest, however, the Sixies first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was recently active in Belgium and was already under contract at the VfL Wolfsburg.
Croatia currently has "the opportunity to demonstrate its ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his brain failure.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national player will enter the race.
Okotie had injured himself in the party at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) at a severe meeting on the head.
In contrast to the first fears, however, he remained without a serious blasur.
No diet fruit - Mangos contain many sugars
Mangos are exotic and sweet.
But whoever wants to look at his slim line, it will be more often reported by them.
Because Mangos contain relatively much sugar - mainly sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. However, Mangos contains a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-carotine.
Therefore, those who eat the fruit support their physical strength, immune system and metabolic processes.
When buying, Mangos should not be too soft or firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within less days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or sweet food.
A mango, however, also gives a special note to honesthearted courts.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, birds, lamb and wild.
The U.S. Packing Service UPS provides up to 95,000 grants for Christmas business in the United States.
The company had already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
First of all, they're looking for a driver.
Already last year, UPS had increased its crew for the holiday season by 95000.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its rival FedEx have met earlier plans to be armed for the Christmas business since last year.
Late deliveries in 2013 had put in place tough criticism of package services.
First Féhnsturm, then marked cold front
On the next night, in the valleys of the north side of Föhn, the valley breaks through, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and Thursday night, the Föhn will blow partly with storm strength through the Föhntäller.
After the end of Thursday morning, we are surrounded by a marked cold front, which brings strong rainfalls, wind waves and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a Communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of a vast depth of printing area over the British islands in a strong south-west stream.
On the north side of the Alps, the valleys break through the valley at midnight.
As a result, the Föhn will blow until Thursday morning in the Föhtälarn with curves from 60 to 100 km/h, and especially in the Urnerland, in part also with more than 100 km/h.
The féhn can, by the way, advance to the neighbouring Mediterranean country, and even on the mountains are possible Orcanoes of over 120 km/h.
While in the north on the middle of the stormy féhn for summer temperatures of 23-27 degrees, the humidity begins to melt on the southern slope.
Here are some rains that stay until Thursday evening.
In total, the Alps have to be calculated south in the next 48 hours with a partial rain of more than 100 litres per square metre, which has already been the case in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the wind will rise, followed by a cold front with strong, partly wide-spread rain from West to East over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind is freshly up to stormy, and the temperatures are clearly going back.
The following days will be presented in the north in the autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, whereas in the south it will be sunny and warmer at weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther square
Almost 500 years after the reform, there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, an unprecedented place in the park was baptized on Wednesday on the oppio hill in the name of the German Reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Luthero" he is now honored as "German Theology of Reform".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name was applied by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes had often been able to live their faith as a minority only in hiding.
With the place it becomes symbolically visible that its tradition of Christian belief has been welcomed in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustinian monk in Rome for a few months.
He felt the city back then as a fallen sinner.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him, according to historians, in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the evening church with his thesis against the embassies.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) dorne kroner is one of the main works that Otmar had painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
Was that the word at first?
No, not in the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now appeared with beautiful images.
At first it was the image of Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and fantastic shapes has been received by the 75-year-old - but it does not matter in any way with "usual" images.
On the contrary: adapted to each subject, it may seem quite darker.
For about three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the "Book of All Books".
There are cycles that are devoted to such topics as crossroads, plagues, commandments or father-in-laws.
In doing so, he has spontanely fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publisher with his theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publisher with his focus on art books.
And there is especially the author Klaus Altepost, who has separated himself from the respective Bible sites on the basis of painting.
He interpreted the Bible sites selected by Otmar Old and thus "translated" to today in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible site of Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry band has gold letters.
Thus the 75-year-old alike allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were at last triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant order of Lord Hutter.
"The education has already happened with the pipestock," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to do this to perhaps bring me back to the Lord Father."
His second concern was to help art once again to increase its value: "The perception of image worlds today is marked by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is forced.
Artists have another desire and desire to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this regard, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "infiltrate" into the images, let them affect themselves, discover and feel what power they have: "The image is looking for against it".
Klaus Altepost was present on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "always" being a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Old ones did not respect the Bible’s full grasp of it, but they chose important, also mysterious subjects for it.
"It was not cooperation at eye height," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures the text explains only".
For Hans Möhler of Luther's publishing, this work is an invitation to "to deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak both the (bible) language of love and the responsibility for möhler.
Part of the original - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November at the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Construction start for BMX track close
Plans made, space found, company ordered, flooring modeled for a course: A year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX railway was thus closed again.
Lacks in politics and administration were responsible for Verdrusss, especially for the residents who did not want to take the train.
So the hills were shifted, new space sought - now with formal planning and application for construction approval.
The permit will be granted in October, the first municipality of Sabine Mosbach-Bock was now able to notify the Committee on Children and Youth.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It should then be started without "wider memory break" with the works at the former bathroom.
DFB Intensified commitment for refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees by 2019, and the Bundesliga places a clear sign on the weekend.
The football reacts to the suspicious situation in Germany and the policy ensures its help in dealing with the problems facing us.
"I have considered this to be the greatest challenge in our country since the reunification."
"No one in principle can say that I have nothing to do with it."
"This must interest everyone to get this issue under control," said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At his annual meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I'm in the office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"Then the topic will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football can and will help.
But the decisive weaknesses have to be the policy.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its "1:0 for a welcome" initiative for four years.
"About the Egyptian Brown Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach said at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal lists also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professionals are setting a clear sign when they wear the impression "We help - #refugeeswelcome" instead of the other usual sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone is going to help where and how they can only," said Leverkusen Sports Manager Rudi Völler of the "Image" edition (today) and described the project as "self-understanding".
"The refugee drama goes on everyone, nobody can see away."
"We can help many of the people who have suffered so incrediblely," said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the League".
On Friday, the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community of German football".
The fact that all 36 license associations had started their own projects in their places is great.
It is equally great that smaller and smaller associations are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have published, is lived in football.
"That is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and next year, together with the DFB selection and the federal government, the Association will provide EUR 300,000 for the integration of refugees.
"The associations have already withdrawn the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP Chief of Staff loses an eye in the event of an accident
The head of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, reportedly lost his left eye by a crash at the beginning of July.
In the case of an accident on the stairs at his brother's house in the United States, after midnight he fell on a glass of water which he had carried in his left hand, reported the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He almost bled, was powerless, then slipped out on the street - that's how he told us last week," says the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott can do his job.
"In early October we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager is at the meeting and is "full-fledged".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutschen Zeitung" (Süddeutsche Zeitung), he will come back to Germany in October and lead the software groups further.
"I'm full for SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its President Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually hangs between Germany and the USA, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP centre in Walldorf.
It was important for him to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can do something like that."
"It's important to get up again when you fall."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen except fight ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was hit by the wheel.
So he comes to Singapore in the evening of the weekend as little as a reserve driver for the two tribal pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the Japan Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without giants against Krasnodar: field in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have been completely shattered.
The national player will also miss the Table Leader of the Football Bundesliga in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (9.00 p.m./sky).
"We can't take him back, unfortunately," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be at the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen again on Sunday, the BVB coach said: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
Given the high load of his professional, Tuchel will not only change his tribe on the giant position.
So he announced a change in the position of the torhüter.
That's why Roman Wiedenfeller takes the place of the tribekeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, if fieldes are to be used in all European league games in the future, tuchel left open.
With high probability he will also fight the second party.
The research statement by fellow players Reus that the final entry for the BVB in Europe League must be the target, Midfielder Julian Weigl says: "Marco is not so wrong with this."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robote cars: Government wants to play a leading role for Germany
Germany is expected to be technological forwarders after the will of the federal government to change the car.
The Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA Auto fair from a "new mobility timer".
The automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less stasis," Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his G7 officials, who also meet with industry representatives on the IAA.
The Department of Transport's strategy paper highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a gradual transition to digital radio.
To test new techniques, a test track is currently being created on the 9th motorway in Bayern.
In order to ensure that the driver is "no additional liability risks", the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany intends to make an international effort to increase the permissible maximum speed for self-propelled cars from 10 to 130 kilometres.
The Federal Government also wants to make use of an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car increasingly takes over the driving, the driver becomes more and more passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
After a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics, high-automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, unmanned vehicles on public roads were "to be expected long after 2020".
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and high-automated driving functions in Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital network of the car can lead to more security and efficiency in road transport," said SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the driver's personal data had to be clearly clarified.
Yet the Germans see self-driving cars skeptically - much more than French or American.
A survey of the Forsa Institute presented on Wednesday at AA on behalf of the inspection organisation Decra results that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will be implemented in the next ten years, 32 percent only in 20 years so that 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of the people surveyed by 2025 have autonomous cars, 33 percent in the United States.
Nevertheless, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely fully on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire journey on all roads.
On the motorway, the figure could still be 15 percent in the flow of traffic, 45 percent in the Stau.
Well, every fourth would not leave control to the car under any circumstances.
Bolt says team start and double start at table tennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to strike only in individual battles from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"That's a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight at that time to a long-term agreed sponsorship term in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"No Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favourite," said single European master Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who led the set list in Jekaterinburg, also remembered the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Timo was missing at that time too, and we became European champions."
"We should be guided by that," explained the fifth world rankings.
The English national football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has drawn a serious injury to the right leg.
At the Champions League game at the PSV Endhoven, the defender was met at a touch of Héctor Moreno and was replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis showed a break in the 20-year-old partner of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a growing-figure Grusel cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: Showster dolls, which thanks to video projections look scary to humans.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became, among other things, Madonna's stage outfit to the great star of fashion scenes - and so he put men in dress.
"I can't say today that I'm the terrible child of skin care because I have white hair."
"It was faded before, it's true in the meantime," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk to The Catwalk" (From the Citizens' Step on the Race) which is to be seen in the art hall of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation of 18 September, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial negative attitude into a show about his person.
In fact, he was on the other hand, for he said, "For me, an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
If you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been done in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the art hall, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly yet transparent work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed overall art for which much effort has been made: for example, in order to fry the dolls, for example, a stylist was engaged.
14 tons of material have driven the makers according to the claims of the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the October party, there was a special taster: a leatherwear outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different," said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy is also visible at the exhibition.
He stands for the first, famous fashionable attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football) he drew his Teddy BHs and clothes, Gaultier said.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The design of fashion he later joined himself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, I bought it, of course.
For his first fashion show he couldn't pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they could keep the clamps.
Jewelry instead of Garden - Plauener tipze as fashion niche
It used to be in and out of the long slot machines to make meters.
The glued materials and tips were produced in large quantities for customers who, for example, further processed to roofs and gardens.
This alone does not work anymore today, says Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of Modespitze Louen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
The fashion played a larger role in the early days of the Plauen peak, was then driven by the domestic textile industry - and is now discovered as a niche.
Reinhardt calls some examples: tops in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional suits.
In any case, the so-called vintage mode, which is based on past style pockets, is an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they're already doing half of all the jobs.
Modespitze Louen is a member of the Plauener Spitze and Stickerreien industry with nine other companies.
Only they can wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have been lost.
Private trades and even wholesale are almost no longer available.
Our products hardly reach customers on this path.
The mass goods are now produced much cheaper in the Asian space and are distributed almost exclusively through chains.
In addition, exports are slowing down, currently going to Russia and to the USA.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to point out by environmental awareness how Cordula Bauer explains from the stick bead in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have been running a quality seal, which shows that we are producing environmentally and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Ute Schmidt, a diploma designer, teaches at the Schneeberger outpost of the West Saxony University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in embroidery and tips.
In order to counter competition from the Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension field between the latest ideas of designers and the companies that need to think especially economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly different in order to keep a customer strain.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuters relived the historical snowball peak.
The machine is stuck in some places to small balls.
The Plauen goldsmith master Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before I couldn't begin anything with traditional Plauen top".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In a heavy procedure, it marks the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuters.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in meadows and surrounding areas who want a piece of memory.
That's why I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen peak.
Disney Plants New "Mary Poppins" Film
You shouldn't touch legends, but Disney is still watching a new movie by his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to " Entertainment Weekly", it is not about a new film, but about a kind of continuation that is played 20 years after the first movie with the magic girl.
This is the experience of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins for more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already standing firm: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi insists on opening the economy wider for the world
The economy needs to open more widely outside to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday a group that was commissioned to steer the reform.
"China should work towards attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business-based strategies," he said in an appeal at the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
To promote new foundations and advance reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access arrangements, the relaxation of border control policies, the promotion of public enterprises (SOEs), private capital, and the overhaul of the population reporting system.
Following the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not in question for investment.
The system is tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it places a greater role on the market in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also relax controls on the powers transferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will be allowed to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open State-controlled sectors, further areas are open for private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their activities and to appoint professional judges and public prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also participated in the meeting, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double the mercury limit in raw fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large ruminant fish and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of neurotoxicity.
The Foodwatch consumer organisation, which has a relevant EU working paper, criticised the plans sharply: "The risks and side effects of poor industrial and environmental policies are being further extended with full attention to pregnant and young children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shark or swordfish for "economic policy reasons" are to be raised by one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily burdened with mercury that about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold on the basis of the existing limit values.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be non-salesable.
In contrast to this closure, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to increase the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams currently to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, referred to this as "Trick", because smaller Pacific fish, such as carpfs, are mostly so low that they already observe the planned maximum values today.
The decrease in small fish is therefore "a perfect manipulative approach that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt explained.
Quecksilber is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched above the food chain especially in raw fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "almost few already can cause "in particular unborn damage to the nervous system".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment, however, states on its homepage that there is no "health hazard of the general population" to be expected.
Quacksilber is mainly achieved by coal burning into the environment.
According to a written statement by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal plants came to the Greens-Berbock for more than six tons of mercury per year, two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhein and Donau, was "permanently and superficially exceeded", the "reflection" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, European warnings against mercury in fish already included the most frequently reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
