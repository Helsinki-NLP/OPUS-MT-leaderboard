The World’s Violations
Market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well and shouts and colds out in nature have gone to the world’s widest and widest reach.
"You have the colloquium, I need Iceland," says a woman outside the big world in comments on an announcement from the Looks Like You Need Iceland Marketing Army on YouTube.
Another eye - catching greeting will keep Iceland in its heart for all eternity, and a young woman says that she has to come to Iceland as her first tourist destination.
Sadly, however, she is in the United States, and she plans to have to wait for a month.
Another observer asks whether the route to Iceland is suitable, because there are no airplanes.
It does not follow the story of his coming from another time period.
Aggil Son of Thordars at the Peel ad office, which made the ad together with the M&C Saatchi international ad office, says more have been received.
“I came to many Inspired By Iceland soldiers who have gone very well but this new campaign is already underway.
Basically, this is about creating a PR value, it's getting foreign media to talk about the campaign, and it's been incredibly good.
At a relatively short time, we have had a circulation of some seven hundred media throughout the world, reaching nearly two billion people in total.
The value of the roundup is valued at $1.8 billion.
It's not polite."
The world’s main market is the United States, and the military has gone very well, even though Americans are not on their way to the country soon.
According to Egil, known market areas such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also benefited, such as Russia, who are pleasantly surprised.
There was a reaction from outside areas, such as India, which was not particularly developed.
"These advertisements have traveled beyond what we expected," says Egill, but it is possible that more than four million people have looked at the subject on YouTube.
"We couldn't have wished for a better start."
The images on the opening page were taken by Arni Säberg, the photographer of the Morning Newspaper, on an ad bearing the headline "Let It Out" in the middle of the last month.
The posts went out wide and wide, as at Reykjavík, in Reynsk, at the forest of Foss, at the Sollaim, and in the court of the chief of the guard.
Samuel Bjarki Peter’s son and Gunnar Paul Olafs son were playwrights at the Shoti productions and the adoptor of the Fear of the Son of God.
In part, it was the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
At the same time, the announcements were made in southern Ireland, and there was a second group in Western and Western lands.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is aimed at a winter campaign in cooperation with M&C Saatchi.
"This is only the first phase of this work for the Icelandic Chamber," says Egill, adding that the cooperation with M&C Saatchi has been extremely good.
“ It’s great to work with them.
In such a task, it is very important to have foreign employees with knowledge of the boundaries we are talking to."
Explosives: Focus on the labour market, biodiversity, and many more
Asmundra Einar Dadadash son of the councillor of society and children, meets in Sprandisand, starting at ten o'clock today in Bulgaria.
He is also a labour market adviser and talks about the position on the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and more.
He also talks about rural areas and the transfer of work to a land that has been bad and has been distributed for decades.
Tor Tor Ingolfsson, president of the VR, also takes part in the discussion, but he will discuss his criticism of the livelihood fund and suggests that labour movement and employees withdraw from the seas to reduce the risk of poverty.
Then they will be consulted by Ivar Ingimarsson, a travel minister in Eastland, and by Arnheii Johnsdot, the head of the Northern Market Office, about the location of the country’s travel service.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading ban on what is to come.
You can listen to the part below, but it starts at ten.
That's how it looks today 25 years later
The play by Elisha Donovan had a successful career in whatever form of youth.
However, she won the World Cup for her game as Amber in the film "Clueless" 25 years ago.
She also played in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
Little has been done, but she was able to look across the street and talk about Cleeness in the Australian television of the day.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I was building the person of the greatest number of girls I’ve ever met in schools that were not good to me.
As soon as I read the manuscript, I knew who this person was," Donovan said about his game in Clueless.
I didn't want to leave the police station after midnight.
About 50 cases were brought to the police station in the capital’s area today, and the police daily newspaper said that the case had been varied.
The day at the police station on the Kyrgyz Street began with the need for a police officer to have a deal with a man who had recently been released from prison after he died as a result of a computer accident.
If the man did not want to leave after he had been released, he would not listen to the police who told him to go away.
The man entered the police station for his progress.
At that time, one was arrested in the morning, suspected of burglary in a company in Kopavoga.
Police were also required to have two men in Broad Hall to be disbanded as a result of reports of physical assault.
Then, too, a woman sitting at a mall in Copenhagen was unable to pay for the meal at the end of the meal and was called to the police.
There was also a call for a car ride in the middle of the morning.
A white driver named Renault looked at her for moments and was then taken free.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Rejoicers — A Terrible Destiny of the Gleasers
This teaching has taken an interest in the Internet for the curse on the Glad Tidings series, but the playwright Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days and thus became the third major player in order to prolong life.
The songs, dances, and songs are a favorite feature of the Glee team.
The details of the so - called joys of young people in school, their love, and their destiny.
It was not always taken out of the chain to be in the happy camp, but through singing and dancing, the individuals seemed to be able to cope with every situation that arose in their lives.
In addition to places of employment, however, players and employees have suffered major hardships, so much so that the teachings have given rise to the curse on the subjects.
Naya Marie Rivera took part in the role of Santana Lopez, a runner who did not call all her grandmothers.
After the series had run its course, Rivera went to have the actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and divorced.
Dorsey, however, refused to submit a complaint and the domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8, it was reported that Riveru was missing after her four - year - old son was alone on a boat in Lake Pira, California.
The boy found himself sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and could tell the police that he and his mother had entered the pool and then Rivera had brought him back to the boat but had never returned there.
Started a lot of looking for Rivera.
The day after the look began, the police officer in the area found out that we were looking after Rivera had been drowned.
Five days later Rivera was found and publicly executed.
It is believed that she has fallen into a great stream of water and has made new her final demands to save her son.
The cause of the accident was recorded.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took part in the performance of Finn Hudson, the American footballer with the Anglo - American World Power, who played key role in bringing the Glad Tidings to glory and honor.
Nevertheless, Moneith did not give up on the part of a personal devil.
From the age of 13, he had been drugged and found it difficult to break free.
In 2013, his associates found enough time to get in, and he encouraged them to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and seemed to look better.
Only two months after finishing treatment, Moneith felt killed in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein proved to be a lethal mixture of ampoules and alcohol.
It was not considered to be volunteer work.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerability for measles had been reduced so much that the dose he had endured well before turned out to be fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His spirit was heavy upon his fellow workers, but his rival wife, Leah Michele, was determined to continue taking the part and sanctifying the whole of Moneith’s memory and of Finn’s person.
Mark Wayne Halling went with the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the subjects, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and he had little respect for his compatriots in the Gladys Army, or until he got the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles suspected of child pornography.
At home, he found a huge amount of child pornography, and the matter soon became public.
It was obvious that Salling had already been.
He was subsequently accused and accused of his crime.
He had been in prison for four to seven years, as well as for having to file sex offenders and seek treatment for child abuse.
Before the judge had decided the punishment, Salling, who was then released from prison, was found dead near his home.
The cause of money was suicide.
They were not just actors who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant manager.
In 2013, he fell asleep at only 41 years of age.
On the other hand, a woman named Nancy Motes also won.
She was the younger sister of the great star, Julie Roberts, and she did not like the story but blamed Robert for his great self - control and demeanor.
Motes took his own life in 2014 and coped with severe depression.
She left her letter to her widowed mother and sister, among other things, responsible for the way she was treated.
"My mother and so-called sister have nothing to do with me but the memory that they were the worst of my misery."
Lea Michel was the star of the actors.
Recently, she has been charged with using her associates ’ uniforms and crossings at the site and with passing astrologers.
Jesse Lukan took part in the 2012 event.
He was arrested and charged with computer attacks in 2019.
The play Heather Morris played a major role in the play.
Thus, in 2010 she found that unscrupulous computer exchangers came to her senses and posted on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the game and had a love affair outside.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had resorted to violence in his relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything
It increases children’s development when they play outdoors with their parents to grow flowers and watch them grow and grow.
It can also be done with flowers as shown by the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel.
Just having time for the children in the garden is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the smell, and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
Buying a boat after the tenth grade
"I don't think we're many sailors who work in the country's schools," says Axel Orn Dimmundsson, who spends the summer fishing, but studies psychology at the Island University in winter."
Beaches are a very comfortable summer job when you are in school.
If you fish well, you can have a good catch and I think it's great to be able to avoid taking a student loan.
They also make me feel good in the winter," says Axel Örn Dimmundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist who spends summer fishing like the previous summer.
Axel was the most recent brewer in Talknafrid when a journalist arrived late at the beginning of the week."
“The water I was in the tenth grade I took for ships under 12 meters long and bought my boat in the summer after I graduated from elementary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summer.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartman, son of Jon, and gave it his name.
Hartmann was an adult when I bought the boat and stopped going to sea, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat in three million.
“I made a deal with Hartmann to pay the half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer, but the other half at the end of summer when I was fishing.
So I had the boat unloaded at the end of this first summer."
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay off when he had recently graduated from high school?
“I had already set up and collected money, I had been working with my father when I was a boy, I was all summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my farm money into my boat."
Axel was born to Ishphor, where all his mother's people were; and he has lived in Coopavage since he was a child.
“I can catch here in the west because I have a house of law with my grandmother in Issafari.
I learned in this area from my father’s row west.
I'll go between far and wide, depending on how I feel, because this fishing area is all over the West.
Although I feel better about the west, I have also been given around the narrow valley and beyond.
I have also provided for the south, but then most graceful," says Axel, who always hits one morning and sometimes talks to the corn and sings to the sky, in unique times together on the sea.
“The connection outside the ocean is good, so I can call, listen to music and music.
I don't think it's a matter of being alone on board.
Of course I'm trying to avoid landing in a pond, but of course something has sometimes been done in the weather, but never at great risk," says Axel, who is lucky to never be sea sick.
He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishermen walk each time.
“I’ve never been fishing in the beach for more than 14 hours at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rent quota, but then I’ve been caught for one and a half hours in a row out on the sea fishing.”
He says that he is able to catch about 30 pounds [770 kg] a day, which he feels is a stumbling block.
“ Other obstacles are that I cannot catch on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I can only catch 12 days a month, these four months as the beaches pass, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, seamen should choose their fishing days by weather and no other.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to rest instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose from their heads.
So the changes in the area could also go on my own, and the place that is well placed with the fish should enjoy it," says Axel, who reduces most of the cod from the salty sea on its beaches, but also only the humid and unique other species flow with.
Axel works in winter with his university degree at the Nupi School in Copenhagen.
"I don't think we're many seamen working at the country's schools," says Axel proudly and adds that he only intended to work temporarily at the school.
“I am determined because I feel that this is a great job.
I hope that psychology will benefit me in the future," says Axel, who is also far from studying business.
An error occurred while saving to your home directory
An error in a record sheet that people fill when it comes to the country led to the fact that a person living in the country was not called back in a sample.
There is no requirement to register a student if the document is filled out in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
"This will be considered during the week," says a specialist in the field of agriculture.
Three internal infections were reported yesterday in the field of virologics in the Landspital.
One of those who proved to be positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the so - called homelessness rules were adopted.
Those who lived in Iceland were then screened at the arrival of the country and were again shown in the exhibition four to five days later.
In the afternoon news, however, Rúv came across that the person had been following the old system.
The scene on the border was negative, and it was not called back in the scan for the virus.
Kamilla Ruth Sigfusus daughter, a specialist in the field of agriculture, says in a press conference that this may lead to error in the electronic record.
Filling out the English edition is not a requirement to insert a textbook as is the case in the Icelandic edition.
After all, this was primarily the case for foreign travelers.
Therefore, the patient did not receive an automatic notification of the presence of a sample.
Camilla says that although many have followed the rules on homelessness, they have completed the English registration form and, in some cases, employers have also been alert to send people back to the theater after it arrived.
“ This will be considered during the week how to facilitate people’s access to it by raising their attention to the process. ”
The man is in solitary confinement, and six have been put in solitary confinement.
They all went to the theater, but two of them started showing symptoms.
The three infections reported yesterday are now underway, but it is largely over due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there is a variation of the coronary virus that has not been found here before.
In another case, the bonds have been more direct than Israel, although it is known that the person who moved the virus to the land had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that there should be tomorrow where the virus is coming from.
A total of 15 are now isolated according to COVID. is.
135 are in stock.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five internal injuries have been reported here in the past few days.
Four of them are completely unconnected and are not yet able to detect the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup yesterday.
Smashing is still ongoing.
Originally, on the third day, they were sent to a synagogue, but they were reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 are affected because of these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is a second time in a short time when sports events are diagnosed and questions have arisen about whether such events are happening.
John K. Johnson, a communications officer at the State Police Department, says that it is very slow, as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
“We are constantly caring for all those who live here that they need to maintain individual infections.
We also need to take care of those who are taking the lead in showing that there are certain rules in place.
Then it is possible to hold events," says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by holding on to the air of individual infections.
The rules and criteria are also in constant review.
“ What needs to be done, and what the public department and the medical department are constantly caring for people, is thinking about these individual infectious diseases.
Both at home and in the same way in service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents infection from going on," says John.
“We need to make sure that people continue on the good road we were on, so that they can keep up with the success we have achieved here.”
40% of the victims of COVID-19 had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how hard her father had to get his breath.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day he was dead.
The breathing was caused by sudden respiratory problems due to coronary infection.
Diabetes was described as a underlying problem and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is afraid of dying as if to go ahead.
The Reuters news station doesn't say the fear of Brumfield is unreasonable.
The number of new studies conducted by the U.S. government shows that 40% of those who died of diabetes had 2 diabetes as the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who did not reach 65 years of age is considered, the proportion increases to half.
A study of the U.S. cybercrime (CDC) found more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who lost their coronary virus in the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in CDC infectious diseases, says that the results are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their love.
The slow growth of Reuters was hidden and the responses from the 12 countries that responded to comparable proportions were reported.
10 kingdoms, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet reported underlying diseases.
“Sickness was already slowing down.
Now COVID–19 has broken down for a very powerful age," said Reuters after Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University.
Diabetes is more common among black people and people of South American origin, who have also worsened from the coronary virus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in the body’s pancreas, healthy diet, and help the health care professionals.
However, the coronation of the virus has made it difficult for many to keep routine for a week.
There has been a high insulin requirement for some to continue working and thus a risk of exposure to the virus.
Reuters points out that the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risk that those with diabetes 2 may be caused by the virus.
When the SARS Coronone virus passed in 2003, there were almost 20% of them with the disease, and in 2009 this group was three times more likely to be hospitalized.
When Mers did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to diabetes control.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because of the effects of the COVID-19 virus, for a long time, the age of childhood may have declined by the number of previously unknown complications.
"I'm afraid we'll see a flood of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, president of the International Association of Diabetes.
Doctors have been advised that the coronary virus cycle can indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, including kidney disease and renal impairment.
Just like new studies, the coronary virus can lead to an increased incidence of diabetes.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the coronary virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organisms that are already sick in many who have diabetes.
At that time, a high proportion of glucose and lipids in diabetic patients may produce a truly "cell messagestorm", as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Inflammatory congenital cells can also cause inflammation that can cause a fatal blood clot.
"This is all one big puzzle game," Dela Cruz says.
"This relates to all interfaces."
The news has been corrected.
"We were invited to champagne, so they left the room"
The wife of Asrún Magnusdott and Atli Bollason attended the unusual prayer of the artist Ragnar Kjartans son to engage in sex in front of a camera for the work that the artist had been putting up in Paris.
"We loved each other so this wasn't complicated."
So Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and mother - in - law, the daughter of Azrun Magnus.
“I was very fond of her.
It was, of course, just the radiation, but it also made me feel totally unheard of.
And I'm still sorry," he says.
In turn, the husband remembers this too, and he regularly repeats his first encounter.
“I always hear this story.
Only last weekend," she says, who also met her husband at first.
“I felt and felt so excited around Atlanta that I liked it.
There's a lot going on and a lot of things going on, and I'm going to be happy about it."
Atli says that they have emphasized the importance of walking in their own ways.
“We don’t have to pack our bags as well as our companions.
We avoid the routines that we're discussing around us."
That may be why they took the album from Ragnar Kjartan’s Son to the artist’s delight, even though it would be most unusual to say so.
“Christina Anna, our mutual friend, has contact with us and asks if we can come and eat dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibärga, Ragnar’s wife, on Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met with the three - year - old Snaps, and received their dessert and their each meal.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his art show program, which he thought he would set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris during the fall.
“He had a variety of video works called Scenes from Western culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Asrun says that he described his work as a banal and decadent late from the day - to - day life of the Westerner.
“He had sketches of all the time he was going to shoot and he finally told us about what he wanted us to know if we were interested in participating.”
Later, when Ragnar asked the couple to join him in showing young intersperses to love each other in a minimal room.
"These are conversations with the beginning and the end," says Atli.
The couple did not know her very much, although they knew about her and her husband, “but they knew us, and they felt at ease in this.
They said that they did not want to advertise in public.
Perhaps they thought that they would not have the right people but people who would have sexual pleasure in performing for others."
They took Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it did not take long.
“ When we ran out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Are we not just there?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and all his team," says Azrun and Atli.
“This is about love and closeness”
Later, it was picked up in a nice apartment on the Myrgar Street.
There was very little filming; a receptionist, Ragnar, and a musician, and the couple.
After the shooting, everyone left the room to wait outside for a car other than Atli and Azrun.
“We didn’t decide what we should be.
We received some brief instructions, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be ignorant of what we are doing and to each one.
It was nothing, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Asrun.
But was that romantic?
"Yes, this was a little romantic," says Atli and Azrun agree.
“We were invited to campavin before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the couple’s performance in the work that moved them.
“ When Tommy looked at this, he cried, and he felt so beautiful, ” says Atli.
"This is as much about love and closeness as the conversation itself," says Asrun.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and have told Atli that his mother heard the voice in her son at the Reykjavik List and then realized that he was part of the work.
“ Then she looks back and goes into this, ” says Atli.
“Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone about this, but just sending my dad a message and saying, "It's nice to have a little family in Palais de Tokyo," Asrun recalls.
And would participation in the work have deepened the relationship between Asruna and Atlas?
“We’re still together anyway, so maybe it’s a little deeper.
This deepened my relationship with the family," says Asrun and laugh.
Asrun himself saw the work at the Cup Hall with his colleague.
"I found it a little difficult not to be with you but to be with someone else," she says and turns to her husband.
“ But it’s nice to see this because it’s only a little late in much larger work, and when you see it with the other things, it’s really great.
I could get a little bit out of this and I was just proud.
And there was a little corn in my stomach," says Asrun, who was pregnant with another child of the couple when she was taken up.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to the Azruna and Atlas in the Love stories of Rase 1.
Swansea with victory in the first sub-colored game
Swansea won a 1-0 victory at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the team in the subterfuge to appear in the English Selection Department.
The game took place at Swansea's home in Wales.
The position in the radius was 0-0.
Homers in Swansea were informed in 64 minutes, but Andre Ayew broke the archaic from the point of view and was released.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, a player in Brentford, got the red card.
So Brentford played the rest of the game less and in 82 minutes the useful Swansea players took part.
Andre Ayew then added the whitehead by scored a great goal and won Swansea 1-0.
So Swansea leads 1-0 into the single, but the second game will take place next Wednesday at Brentford's home.
Unmanaged for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. missionary in Iceland, is in the caste of media after CBS found out this morning that he wanted an armed lifeguard where he was afraid of his life.
However, it has not been easy for the president of the United States to order missionaries here.
Since Carol Van Vorst resigned from the United States Missionary Office in April 2009, she has been completely independent in the country for over 62 months, over five years.
Van Vorst left his office under special circumstances, but Kastlüs reported that since 2009, she had been given the Order.
Following a greeting with the president of Iceland, she received a telephone call from the president’s office of the material that she would not be ashamed of the word.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international trade with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Vorst’s successor came to work in September 2010.
There may be some reason why Robert S. Connan had been appointed as a missionary but then stopped.
Finally, Louis Ariega had been serving in the foreign field for decades.
He left his assignment in the autumn of 2013 and took up missionary work in Guatemala.
Then another time period was set.
Robert Barber received US approval in January 2015 and came to work shortly thereafter, but then no messenger had been on the scene for 13 months.
Barber was a political leader but not a diplomat, but he had served as a lawyer and a short voter for Barack Obama.
He quit his job as soon as Donald Trump took up the presidential office on 20 January 2017, as is the custom of political-appointed ambassadors.
The Trump government was unusually ordered by both missionaries and by officials in Washington.
So two years later, at the end of his meeting, the U.S.A., Jeffrey Ross Gunter asked him questions and confirmed his credentials as a missionary in Iceland.
In his testimony to the deceased, he said he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who was killed, had been broken from the Dutch mountain.
Gunter is a political figure, was previously a skin doctor in California and has been prominent in the republican Jewish Coalition.
The playwright Sheldon Adelson founded them, but Adelson is a zealous supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no shipowner had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example of the country.
The reason is that the Trump government has been appointing key officials and that in recent years the United States has been working very long, including the confirmation of ambassadors in office.
Since 2009, therefore, Iceland has been unmanaged for more than five years.
However, this has not prevented the conduct of the mission council, which opened its new headquarters in Antioch.
The performances are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the narrow-locked safety wall turns the building around and the shot glass is in all windows.
However, it seems that they have not yet filled the current security of the consignor because he is said to be afraid of his life and has wished for an armed lifeguard.
Former IBV player for racism in Iceland - “It was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tonny Mawejje, a former IBV player, says that he was a racist when he was in Iceland and that he saw that he had come to the country.
This is shown in an interview with Tony, who appeared on the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tony recently joined the Ugandan Police FC team playing in the top of Uganda.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tony talks about a lot, including his time here in the country, while he played with IBV, Val, and Dótti in Iceland.
“ When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle like I used to.
The last member of the team was in that position, but he was also with the number of three I wanted so I didn't get any of what I wanted," Tony says, but he played on the right-hand corner at the IBV game.
One of Tony’s talks is racism that he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when playing in Europe.
“ This happened to me once, but since I did not understand the language, I simply ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the matter and then asked my friend what it was all about.
He said to me, 'My adversary has brought an evil report against me after I have crucified him.'
In 2014, Tony moved from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he has made the mistakes he sees as much as possible.
Tony had not made it to Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get to the country.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland for a loan, and he went with them to Val.
“ It was a mistake to return to Iceland on a loan.
I think if I had been in Norway for a while, I would have had the opportunity I wanted," Tony says, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would probably get longer.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has made up his dreams of reaching the greatness of Europe.
Finding worms in the neck of a woman
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8 miles [3.8 km] of black worm in the neck of a woman who was looking there.
The doctor was able to pull the worm out with his tongue.
A study revealed that mammals were being discussed.
CNN explains this.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashi, which is minced.
The woman quickly improved after the worm was removed, but insects such as these are often in quick meat or fish.
After Sushi has moved to bed in the Western world, cases of insect bites have increased according to CNN.
Fear of Other Waves Starting in Europe
Spain is now in a burning state in connection with concerns about another wave of the Coronal Virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to re-launch the spread of the Coronal Virus.
In Catalonia, all fun lives have been set on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona, where we are increasingly infected.
Other European countries have also taken action because of the proliferation of Spanish infections, but in Britain everyone needs to go on a trip from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned about travel to Spain.
In addition, infections are increasing again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance between halting the spread of the virus and restoring economic life.
However, the location in Europe is good compared to elsewhere in the world, but the recent global infection is close to 300 thousand a day, with the largest infection in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infections have become 16 million worldwide, according to John Hopkins University, and there are deaths that are confirmed to be associated with the virus of 644 thousand.
Mosaic works can eventually be enjoyed to the fullest
In front of the temple in Reykjavík is a large and deep cave.
There are men with orange helmets on top of it.
There's also a big grave.
And more less machines.
The gate is closed for traffic.
But the hall is well - equipped, and there many are now standing and respecting the artwork of millions of mosaic tiles — just as they had never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it's not worth it.
The work here has been somewhat obscured, right in front of it were driving conditions that have always been occupied.
People lay there, locked the car in a hurry, and jumped out of town.
"Live and multi-variable public space" and "accommodating urban space" are the guiding points for the rehabilitation of the security road that is now under way.
The goal is to enhance the beauty of the area and allow the mosaic work of Gerda Helgadottur to enjoy a better view.
In front of the work, there will be a market, and since the area is good at the sun, it is considered suitable as a sleeping area for street passengers.
The work of art will be described and now the material will enjoy itself better than before on this 142 - square - foot [142 sq m] field.
In the area there will also be small "twisted", some kind of water sculptures that offer play and give the area a certain cloud.
In this way, the replacements are described by the city of Reykjavík, which is being carried out along with Veit.
Water, heat, and electricity will be refurbished.
Many of them have come to their age, but the school curriculum and the cold water law have been in 1925 and have thus served the people and businesses of the Middle Ages.
Once the street is reopened, vehicles can drive around it again.
However, it will become unique and gradually create a calmer and more accessible space for walking.
Tollhouse on the customs office’s Web site says that the house was used in 1971, and its architect was Gisli Halldorsson.
Because the seaboard reached through the house, a 250 - foot [250 m] windowless wall was formed on the street.
The Building Committee and architect agreed that such plots would have a bad effect on the overall structure, if no specific arrangements were made to smooth the appearance of the house.
So members agreed to calculate by setting up permanent works of art.
At that time, a lot of words went out of the collection by Gerdy Helgadotur, an artist’s wife.
She had worked hard at mosaic works in Germany and abroad.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether to compete for the job.
Often, it was said that the work had to reflect life on the sea, and the sea had been a life of Reykjavik since it was made.
When she spoke to the artist, she became the subject of such a work.
It was necessary for her to receive drawings and other help before returning from a foreign land, where she would work with the foreign suggestions.
When she returned home, she made some suggestions for a discussion.
She was immediately allowed to ask her to work.
It was also requested to conclude an overall agreement with it and the famous art firm in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, but Gerd had long worked with them to set up famous works of art across Europe.
The contract was concluded, and Gerd worked under the installation of the brothers ’ workshop, who then saw the installation of the Tollhus.
All the work was particularly well done, as said in the summary, by both the half of the Helgadout and the Oidtmann brothers.
Since then, an unprecedented Icelandic climate has taken place.
In 1972 and 1973, it took Gerda about two years for the work to be done.
The listaconan died two years after the completion of the Tollhus, only 47 years of age.
Preparing to move more institutions to land
Assmond, son of Einar Dadajas, announces that several public institutions will be transferred to the country next.
This was said by the chief of intelligence in Bulgaria this afternoon.
Recently it was reported that the firefighting area of the Home and Human Resources Agency will be transferred north to the Strait of Sheep in the autumn.
Six experts in the field of burnout work at the establishment but none of them intend to follow the establishment north and the National Association of Disposal and Disease Transfers has criticised the Buffer Transfers.
“I think we should take further steps in this universe.
I am preparing further steps in this universe.
More transport," Asmundur said.
He is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more distribution of public agencies around the country.
"I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public works to the country, as I was doing with the Housing and Human Resources Agency," said Asmundur, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been transferred to the country and played a major role in society abroad, such as the transfer of the Food Foundation to Selfoss, the Land Survey of Iceland to Akranes and unemployment insurance on the Skaga Beach.
All the most from the second day of the Master's Meeting
94. Iceland’s championship in free competition ended at Torsvelli in Akureyri today.
Some antiseptics were introduced on the second day of the race.
An exciting match was held in the women’s battle in Torswell, but Vigdís Jóns daughter from FH set Icelandmet in the battle in 2014 which lasted until Elizabeth Ruth’s daughter from IR improved her assessment in May last year.
Wigdhis worked the Icelandic plague back in the summer and has been fantasize about the latter, but it has tripled the Icelandic plague.
Elizabeth Ruth has been stricken with pain and has not reached the point of her life today.
She had only one drop of five, threw 25,69 feet [25,69 m] away from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 feet [60.08 m] in her last attempt, and set the stage.
In July, she had a 60 - foot [62.69 m] Iceland strike, and she was still a bit of it.
The goddess Caritas Hallgrim’s daughter from IR had the next best throw on the day, but she improved her best shot by up to 50,18 feet [50,18 m].
In a male group, the FHman won the Hilmar Örn Jónsson, an Icelandic battalion, a sure victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his next drop and set a counterweight.
Its ice - cream mark in the article is 75.26 feet [75.26 m].
The God Valur Goddess Son, Olympius, and the Iceland Metastasus, won a ball game last night at Torsvell, but today he competed in a circuit that is his main theme.
The iceberg of Val’s Gods is 65,53 feet [65,53 m], but it dropped at a distance of 59,13 feet [59,13 m] today and secured its victory.
Valdimar Helti Erlandsson was thrown next to us today, but he had one drop as he could in the 2nd seat, 15 feet [49.43 m].
Haddís Security daughter, Iceland’s long jumper, won the long jump with surpluses, but haddís jumped at a distance of ten feet [6.25 m] today, which is less than 40 cm [40 cm] from its Iceland.
In a 200-metre race of women, it was the IR Godfather Jona Bjarnadottar who was bombed, but she scored 24.04 seconds, but her Iceland MET in the article is 23.45 seconds.
The Goddess Jonah was victorious in Akureyra, but she won two gold medals yesterday, 100 meters running and 4 x 100 meters running and then also 4 x 400 meters running today.
In a male group, Kolbein Häder Gunnarsson of FH was the first to score 200 meters in the race of 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Oliver Māna Samuelson of Armenia.
Like God - fearing Jonah, Kolbein’s hair won gold in 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meters race.
Don't blame for the 27 million crowns of Bitcoin crop
The Super-Tax Board has rejected the requirement of a tax investigator who was charged with crimes against a person in order to devalue his financial assets that came due to the sale of the Bitcoin electric coin.
The Board concludes that the tax officer would not have provided a clear explanation of why it was necessary to punish a person.
The Board’s judgment shows that the tax administrator considered that the person was in a position to distinguish materially from the tax returns due to the years 2016 and 2017.
He would have misused his financial resources that would have resulted from the sale of the Bitcoin power coin to 27 million, whether willing or not.
The guilty man is guilty of his conduct.
So the man refused in a letter to the committee.
In 2016, however, he managed to sell electricity for 27 million dollars.
She would have been buried in the years 2009 and 2010 when she had both been easily and uninhabited by a normal household arrangement.
He then pointed out that when he sold the coin, it would have been taxable because of such a sale had been very light and unpredictable.
It could hardly have been expected that the general public would be aware of such tax practices.
He would not have been willing to pay taxes on the crop and would have made his property known in advance as an interface to a monetary account.
He would have asked both scholars and government prosecutors about how this was done but not successful.
Then he thought it necessary to take into account that he was not born or raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging after Bitcoin.
Thus, he would have been in a worse position than others to learn complex rules that the tax authorities would not have established.
Thus, the man believed that his taxes for these two years would be redefined and pressured, but otherwise no punishment would be imposed.
Then he insisted that he work in Iceland and had paid taxes on this country since 2012.
He would never have done so in an ungodly way.
The charge of guilt would have been from the very beginning and would have put him in debt.
“ This man understands what football is ”
Andersen Willumsson has been prominent among the people's teeth, but has also aroused admiration for his progress for what's going on at the Pepsi Max.
The lights will be on the fire tonight when they meet IA in the direct broadcast at Station 2 Sport.
A brunette will then take out a ban because of four reminders during the season and thus will not be allowed to play with a new cut, as in the summer’s games.
He had written "blah, blah, blah" on his watch for the game at HK last Friday, which HK won 1–0.
“I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character then, he was rather trying in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants the ball every time, and if there was someone going to equal this game, I thought he would do it or make it," said Goddess Benedict's son at Pepsi Max's, when he was thought to be Brinjolf.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ Sometimes it’s hard to see where he is.
He looks a little out on the left when it comes to the game, but he has a very free roll on the team," Hjörvar Haflijas son said.
Törkel Máni Pétursson says that Brynjolf is really fun and is delighted to have such a colorful man in the department: “No one shares the fact that this is a character.
This is a fun type, and I love it with my hair, and always be ready to meet and answer interviews.
It's amazing that a lot of people are taken care of by him, telling me that this man understands what football is.
“I’m fun.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and I love it."
People are reading the interviews with Brynjolf, people are paying in and watching what is next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," Mani said.
Player KR says he wants to leave the company - "I've been in contact with a few people in the B department"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max Division, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media, Bold is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get to the beginning of his domestic period, but to that end he must first declare his agreements to the KR, where the Danish division begins before the Icelandic probability.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and have shown me a great deal of understanding," Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
“I have been in contact with a few people in the B section and will probably switch over before the end of the Icelandic period.
There are not many people in Denmark who can afford to pay up my contract with KR."
He then says that he must probably take on a wage reduction in Denmark.
“Friends in Denmark have probably felt more about the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Bjartmar’s bike has recovered for millions of bicycles — now answers for itself after DV
For a year or so, Bjartmar Leosson has had an interest in others.
He will rise up and deliver the lost one, and the stolen items, and the birds of heaven, and the ostrich.
Bjartmar has won the name of the biker for the week.
Last night, a number of times when you were talking to Bjartmar about your relationship with him, he said: “I’m sorry.
DV then pointed out in a discussion on the West Banking Facebook group, where Bjartmar found that the man had spoken on the East Wall and said that he might be surprised.
It was not possible to read the original writings of the electrician but that Bjartmar had stolen them.
These texts have now been changed to Facebook and the original DV news update has been predicted accordingly.
Bjartmar says that the original news of the case is not at all illustrative of what really happened yesterday in the East.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from a victim of a nuclear bomb that was indeed his nuclear bomb.
The information was received by the owner from others, but the information proved to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
“I saw the guy and I went through the shot, ending with information that there was a missing electric rocket that had been missing for a very long time and was looking for it.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him getting ready to drive off the trigger, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was certain of his fault, and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I do very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I had said, the man had taken away from me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter had just asked him to show him the receipt for the bike and had himself called the police.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."
So the owners of the power plant proved their ownership of their power plant and began to grow.
Later, the true owner of the electricity from his Facebook story, as described in the preceding article, said.
In this year’s bedtime Bjartmar says he can count the changes he has made to people’s fingers on one hand.
"I've had peaceful relations with the toughest men in Reykjaviker," Bjartmar said, pointing out that the bicycle driver is the longest of the least brothers and sisters of society, drug addicts, mind-blowing people and other people who are somewhere on the street.
"The drug is a hard host and somehow needs to finance the next dose, because unfortunately stealing such free trades is an easy way to achieve that," Bjartmar says.
“ My relationship with these people is really so good that I’ve brought a lot of good people with me.
There are examples of people going to treatment and taking and looking at me and helping me do what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmar’s communication with the riders of bicycles is at the mercy of the court.
Some know about him and what he is doing and offer to show him the receipts, the number of bicycles, and so forth.
Motor vehicle theft is a major problem that has little to say about.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police are more likely to tell people that they should talk to him with stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is unhappy with the first DV news transfer and is not said to be some self - centered police officer in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he has not yet arrived on the ice with his behaviour, and whether this is not the first and foremost role of the police, Bjartmar certainly says.
“ Of course, the police have to do this, but the fact is that the police are not doing this.
I've got to look up at cops driving away from a big pile of stolen wheels.
She's just saying no in these cases."
“When the police are not doing anything about it, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this group, why not?” Bjartmar asks.
He says he has achieved so much success in having stolen wheels, that he sometimes climbs on his “troublers ” on the street that they only have the brighter wheels they had before.
The changes that Bjartmar has called for help from the police have led to her having a clean conscience.
“It’s just not about the police, and it’s not about me teaching, and it’s not about the owners of the bikes to teach,” Bjartmar said, and it’s too bad that a victim’s biker needs to have an empty police in this category.
The success of Bjartmars is not shared.
In addition, stories can be found by people who thank Bertmar for having returned their property to them.
Bjartmar himself says that for a long time, he has lost the number of bicycles he has sent, but of course, the masses run at millions, if not at millions.
There is a heavy load of electricity, coal and coal, but coal can cost less than half a million.
Burtmar works at school every day, and every other weekend he works at a meeting.
Therefore, his ride is a reward for the work he does in his leisure activities.
Life Story and Long Shadows
In 2019 there were many birthdays in the history of life - threatening seas in Iceland.
Indeed, officials had been rewarded by the king of Dan all the streets since the 19th century, but in 1919 an official life - saving team was established.
Since the early 1970 ’ s, the basis for the present economic crisis of the general public was laid down by military alliances at the labour market, where it was welcomed for the employment crisis with a compulsory and complete collection of marine resources.
In 1974, laws were laid down on the basis of these agreements, and the life - threatening system continued to question them.
The wage system was not the only radical change that the 20th - century labor movement came up with.
Unemployment insurance had been similarly obtained in the historic labor camps in 1955, and the organizations had gradually come together to meet their demands for sickness and disease, severe weather, reduced working hours, improved household matters, and more as a matter of importance.
All these rights resulted in a great and intense struggle, but they proved to be a far greater and more lasting battle than the increase of the gold in the salary gap, which disappeared from the heat of the war - marked period until 1990 as many remember.
The attraction for the establishment of a global habitat in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although humans eventually came together to see that the seas were actually the property of seafaring companions, the team’s effort to ensure that their governments were organized by representatives of employees and seafaring companions alike.
In the following years after the establishment of the seas, the requirement for the majority of the workers in the sea administration was often discussed in the organizations of employees, but it never reached its end, so we still sit down with the abnormal order that the representatives of seamen are not in the majority of the sea.
Article 36 of Regulation No 129/1997 on the liability insurance of life insurance and the functioning of life insurance institutions refers to the financial policies of the seas.
According to the 1st issue, “life’s seas should have the advantage of being guided by marine society. ”
The 5th issue also states: “The Life - Giver’s Sea must set a moral example in financial matters. ”
In the Lifetime Trades Act, there are, inter alia, the following provisions, in the context of the abovementioned legislation:
The Sea of Life is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on financial liabilities, along with many of the largest marine and marine ecosystems in the Western world and in Europe.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good governance can contribute to the improvement of financial institutions.
This brings together the interests of financial stability and the goals of society in a broader sense.
LV considers it important that partners, especially those registered on the stock market, take a public policy approach: to maintain good governance in the social and environmental spheres.
The Sea of Life of Gildi, with its largest sea of the country, has set up a “responsibility policy, ” and there are similar rules.
This is all remembered here as an entry to the newest word of the Icelandic word, “shade control. ”
Since this is not the case, it is not the hope that it has been defined lightly, but I now see the following definition as “the most accepted ”: Shadow management is when a member of a community tells the media that he will send representatives of the community to the management of the habitat or order on how they should take a stand on a particular matter.
If they fail to comply, they will be removed from the government at first opportunity.
If the leader is not involved in this media and does not talk about reporting, however, it is not the “shade management” that ends such communication between people, of course, in the financial world as elsewhere.
I’ll let the reader think about the way he feels “smoother. ”
In particular, there are two people who have tried to accept this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday, 25 July 2020.
These are the Hörder Ogisson reporters in the Newspaper and Asgeir Jonsson, a bank official.
The occasion for both was that the Bodi Nils Bogason, the head of Icelandair, had said of his intention to sign the company’s agreements with airfarers and airmen (repeal them), and Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, president of the Company of Businessmen of Smokekjavík, issued them with the intention of the company’s representative in the management of the Lifetime businessmen to support the possible purchase of the sea on shares in the company, or they might be left out.
Some time later, the God of the Nile withdrew his decision, followed by Ragnar Thor, along with his purpose, which, of course, was in harmony with God’s decision.
Nevertheless, they saw the reason for speaking about the subject in the February issue of The Newspaper, with big words about shadow management, crime, and the need for laws to change.
Although the blessed typhoon would have been in contact and would have been soon wiped out, there was no doubt a small typhoon.
In view of the importance of the matter, let us consider the matter ourselves.
I've been here before for the pieces of the laws on life - threatening matters.
They include that the sailors should be careful about the welfare of sailors and have moral standards in financial matters, and these items are published in the agreement of both Gildis and the Life - Givers of the Trade Union, as I mentioned.
Lifeboats, however, should NOT be seen only for an hour of field missions in their finances.
This would be a dangerous course, and it would not be necessary to look for examples of such things in the past, since large bank and sea loans have led to immoral adventures and environmental shocks, with disastrous consequences.
Master Icelandair was obviously on ice when he thought of drying out a whole group of employees, thus greatly reducing the well - being that the company has enjoyed on the Icelandic market and weakening its position toward the financial parties.
Better off, he saw himself and pulled it back.
Time shows whether it is possible for society’s livelihood to be held accountable when it comes to shipping.

One of the infected did not conduct a home Bible study
One of the three reported by Covid-19 in the country yesterday came from the Republic of Austria on 15 July last, about one and a half weeks ago.
He is an Icelandic man who, however, is not a resident of the country and therefore did not receive clear instructions on how to carry out the so - called home affairs after coming to the country and going to another exhibition a few days after his arrival.
He got negative from viewing at the border.
"But he's in an Icelandic society and he's actually supposed to go into that conversation," says Kamilla Joseph's daughter, a specialist in the field of mining at Landläknik and the location of a mining technician while he's on summer leave, in consultation with the Newspaper today.
“He used the English form of registration and there is no need to record the teaching number and if pennital is not registered, you are not automatically announced in the latter view.”
She says that the man could have used the English script because he is actually a foreigner but because of his country of origin that an Icelandicman would have preferred to use.
However, he did not realize it.
“ When quinital is not registered, you need to look for yourself in the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
“ So it is clear that we need to raise the information about this while we find some way to do an automatic preaching system, even though the Icelandic do not record their teaching.
Or do it somehow more clearly who is involved in an Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
A better way to do so, however, is to get to the country, although it is defined as a participant in an Icelandic society that is becoming an Icelandic.
Only six were sent to the hospital after he was diagnosed yesterday, and those six were all in contact with him.
They should go to sampling, but two of them are going to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
On July 15, the man received a negative response from his demonstration at the border.
Kamilla probably said that he had recently been infected by the virus that he had not yet been able to discern when the vision was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to exclude the man from being infected here in Iceland but does not bring the virus to the country.
“ It is not quite possible to assume that this is certainly an infection because it is long since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here as these two who have had little control over sports events. ”
It says, however, that it is very unlikely because of the way the man got around here.
“It’s really very unlikely,” Kamilla says, but notes that it cannot be excluded until the Icelandic genetic analysis has been determined by the human virus.
"If we get a virus type that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost sure he brought it to the country."
Piper spray and explosives used against countermeasurers
There was an attack between the police and the protestors in Seattle last night.
Policemen used piper sprays and impermeable handguns, but countermeasurers broke pipes and turned on.
45 opposers were arrested, and 21 police officers were killed.
Police violence and racial prejudices were protested in the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were supported by Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protestant was killed.
According to BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
At Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set off for construction and broke into the city’s courthouse.
The police then said that the protests were unwarranted, and there was a conflict between the opposition and the police.
For justice in Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, 23 - year - old black man who was murdered by a police officer in August of last year was mentioned by opposers.
Car broke through a group of protestors in the city, but no one was killed.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the National Guard gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman murdered by a police officer in her home in March.
The group carried a gun and went to closed street meetings, where police separated the group from the group of people who objected and also carried a gun.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where opposers mentioned James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man who was murdered by white bartenders in May.
Sunset: Not the game that defines our time
Ole Gunnar Solskær, a member of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game at Leicester today in the final tour of the English Selection Department.
If the United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, end the Sunshine and his men in the 5th seat and then lose the Master's Department seat.
Still, they should hope to enter the Master’s Department by working for the European Department next month.
“We’re not just here.
If we get to the point against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad time now," Solskjör said.
"But whatever happens then is not the end of our journey, because we still have a lot in the country by getting the teams two ahead of us," Solskjör said.
Clearly, people’s nerves are getting thinner today at 15 p.m., but Sunshine tried to pretend that each other was playing.
“ If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being pressured in the last game of time.
It's nothing new, and it's based on that.
We have made a great opportunity to finish the period well and now it is ours to use it," Solskjör said.
“ It’s not the most important game of the period, it’s just the next one.
You can ask whoever's in the football, the next game is always the most important.
The results don't define our time, we've already had a lot of time to define this time range."
"Come Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I think we are in a better shape and will be stronger spiritually than in the last period," Solskjär said.
65,000 daily infections
65,490 new coronary infection was detected in the United States last night by John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the western sea since the beginning of the last decade in the country.
900 died of the virus yesterday, but the last four days until the virus killed more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000 on August 15th.
Fear of the Second Wave of the Age
The Spanish government is now trying to keep up with the increased prevalence of COVID-19 in the country.
The Spanish health authority reported more than 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Friday and Friday.
There have been no more reports in one day since the beginning of May and the news comes at the same time as the Spanish are starting to drop off one of the most difficult exits in Europe.
The backlog led to the fact that the British authorities now owe passengers from Spain to go on their way home.
A week earlier, Spain was on Britain’s list of safe countries.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in the northeastern part of Spain, where governments have taken more steps to try to stifle growth.
In Barcelona’s capital city, entertainment centers will be closed for the next two weeks and old houses will be closed at midnight.
There is now an exit ban for 200 thousand people in the Segria region of western Catalonia.
It is believed that Britain’s decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which depends heavily on the arrival of foreign travellers and is a bad game after the age.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel agency, canceled all planned flights to Spain and the Canary Islands today.
The world’s governments have been told to prepare themselves under the second wave of the tide, but little interest seems to be on the way back to the vast extent of the outback that has spread the fabric of destruction.
For example, Boris Johnson, president of Britain, has taken a very bad view of nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
At that time, Jean Castex, French President-in-Office, has said that the nation “will not be able to survive from, economically or socially”, if it is again caught up in a country ban.
Many local councillors are expected to be able to resume the virus in the next round if it comes to the inhabitants of a unique city, city, or region.
Five New Infections in Iceland - Three Inland
Three internal injuries were detected yesterday, plus two additional to the border.
Thus five people with positive Covid-19 infections were reported yesterday in Iceland.
The report of the public states that one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football event.
He had been sent to solitary confinement and sixteen who were in close association with him for 40 years.
The infected person was a member of a sports company in Reykjavík and is reported to be "only part of the sport" in the event.
Others who were sent there were otherwise related.
The origin of this infection is undetected and full-time abatement of the state police force.
ReyCup’s opponents have followed the advice and rules of the medical and public health profession that are still valid and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures of the convention last night showed that in a very close association, it was possible to celebrate the good conduct of its members outside the valley.
Just before 11 p.m. today, opposers published the following Facebook page.
It says: “ATH: Parents please respect the rules that competitors get their own stuff at school.
Parents are NOT authorized to do so.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday but related to the infection reported yesterday.
The report states: “Iceland genetic analysis has been consistent with the introduction of a new type of virus that has not been identified in the past. ”
In this case, it is also employed and is infected with isolation and 12 per capita because of the infection.
The third infection from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
It was discovered on the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close association with him for 40 years.
Two of them are already showing symptoms of viral infection.
In addition, two were detected at the border and further studies were expected to be performed, such as a program of infection at the border.
Finally, the report says: “The Department of Public Health and the Office of the National Police and the Department of Public Health ensures that people are careful and well - thought about individual infectious diseases.
The slightest doubt about the presence of the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus is the same as the request to go on a sample at the next health care facility.
The Patrex Feast says the tent area is well - known for its commercial health - direct visitors
The tent area at Patrexferd is completed every weekend, according to a West Bank report.
Guests are advised to consider other amenities.
Its names are Bildudal, Talmud, Melanes, in the Red Sea, Hotel Flókalund, and Hotel Breedavík as the second choice.
It is enough to be on Patrex this weekend, for as in the previous year, the festival of Icelandic authorship will be held in the city.
It has been held since 2007 and has thus become a strong city.
An application to judge the tent area may be expected at a good meeting this year, if the weather does not strike, but DV said earlier today about the outcome of prophecies.
However, the worst weather in the south may be expected, and there is hope for the Patrician.
The Web site bb.is first mentioned, and said that all other guests in the town were already completed.
The entire multi - story house caves in the best place in the city
Romanian workers live freely in Dunhaga 18-20.
While obtaining permission to renovate the building itself, their end has grown in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhoods in the city of Reykjavík, there are large multistory houses on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square feet [600 sq m] of commercial space.
Behind the house are doors of two steps, each holding four separate apartments.
They are between 93 and 130 ferrets, but most of them are over 100.
The house has a story to keep.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted video games, the School of Milk, the dairy shop, the Jóa gunpowder, the fishing shop, and now the latest Ha’skolapen.
The house has, so easy to say, its memory is a beautiful fiddle.
The house is now severely damaged, as can be seen in accompanying images.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
Owners of D18 are listed by company files, including Magnus Magnusson and the daughter of the God of Helga Laurus.
Magnus went to the mayor of Burgundy and was a defender of the Burgundy Society.
In the group owned by the owner of the company Borguna, Stálship ehf.
Steel ship is a financial company of the Holy Mother of God and her children.
Godrunn is also a third-party D18 head.
Her husband, Augustus, the son of Victory, and her husband, St.
D18 bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has had little to do with it since then.
The neighbors say that the house’s condition has steadily deteriorated since then, however, most in recent years.
On the Facebook page of the neighborhood, one resident says that the house was “not particularly lively last year. ”
There it can be played into the fact that the owners of a few years’ journey will be able to change the house and land.
Other neighbors say the house has long been out of order.
“It’s a long time to do something general about this card and it’s boring that this has turned out to be so. ”
He also says that he is full into the house’s owner because he has not been able to finish this, he finds a common plot with his neighbors, and he stops this “legislative button. ”
"Just do this in consultation with the community around so it's possible to go into this and finish it."
The "Political Key" that the holder refers to is the organizational process of the building which has been in progress at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were then authorized to build a height above the current multi-storey and behind the house, a new lift house, and the reconstruction of a single height, as well as the cellars.
The building permit granted for that operation was attached to the Environmental and Materials Committee and dropped it from a value where the operation was not to be classified as a sub-division, and the verification was not sufficient.
In July, they left the city with a divisional work, and it was announced in the July Governing Body.
The organisation was also closely involved and dropped it from its value in March 2020.
At this point, therefore, nearly three years after the initial application for building permits and the owner of the house at the start of the journey, the house was built.
At that time, the house had fallen down numerous times, and the neighbors became tired.
When DV asked the neighbors about the situation and the neighbors ’ reaction, they responded in a number of ways.
Some understood the intentions of the owner’s house, others not at all.
Others were angry at the city, not others.
Others were just angry, but nothing was really going on.
Still others said the parking lot, but the neighbors have new unused parking lot in Dunhaga 18-20 under their vehicle.
One complainant in this case said that the government was tired:
“ It’s amazing that we have to go through the three-way process.
It's like Reykjavik City couldn't read."
Today, the house is empty, abandoned, and abandoned.
A monument to the same government of the city and the generous plans of its owners and many years of work that is now under way.
When a reporter was wearing a garden in Dunhaga 18 the door and the trash were blown.
Playstation computers and new television were within another waste on the earth — a victim of an Icelandic summer blizzard.
It was opened in the old Háskolaprent’s office, where many of the cats of the bat were to be judged.
Clearly, someone has fixed himself in one corner, but no one is visible.
Several rows of beds and beds and a few leaves of earth’s pages, likely to become books, blew up.
The steps of the apartment were as open as life in both.
He was so happy to visit the people of another country.
There, the Romans sailed with potatoes for dinner and invited the journalist in.
The Romans work for the function of the Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and have defended DV’s authority that the company has paid nothing for the household except heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, it is not considered prudent to hire.
From the post office’s viewpoint, it is evident that there have been some number of foreign workers in recent times.
The recruitment of staff members has not been affected by the condition of Covid-19, but by a contract in travel which led to a contract in the building sector, and these two industries have been able to take advantage of the services of staff.
Even so, the residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do, and the workers and trademen in their land were forced to leave after a long day’s work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist praised the boys in Romania, he suddenly became clear: The best place in Reykjavík is a 1,500 - square - foot [1,500 sq m] estate.
Owners want to change the house to improve, and neighbors want to improve the situation, but share the definition of "bad".
The organizational area of the city is in the beginning, the victim of endless demand routes and the potential for love in the organization process and the similar solutions of the Committee on the Environment and the Environment.
So Roman workers live in the house, perhaps those who go to improve the situation, when the Icelandic stop fighting.

In an attack on weight due to the coronation virus cycle
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will contribute 10 million pounds to the campaign against overweight, which will, among other things, be banned from instantaneous announcements, after he is seriously affected, partly because of his weight.
In some cases, Johnson will learn about the campaign that has been promised better health in the morning, Monday, but in the course of the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bicycles for their patients in excess of their weight and will also be attacked with an increase in the number of bicycles.
The announcements will then be banned on television by 21 p.m., according to the British media.
"COVID-19 has raised us to the short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the President-in-Office is determined that we must use time to become healthier, more active and eat healthy food," said a spokesperson of the government.
Johnson himself has had trouble fighting, but he was put into custody when he was infected with the coronary virus in ours, and it's part of his weight because he's considered so seriously weak.
A woman better to lead the changes
She said that the new governing body would be the greatest step that the nation could take to achieve greater power, prosperity, and working against corruption and the welfare of the entire community.
“We need to move around a little bit now, and who is better able to lead such a change than the group of society that is easier to be in these terms.
There are women," Helga said.
“ Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s gatherings.
To stand together and make changes.
So now we've just come to lead these changes."
She said she was somewhat enthusiastic about the emphasis on Iceland, which is “best in the world ” in both gender and human rights.
“ Then we’re not as ready to see what we need to do.
Like the Germans, they are keenly aware of their history and consider everything they need to do.
It's a cave.
We need to know where we are coming from and where we know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of the affected groups.
We don't all live by the same rules," Helga said.
She said that she was a good woman in many ways in Iceland, but she added that, as elsewhere, Icelandics were built at enormous male value.
She said that politics was about self - control, authority, and power that were the forces that maintained injustice in all societies.
"Women have now set up this group and come together and have just become a little confused that Everything is going to move ahead with this 2012 national declaration," she said.
“ It’s these feminine values that we’re thinking about.
From human rights and nature, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same level," she said, adding that the above value was fundamental in the new governance file.
“We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change," Helga said.
“ It’s ridiculous that there’s some natural law that women’s jobs are always lower.
It's ridiculous that pilots and nurses have to be in an endless struggle just to get the human pay."

Trying to rob a wallwalker in the middle
A man was arrested in the middle of the night after threatening to walk on the street and trying to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in the Year, where two were arrested for the matter.
At that time, the police stopped a motorcycle driver in the Guards, where its driver was at a speed of 146 km at a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had been a type of driver.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn around at night, and about 80 cases were recorded in a police diary from five yesterday to five tomorrow.
At that time, there was a great deal of response.
On Saturday’s evenings, 11 loud reports were received, and it was reported in a newspaper to the police.
At night, however, 22 rumors were heard on the police station.
Six were stored in a prison cell last night.
In the Year, police were called to the night when the crew fired airfields.
However, they had already fled when a police officer was in a park.
At that time, nine drivers were stopped for computers and or drugs.
Four were arrested for beatings in the middle of the night, but one of them was kept in a prison cell.
Two of them were transferred to an emergency meeting after they fell on their face, one in the middle and the other in the West.
One was moved to an accident department after he hit the trampoline in Kopavoga.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who pulled a bicycle home in Kjalarnes yesterday.
According to the police newspaper, the bicycle equipment was in "very bad condition", and it was stopped.
You can stay in Monet's house about the health of the trader
The house that Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life is now available on the Airbnb page.
The next night's rest in the house is about the salesman's health.
The house is small and fragile, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The painter of the world lived in the house from 1883 until he died in 1926.
There are three bedrooms, two sitting rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his gardens famously in this house.
If someone intends to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb page, it is next released after a week, on Sunday of the salesman’s calendar, and therefore may be an opportunity for some traders to go to book the painter’s house.
The two nights above the merchant’s sanctuary cost only 964 U.S. dollars or just over 130 thousand Icelandic crowns as soon as the press arrives.
The symptoms of the disease caused by the coronation virus are evident in several of these cases.
Five have been identified with the domestic coronary virus in the last three days, and most of the infected are uninfected.
Because of this and some of them are beginning to show signs of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were detected by the domestic coronary virus yesterday and two at border inspection.
According to a specialist in the field, the increasing number of internal infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is expanding into society.
“ It has already been discussed since the previous internal survey, and there is a virus that has not been seen before, so we have no special reason to believe that it has been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something new to the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigrid Josephs daughter, a specialist in the field of welfare of an official country doctor.
Most of them have been infected with people who came from abroad.
More samples appear next than some who were in contact with those infected are showing signs of the coronary virus.
"Now there is no flu and no reduction in other respiratory infections, so we can be somewhat self-willed by doing this test on people who at the time of influenza had found reason to do something else first," Kamilla said.
It is mostly over, but it is not excluded that more have to go to bed.
The two infected were identified after a sports event.
Have you ever wondered if it would be prudent to hold such an event?
The director of public affairs says that it is easy for people to follow guidelines and rules.
Kamilla says that the infected were almost excluded from sports.
“ If there is no more isolation from these individuals after attending these sports events, we can assume that our audiences have been active.
But it is not found," Kamilla said.
The public sector is in constant review.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further recommendations or limitations if there seems to be a reason," Kamilla said.
After a week’s sleep, the number limit is reduced to a thousand.
This new location may affect the requirements.

Conflict between the police and the respondent in Seattle
Civil authorities in Seattle, Washington, have reported rebellion following numerous protests in the city.
Yesterday, police arrested a bomber and a piper to try to raid a large area that was subjected by opposers, and they crowded over many homes in the vicinity of the town’s capital.
The police reported on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that a study of the damage done at the police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb, was over.
According to the civil and police authorities, the respondent had robbed a police officer with stones, bottles, shells, and other loose ends and was transferred to a hospital where he was injured.
However, Seattle’s objections were peaceful for a long time.
The blast was used to show protestors in Portland, Oregon, but there has been a severe conflict in the city between the protestors and the armed groups of the national police.
There, like in other cities of the United States, people gather under the sign of Black Lives Matter, Georges Floyds, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protests systematic racism in American society and demands replacement.
Not revoked until after reconstitution
It is not yet clear whether their forecasts for the next month's Icelandair flight will be cancelled.
The Icelandic Air Force Air Force Air Force Air Force Air Force Air Force Air Force Air Force Air Force is finalizing at noon tomorrow.
Godly Linen John’s daughter - in - law, the president of the company, says that Icelandair will not make a decision on the statements until the results of the settlement.
"It's clearly hanging together," says the Diligor Linene.
“ There have been no resurgences, this must be settled so that the machines can be manned.
So, of course, people are anxious to know if there will be work after the meeting."
The contract was signed a week ago, on July 19th.
It is expected that it will be valid until the end of September 2025 and will be based on an agreement previously agreed upon.
On July 17, the government and the Icelandic Air Safety Board approved the announcement of a full - time military service at Icelandair, which was approved by its members in a settlement.
It never came to her, but it was determined by Icelandair’s decision to terminate the Air Safety Company, cancel all its flights, and look for contracts with another airline.
At that time, the company’s pilots were to take on board the safety team temporarily.
Asking how she feels that the settlement will go away will make it difficult for God’s Law to say so.
“People are injured after this operation of Icelandair, when all the airlines of the company were declared off and reported to be in contact with another airline.
Now it becomes clear whether it has any effect," she says.
At the end of April, 940 flights were operated by Icelandair, and 900 of them, by 95%, were cancelled.
Their feasting is corrupt, and their occupation corrupts them. He spends three months in the midst of the feast of July-August.
In that group, about 90% of Icelandair flights are available.
What does the agreement not mean?
“ Then we would like to have further discussions with our relatives.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he's refused, it's obvious that the flight beams have gone too far."
An assessment of the end of the crisis and Icelandair will report on another quarter of the year tomorrow
The air travel allowance for a new car accident will close at 12 a.m. tomorrow.
Set up Icelandair for another quarter of the year will also be published in the morning, but emergency relief results indicate that the company’s intakes have decreased by 85 percent since the same period last year.
The annual report of the Icelandic Air Safety Society and the Working Life Agreement for Icelandair began on Wednesday, 22 July, and closes on Monday, 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who can choose the contract are employees of Icelandair who pay the airline fee.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new agreement on Sunday’s 19 July business night, before Friday, Icelandair had concluded a meeting with the company after the first agreement was concluded at the beginning of July.
At that time, Icelandair had told all the flight tickets and flights of the company on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new charter was signed.
According to a new charter, flight tickets need to fly five hours more each month for the same basic salary.
The agreement is valid for 2025, but it has already agreed on the terms of the air traffic controller and the duration of the flight on one flight.
The agreement was known to FFI’s company at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and described many of the air travels that the news agency spoke about because of the agreement.
Most, however, seemed to agree that it would be necessary to accept the agreement to keep FI.
Set up Icelandair for another quarter of the year will be reported tomorrow with the company's EBIT, its rebate power for financial resources and taxes, according to emergency relief results negative to 100 to 110 million United States dollars or to some 15 billion Icelandic crowns.
Icelandair sent the Buyer an emergency check last Wednesday, stating that the company’s acquisitions amounted to about $60 million per quarter or about $8.3 billion.
Handbag money and its equivalent amounted to about 154 million U.S. dollars at the end of the quarter, about $21 billion.
Icelandair also aims to invite the company’s shareholding in August.
Icelandair is planning to conclude agreements with the fifteen sovereigns, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before entering into a partial bid.
New Deviation Rather than New Viraferon
“A new virus simply means that it has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been mutilated here internally," says Mār Kristianson, chief of the National Hospital Health Department, who said that the “new type of virus” was detected here in the country.
Three internal injuries were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One that was found to have been involved in the company’s sports show at the Rey Cup, but the origin of the infection is unknown and there is no trace of it.
An infection was also detected in a person who came to the country on July 15 and two who were in contact with him began to show the symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday’s infection related to the infection reported yesterday and after the order analysis of the Icelandic gene analysis was identified as “a new type of virus that has not been detected here before. ”
The scan is completed in relation to the infection.
We note that it is not a new virus, but it is the same virus and has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronary SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is more appropriate to talk about new strains of that virus than about new types of virus.
Asking what that means and whether it could say something about the beginning of another wave of old age, Mar says that, as is true of a single incident, it could happen so that nothing more will happen.
“However, if domestic cases that are not related to a foreign country and are of the same genetic nature as this particular derogation could lead to a conclusion [on a later scale], but it is urgent that such support be provided,” explains Mar.
Happy in the Name of the Pot
Is the secret to the happiness of the Icelandic people hidden in the hot pots?
Journalists of BBC therefore lead to a fun video that sheds light on the country’s sunscreen and hotspot culture.
Iceland’s bathing system is unique in the world, and it is claimed that no one in the world is as numerous as any in the world.
The natural earth’s heat is its base, but it also has a healing effect here.
Children’s education was legal in 1940, but older citizens are not able to use the hot water for health reasons.
It is described as a fixed part of the country’s general well - being.
In the pot, all are equal, regardless of position.
Without the phone calls, people talk about the home and the space or the use of the similar power of water: meditation and the loading of energy sources of souls and bodies.
To take a hundred days of the flag in the election
Hundreds of days remain until the United States elects and elects presidents for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a replacement, but he still has to get on the flag.
Joe Biden, the expected leader of the Democratic Group, has much advance in Trump on the ground, has been taken into consideration by the polls.
According to a recent AP survey, the United States estimates that the nation is on the wrong track.
Similarly, Trump’s global response to the new coronary virus is very unfavorable, and more Americans than before the president’s policy on economic matters.
Nearly two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent are said to support Trump’s response because of the age of age and 48 percent say he has maintained well-being in economic matters.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the mean FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9% in the country and Trump is 41.9% in the country.
Trump himself has tried to shift his attention from his behavior toward the elderly to Biden, to the so - called cultural divisions, and to give direction that should be governed by laws and regulations.
However, Biden’s proposal puts a lot of effort into keeping Trump’s attention focused and is highly likely to win if the election is actually about how Trump has been in work for the past four years.
It also seems that the unscrupulous Trump is going to come down to the citizens of the Republican Group and fear that the Democrats might even reach the majority of the United States’s elders, which has been very slow.
Politico said of the days that the followers of a class and a provider would be comparable, and it is now that the Republican Group would receive its greatest reward for the decade.
Environment has been particularly bad for the group in the 2016 elections and it is now expected that this development will continue.
Trump has tried in the past days to scare the inhabitants of the environment into following him, including by saying that he will become President of Biden, he will destroy the U.S. environment and promote racial divisions.
Among other things, Trump has dropped regulations from the time of Barack Obama in the White House, which was intended to increase the variety of environments.
Then he encouraged the U.S. environment to read articles from former Assistant Secretary of State in New York, as she believed that Biden would destroy the U.S. environment and took Trump under it.
“The prayer will destroy your disappearance and the American dream.
I will keep it, and even do it even better!" said the president.
The U.S. population is constantly growing in the number of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half all of the voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was reinstated in 2004, the bidder who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received most of the votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
The surveys have shown that despite the fact that Trump has secured a very large proportion of its outputs in 2016, its impact has been significantly reduced.
Although there is a difference between knowledge, Biden has been reported with about fifteen percent advances in Trump in the ex-antes.
Regis Philbin is dead
The U.S. television man Regis Philbin is dead, 88 years old.
Philbin worked as an actor, participant manager, acquaintance, and singer for about six decades.
He is one of the best known for managing the popular live chat shows! with Regis between 1988 and 2011 along with Kathie Lee Gifford and then Kelly Ripa.

Will the Olympics be lighted at the end of the march?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, an event that only world wars have been taking place to this end, the president of the National Olympics said that the Olympics would be "lighted at the end of the march", and pointed there hopefully in the world's chorona virus that the continent is now coming through.
Afrex people have year after year to prepare, and Japan’s authorities add to the cost of the delay.
All of us, however, have a lot to do with our heads.
When it was reported that Tokyo, Japan, would be surrounded by the Olympics this year, the joy of the Japanese delegates was unsatisfied.
They shed tears and laughter, which eventually led Tokyo to hold the 2016 games, but it turned into a lower hold for Rio in Brazil.
On this occasion, Tokyo and Japan were to take a bath in the world.
The games were scheduled to take place on July 24 to August 9, but they have been postponed for years and will begin on July 23, 2021, and will end on August 8, 2021.
If you fail to keep the games, if the crown virus is still too threatened, the game will be stopped.
Yet, no one wants to think about them.
Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.
Nothing is saved, the display should always be great and seek to top the last game.
The choice of a city for the Olympics is based on the evaluation of the city’s polls.
The greater the degree to which the doctrine is based — the more likely it is to be to receive the bribe.
Tokyo was worth $150 million in an effort to win the 2016 Olympics, or a total of nearly 20 billion crowns.
On the second occasion, when the 2020 games were held, $75 million, of $10 billion, were put in the press release.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo had won the game this year, the Japanese authorities had the same amount of $30 billion.
However, that amount is only a drop in the ocean according to what it costs to build an Olympic village, a playground, and in general to strengthen the country’s invitation to attend such a gathering, prepare it, and hold the games themselves.
Japan’s organizers have said that the Tokyo Olympics, who were supposed to be in the course of those days but who have been suspended for one year because of the crown virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report from a government official in Japan that came out at the end of the last year revealed that the cost was close to double the cost.
It may not be possible to fully evaluate the cost of delaying the game, but it has been estimated that it may cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.
Thus, the total cost of the Japanese Olympics and the Japanese taxpayers could run between $15 billion and $30 billion.
So high are the numbers that all the taxes of the Icelandic state amounted to only about half of the Olympics, according to the lowest possible cost.
Olympiacs are at the same rate that they have preferred to be a plethora of benefactors who try to steal numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
In short, many seem to have found that the impact of the Olympics is less than positive for the economy of the cities holding them.
Some, for example, have very little to do in the short term, but for a long time, cities tend to sit up with debt and fear - inspiring retirement costs for few people.
Ríó, Brazil, faces serious debts due to the 2016 games and has been struggling to support all the major sports activities that were built for the games.
According to the 2012 London Games, only 10 percent of those who received the Olympics were previously unemployed.
This means that there was no new job but a small one.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in maintaining the Olympics financially because of the bad cost of human activities.
The advantage, however, is to be seen in the increased travel of travelers who want to visit the Olympic cities in the wake of the games, which is still very uncertain about the 2021.
It is also unclear whether it is possible to accept all the audiences who usually attend the games.
The main issue, however, is the honor that cities deserve, but it is difficult to appreciate.
In spite of the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not the norm.
Of course, this is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes in the foreground.
To some people, it is surprising that it is just a matter of delaying the game.
For example, the Australian five - wheeled and gold - winning ocean, in its article on the last Olympics, Chloe Esposito, has been cassoletic and had been far away for some summers but is hoping to come in the form of a competition for 2021.
She is, therefore, among the athletes who are more content with the rest of the day for a reasonable reason.
For athletes who planned to stop after the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, meaning that in some cases they would stop the race before the games take place.
Simply do not rely on your body to go through years of hard work.
A few athletes were as numerous in the hearts of audiences at the 2016 Río Olympics as the Simone Biles film star.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has had some interviews in his country of America with the Olympics.
She's going to play 2021, but she's not really sure she'll be at the top of the next year, and she'll be 24 years old.
Although it is not generally considered to be older, it is much higher for a movie wife in particular.
"This is a sensitive matter," says Biles, but smiling at another interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympics, asked whether she was going to reach the 2021s as much as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll still be at the top after all year in addition to exercises," says Biles.
She has previously said that her body is no longer suffering from the stress associated with gymnastic training.
Nonetheless, she is a champion of the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that there was a feeling of the need to suddenly stop practicing when the world situation was at its peak and the movie hall was closed.
There were no exceptions to Biles more than others while all sports activities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympics could not afford any more access than others, she needed to find ways to stay in the same shape as others.
Surely, the basics are better than those of most people.
“We have a firm plan now.
It was difficult to start practicing again after the movie hall opened.
We started slowly, but we are back in the full - time ministry, and I will increase the number of exercises as well as year after year.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will become, or whether they will be held, but we do learn from the fact that they will be.
I've put too much on me to leave the sport now," says Biles.
Like other blind doubters, she may be more aware that the situation could lead to a 2021 not being held at all.
However, predicting it is hopeless.
No one can know how the global situation of the coronary virus will be in July 2021, and nothing else can be done but prepare for the Olympics as they will be held annually.
Maybe the Olympic will be lighted at the end of the Covid.
Late marriage due to old age
Modern Family playwright Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the crown virus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette's rival Wells Adams this summer.
"I think it's other important things to think about right now," the actor said in a conversation with People.
“ We finally want to get married sometime and have the dream wedding and have all those present who love us.
However, we decided to do so on time, focusing on what is now important and helping to share information about the importance of being in need and staying at home.
I'm looking at more global than weddings these days.
There's a lot going on and we should focus on what's going on in the world."
