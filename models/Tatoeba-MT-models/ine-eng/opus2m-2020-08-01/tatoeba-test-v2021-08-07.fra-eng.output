White pawn to f3, black pawn to e6, white pawn to g4, black lady to h4 - failure and mat! This is what we call in the circles of failures the "mut of madness".
The whites: turn on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. The blacks: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, crazy on b8. The whites put the opponent in zugzwang by playing the turn on a6, after which the blacks have only two options: take the turn on a6 or move their crazy towards any other case of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and offer failure and matt. In the second case, the whites take the black pawn on a7, with the same result.
