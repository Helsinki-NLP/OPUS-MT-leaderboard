Bosniaks protesting Croatia's plans for the storage of radioactive waste
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northern and western Bosnia in protest against the plans of neighbouring Croatia to store part of the only nuclear power plant in the region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known as natural beauty.
The demonstrators in the Bosnian town of Novi Grad asked Croatia to reject plans to build waste storage in former military barracks in the town of Trgovska Gora and declared war on the project.
The facility would contain waste from the Krska nuclear power plant.
The Bosnians, holding banners with the words "I want a healthy future" and "Stop – (river) Una needs us", said that the storage of radioactive waste can endanger the Union's rivers and the lives of about 250,000 inhabitants.
We don't have to say,
He told the crowd Miroslav Drljac, mayor of Novi City.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Union.
Located in Slovenia, Krsko power plant built in the 1980s.
Representatives of both countries will meet next week to discuss additional waste storage issues.
On Friday, the Croatian public television HRT announced that it had not yet been decided whether to build the waste storage system on its own or to pay for the storage of part of the waste in a new facility built by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister of Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told reporters that Croatia also has a problem with the use of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents on each side of the country of ethnic division insisted that Croatia find another location in part of the country near the power plant.
"Why does Croatia say that this is the best place in Bosnia in its entire area?" asked Drljac.
We can't let them down!

American Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 F-35
The Congress of the United States for 15 days after the approval by the State Department of the possible purchase by Poland of 32 F-35 multi-stakeholder fishermen did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The Congress decision, although not unexpected, has great political significance.
"After approval of the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I do not see any major obstacles," said John V. Venable, Senior Counsellor for the Defence Policy of the Washington, Conservation Tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that on the basis of the 1976 Arms Export Control Act, the federal government, represented by the State Department, must notify the Congress of any planned sale of arms abroad for 15 days before signing the contract if the value of such a transaction, in the case of sale of weapons to the NATO Member State, exceeds $50 million.
The value of the proposed purchase of 32 F-35 fishermen by Poland is estimated at 6.5 billion dollars. This amount includes technical and logistical assistance costs, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 - if this transaction is finally finalized - will be the American armed group Lockheed Martin and his subcontractor is the manufacturer of engines for the F-35A group of fishermen Pratt and Whitney.
The proposals for the purchase of American fishermen of the fifth generation F-35, on behalf of the Polish authorities, were submitted by Mariusz Blascjak, Minister of Defence, in May.
Poland's offer was discussed in June of this year at the meeting of President Andrzej Dudy with President Donald Trump in the White House.
If this agreement is completed, the representatives of the Pentagon will be held responsible for the implementation of the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programme.
As part of the FMS, Poland has already acquired Patriot Anti-racy system.
At the time of submission by Poland, the price of one F-35 fisherman was approximately $89.2 million without arms and technical assistance.
As the US military experts, who wanted to maintain anonymity, informed the PAP that the price given in the initial negotiations was "a maximum price far higher than the price to be negotiated".
"Prices are falling violently, currently the price of one F-35 is below 80 million dollars, much less than Eurofighter, which does not have the advantages of F-35," Venable said.
The PAP spokespersons expressed the hope that the final negotiations on the purchase of US warplanes by Poland will be over this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction, i.e. offset, will be directly discussed with US fishermen's F-35 producers.
What is the alternate team of Munich, which is referred to in the series "Payton Hobart Choices" on the Netflix platform?
Caregivers and parents with the abovementioned disorder show that their healthy child is sick.
The Payton Hobart series is on the Netflix platform today.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to be president of the United States of America, but first he has to be president of the academic self-government in his high school.
In Ryan Murphy's series, American Horror Story and Glee, we'll see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boyton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the series, he is moving on to the subject of the Münchhausen team – the mental illness of caregivers who perform as if the health of the person concerned had been affected by the physical or mental illness.
There are different types of this disease, such as the Munich team that is responsible for the symptoms of the disease.
The Münchhausen team is based on the simulation that the person remaining under our care has certain responsibilities.
It is also called a disease that is invented and caused, and it is treated as violence against the child.
This is a rare disorder that usually involves a parent who is experiencing symptoms or causing symptoms, so it seems that his child is sick.
What are the symptoms of the Münchhausen team?
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but NHS points to the following examples of behaviour:
Convinced medical staff that a child who looks healthy, however, feels bad.
Relieving or inventing symptoms.
Forfeiting results to make the child sick, e.g. to give glucose to urine samples to make it appear that the child has diabetes.
The onset of disease symptoms, e.g. by giving the children necessary medicines and other substances.
How often does the Münchhausen alternate team occur?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs because many cases of the disease are not reported.
The study published in 2000 shows that 89 cases of this disorder occurred in more than two years.
What should be done if there are suspicions that a child may be in danger?
Contact the local special services department or call the NSPCC child protection infoline by calling 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid on the school in Kadunia, evacuation of 300 children
Kaduna – The State Police Department in Kaduna carried out yesterday a raid on Imam Ahmad Bn Hambal's school, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma, Riga, Igabi's government area, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police claimed that the children were living under highly dehumanizing conditions, and the school authorities objected to this claim.
“ They don’t tell the truth because all the children were there for the parents ’ approval, ” said a school publisher named Sheu.
Before taking children to school, parents signed a form.
Parents brought their children daily food and knowledge of the conditions under which they were living.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of children, as well as by the removal of all the food of the students provided by the parents before the school was closed.
That's not right, because parents can testify that their children are under bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the previous Commissioner for the Abdurrahman Police, who once visited school to check the level of care for children, never had reservations.
He claimed that the children were studying the Koran and nothing else.
However, an expert at the Post Office of the Public Relations Police, Yakubu Sabo, believed that after the government was transferred to the state of the children, they would join their parents.
‘They shall be kept under dehumanising conditions in the name of submission or acquisition of root knowledge.
Many of them had twins on their backs, proving they were bitumen.
That's why we're studying school to get to know her owner," he added.

We can together create new concepts and new initiatives.
Rachel Rommeswinkel from the United States began her career as a blogger in Dongguan on the subject of torture and has over a million fans on Bilbili and Weibo.
She said she would continue to provide information on Chinese traditions, culture and technology in her films.
Leticia de Lassus from France, head of the JJB International Montessori AMI Centre in Guangzhou, agrees that “education of children is like a sport.
If you're wrong to turn on the first button, the rest will never get to their proper place.
The American of Chinese origin Henry Xiao believes that in the very centre of the GBA area, his company can enjoy many privileges with regard to new rules, government policies and capital resources, and in particular talents.
The cooker of the "Nanta Show" Sean Choi program in South Korea said that the Guangdong cuisine is known worldwide and the introduction of the "Nanta Show" program in Guangdong was a good decision.
Stephan Mohler from Switzerland, who works for the technical director of the Pearl River Pianos, believes that the secret of high quality is based on the proper performance of simple work.

Siemony: Tusk or Kidawa-Blonska will be president
"I think Donald Tusk and Malgorzat Kidawa-Blonsk have the chance to win the election with President Andrzej Dud," says Tomaz Seimonik.
Vice-Chairman of the Civic Platform Tomasz Siemoniak spoke with Polsat News about an affair with the head of NIK.
“This case is disparate for Marian Banasis.
It can be a minister of culture from some entertainment, not the head of NIC, or the minister of finance.
No one who is responsible for the billions, for the data," he said.
"This case is a very serious state crisis," he added.
Siemoniak also spoke about the candidate of Klaudi Jachira.
"Antoni Macierewicz is on the PiS list.
A man who didn't just say things, he just did them.
He judged the former heads of the SKW to spy on Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why doesn't anyone appeal that Antonie Macerevich be on the list?" he asked.
“People who are younger than us have different aesthetics.
I think Jachira, who has already apologized for one thing, also feels that sometimes she overrules.
Let's not deal with this campaign problem," he added.

"Obvious" masked child rapist from Central Coast forced to look at his victim in court
Dressed in a masked suit, a man caught a 12-year-old from the back and dragged her into a dense growth at Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to a tree and raped her.
Shortly after the arrest, a search warrant was carried out in his home, where officers held a number of important items for investigation.
The man admitted to guilt for seven charges related to the attack and three further concerning the perception and use of another girl, aged 11 years, between August 2016 and August 2017.
The 12-year-old victim walked in the path, and when she looked behind her, she saw how suddenly he had gone out of his arms with a great fork and a knife.
When she prayed "stop, stop, stop," she caught her neck and forced her into growth.
The man said: “Cheese, don’t cry.
Don't yell because I'm gonna have to hurt you."
Holding a knife in his right hand, he tied her hands and feet with cables and then tied her to a tree and raped her for almost an hour.
When he cut her off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man arrived at work about 9.30 without responding to a few text messages and calls from his colleagues.
His clothes were dirty and he was carrying traces of grass and wood, and he himself claimed to have taken part in the case of an angry attack on the road, during which he chased another driver in the bush and fell off his couch.
A further trial of the man's conviction will take place on Tuesday.
The Pope calls on the executive directors of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned the executive directors of technology companies, diplomats and financiers that, with the pursuit of artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievement, there is a risk of increasing social inequalities, if, in its course of ethics, common good is not taken into account.
Pope Francisk delivered these words at a Vatican conference attended by government envoys and representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics.
A small group of scholars and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This three-day event is the latest evidence that the Vatican is interested in participating in the debate on perspectives and threats related to artificial intelligence.
It discussed technological achievements in the field of war art and the future of work, which will increase the role of machines, as well as a study on the case of Christchurch murder in New Zealand and decisions taken by companies that own social media in connection with the spread of the film recording the massacre.
During his talk at the Pope's conference, Francisk praised the potential for technological progress, noting that the machines at the beginning of the industrial revolution saved workers from dangerous and monotonous work.
However, he warned that increasing dependence on robotic equipment to achieve gains is the risk of people being deprived of their dignity at work.
"If technological progress had become the cause of increasingly visible inequalities, it would not have been real and real progress," he warned.
If the so-called technological progress of mankind were to become an enemy of the common good, it would lead to an adverse impact on some kind of barbarism under the law of the strongest.
The conference organizers expressed the hope of using the expertise of the participants and identifying possible future advisors of the Catholic Church in high-tech matters.
Martin Odegaard, a professional loaned from Real Madrid, is making fans into his euphoria his effective assistant.
Martin Odegaard recorded an impressive assistant at the opening goal of Mikel Oyarzabal.
Winning 2:0 with Ossun, Real Madrit went to the top of La Liga table and continues to be an unbeatable pass in his own forest this year.
However, despite the fact that there is no defeat in this season in La Liga Zinedine Zidane, it is under tremendous pressure as a result of the stormy pre-season and public battle with the Valiant Star, Garethem Bale.
The situation reached the point where Real Madryt was humiliated in the League of Masters by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid, however, have real talents at their disposal – for some of them the French have plans, for others not.
Vinicius Junior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madrid and is currently playing in the team.
However, the Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard, who was loaned to the Real Society, caused a big move, counting the incredible assistant in the La Liga match.
At the meeting of the Real Sociedad with Alaves Martin Odegaard he performed an impressive assistant at the opening goal of Mikel Oyarzabal and the Real Sociedad finally won 3:0 before his own sight.
After taking the ball on the right, Martin Odegaard maneuvered the player from the opposite team, setting him a net, and then sent an amazing amount of money between the two other competitors and his team colleague just left to deliver his leg.
The second gate of Williana Jose and the third in the execution of the amazing Oyarzabal, this time from the crime scene, ensured a decisive victory for Imanola, before Manu Garcia was sent out of the box five minutes before the game ended.
Martin Odegaard joined Realu Madryt only as a 16-year-old in 2015, but he had difficulty trying to meet the expectations of fans.
Now, at the age of 20, the Norwegian baller finally seems to feel like he's in the woods.

Sharad Pawar denies the authorship of a criminal act and claims that he was in no way related to the bank, as well as points out the fact that the case was reported a few weeks before the October 21st elections in Maharashte.

What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysm, severe disease, child death.
It's dramas that cause a lot of suffering and it's hard to understand.
We're asking, "Why?"
Sometimes we also hear that "God did so".
Does the Creator send us misfortunes and diseases?

The king’s counselor, Judge Jeremy Richardson, said to the couple: “I will never be able to fully express how you have committed vile acts.
The crimes committed by you are talking about themselves.
The murder of two children.
Trying to kill four children and making a vow to save their lives.
I am practically convinced that every one of you will be sentenced to several sentences of life imprisonment at the right time."
This judge shall determine whether it will be a penalty for an absolute deprivation of liberty without the possibility of conditional release.

Ambassador PO Krzysztof Breyza by Caesar Gmyza
"As a result of the campaign of lies written on TV, I'm making an appeal against Caesar Gmyz," Po Krzysztof Brejz reported on Twitter.
The reason for the call is the statement by Cézar Gmyz's publicist in the program "Finally 20" on the TVP antenna.
One of the leading leaders of SokomzBuraka is Krzysztof Breyza, who has a lot of experience in organizing the hate division.
"People who know Marius Kozaka-Zagozda, the founder of the "heterski" profile, are Kierwinski, Budka and Gerithych," said Gmyz.
SokzBuraka are social pages and profiles with members and political jokes.
According to the "Networks", the P.R.S. Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda is behind the profile.
"We were able to find out that since April Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda has been employed in the Warsaw City Office, at the marketing office," he wrote a week.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police authority in connection with the close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The Independent Police Office of the IOPC shall examine the possibility of initiating an investigation with the prime minister explaining whether, during the administration of the public office as mayor of London, he was allowed to commit a criminal offence.
The Council of Great London (GLA) stated in a statement that its supervisory inspector had registered the Prime Minister's "question of procedure" in connection with allegations of preferential treatment of Arcuri resulting from their close knowledge.
"The question of the proceedings can be referred when information is presented indicating the possibility of committing a crime," he said.
That doesn't mean it's proven in some way.
IOPC is now considering whether it is necessary to examine this matter.
The issue is addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of police services in England and Wales.
She was transferred to this police oversight body because Johnson was then acting as the appropriate police and criminal commissioner.
Johnson denied that any irregularities had occurred because of his close relationship with Arcuri.
He said earlier that he was applying to the order of the London City Council and was giving details about his relationship with Arcuri, but he insisted that the Council "was looking at the wrong problem".
The order follows the report "The Sunday Times", that Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, received 126,000 pounds of budgetary money, and privileged access to three foreign trade missions, which became the head of mayor Johnson.
As a result of this report, the government has frozen a grant of £100,000 for the Hacker House Arcuri.
The government is awaiting difficult questions about the verification procedure carried out before the grant of the funds.
Minister of Digitization Matt Warman said in the Gmin Chamber that his department's employees "usually maintained proper care" and that the company had a British phone number.
However, according to numerous reports, the numbers were transferred to the California office, where the 34-year-old Arcuri is currently to live.
The close relationship between the prime minister and businesswoman "was a secret police officer's staff".
The GLA's decision to refer the case to the Prime Minister for the Independent Police Office of the IOPC met with dissatisfaction at 10 Downing Street.
According to a higher-ranking source, the government's representative constitutes a "politically motivated attack", and its term – before the Conference of the Conservative Party – is "clearly political".
"The Supervisory Inspector did not present any supporting evidence of the charge and the Prime Minister did not get a chance to respond to him before the press release late Friday evening," the source states.
Neither citizens nor the media can rely on such a clearly political law.
Today, in earlier hours, journalists “The Standard” were told that Johnson’s close relationship with businesswoman from California, who helped tourism and promotion agencies in London, was a “secret police” for workers.
The employees of the London & Partners (L&P) agency were built above and recalled that Arcuri was given a place during Johnson's foreign trade trips as mayor, despite the fact that her company was then not considered "reliable".
Third accused of drug offences in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – As a result of the previous year’s death of rapper Mac Miller, a third man was arrested and accused of committing drug crimes.
According to court documents, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling fake fentanyl-treated oxicodone pills that Miller had in his possession before his death in September last year as a result of accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, i.e. a strong opioid responsible for “epidemia”, which has absorbed several thousand human beings in the United States.
Walter is accused of delivering pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The court documents sealed on Tuesday reveal that Pettit received drugs from Walter all August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havas City, Arizona, is suspected of playing the role of Walter's "curier" who delivered pills to Pettit.
None of these men were directly accused of causing Miller's death, nor did any of them present any lines of defense in his case.
Walter, who has been subject to parole in the drug case since 2005, is in custody and has been further sentenced to five months in violation of the conditions of release.
The prosecutors concerned with the case, which they first brought to the attention of the TMZ's website on Thursday, demand that Walter remain in custody awaiting trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of the accused's escape.
The reply to the message left on the automatic secretary of his lawyer did not come immediately.
Pettit was sentenced to the Federal Court on 4 September, and his defendant refused to comment.
The word of Rome's works Miller is a sincere talk about his depression and drug use, so he got fans from the biggest hip-hop stars.
Coming from Pittsburgh Miller, who was really called Malcolm James Myers McCormick, for two years he left behind a song by Ariana Grande, who was finished earlier in 2018.
After his death in the Instagram portal, she published a moving movie with Miller and a song entitled "Think U Next", in which she mentioned him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been associated with opioid abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, a guitarist of the 3 Doors Down team, also died from overdose in 2016 and his body found the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone.
This Article is amended as follows: The correct spelling of Walter's name is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates over 30 games on mobile devices
A 9-year-old creates a game of fun in a hidden with free Scratch 2 programming application.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories in online or offline mode.
Like Basil has so far generated more than 30 games on mobile devices.
In today's game, there's a bat that's hiding in accordance with the program.
The player gets a point every time he catches a bat that gets out of the hideout.
I learned to play at an accelerated course.
"Now I create them when I'm bored," said Basil CNN.
In March, Dad wrote him on a five-day accelerated course for children from 5 to 15 years of age.
The course, organized by Codefest International, aimed at providing children such as Basil, access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, claims that Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
“When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always picked up the phone and played on it.
He played a lot in Candy Crush and Temple Run," said CNN's father.
But Basil's interest in creating games grew when he was 7 years old and he got a storm for spending all the time on games.
"One day he was playing on the tablet as usual, and he was so flattered that I got upset," said his father.
I said, "You keep playing, can't you think about creating your own games so that others can play?"
Speaking those words, I was upset and didn't think he'd take them seriously," he added.
Since then Basil has shown an active interest in the science of creating his own games, has attracted parents to the purchase laptop and has written it on a course during which he has learned the basics of creating games.
Basil, who in the future wants to be a scientist, gives his game titles based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available on Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes leadership in the area of continent innovation.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds have recently been praised for using codes to create robots that distribute their work at home.
In May the Acrobot team from the women's high school in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 competition for programming robots for stacking boxes.
And thanks to the growing investment of giants in technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and its peers are on the right track to the career of coding stars.
The former president of the Republican Party in North Carolina will admit to the corruption lie
From the documents submitted on Friday, it turns out that the president of the Republican Party in the North Carolina will admit that he lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of the main political donor.
According to Robin Hayes, he's going to admit himself to wine on Wednesday.
A document containing a factual basis prepared under the defence agreement signed by Lawyer Hayes shows that Hayes knew that he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defence agreement has been sealed, and there is no factual basis for Hayes' allegations.
He was initially charged with fraud, corruption, and false testimony.
The prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in the plan of the insurance company's data management company for the campaign to the head of the insurance market regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two partners were accused of trying to bribe the State Commissioner for Insurance, Mike Causey.
Lindberg is the founder of the insurance and investment firm, one of the major political donors in recent years, which has been handing over over $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He supported mainly the aims and policies of the Republican Party, but he also gave tribute to the Democrats.
His lawyer didn't respond to Friday's e-mail message with a comment request.
Defender Hayes Kearns Davis did not respond to Friday's e-mail request.
From the submissions made on Friday of the court documents, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he did not talk to Causey about the employees of the State Insurance Department.
According to the document containing Hayes' factual basis, he actually spoke to the insurance commissioner about making changes to staff employed by the market regulator.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg organize a meeting with Causey and that he was talking about catching directly with the regulator.
According to the April indictment, Lindberg required special treatment of his insurance business and planned to transfer up to $2 million to the new Causey campaign in 2020.
It follows from the complaint that the wording also includes the request for a change of the departmental officer who controlled Lindberg.
The future Republican of Causey has reportedly tried to corrupt federal agents and helped them to collect evidence of the case.
He wasn't charged with any charges.
According to Lindberg's indictment, he ordered Hayes to send $250,000 to Causey's campaign during a conversation that also included Lindberg and Causey.
During the conversation Hayes initially protested that the transfer of such a amount of money would draw attention, but as a result of the charge, he finally stopped.
“Whatever you all want to do, we will do” – Hayes said according to the indictment.
"Okay, I'll take care of it."
The Federal Prosecutor's Manual did not respond to an e-mail request for further information on the agreement.
Drivers will go with the first section of the new tomb
The drivers will be able to take advantage of the first of the three built mountain sections of the S7 Express Road, the new Zakopian – from the Rocky White to the Rabka Source and further the two-day main road to Chabówka.
As reported on Friday by the spokesman of the Krakow Department of National Roads and Highways Directorate (GDDKiA) Ivan Mikrut, this is the first of the three sections built S7 south of Krakow, from Lubnia to Rabki Source, which will be dedicated to use.
From more than six kilometers from the Rocky White to Chabówka more than one third, i.e. approx.
2.3 km, she's been taken to high school.
There were seventeen of them, including the longest and highest, counting miles of length and 50 m of height, and four small objects on the river near the Skomielna.
This link led to departures in Wadowice and New Court, to National Road No. 28 and to the old DK7.
From the next link, Zabornia, you can go to DK47 towards New Trade and buried and to DK7 to the Czech Republic and the border with Slovakia.
On the Zbijek Mountains, the services of the MOPs were provided.
The express route ends with the Zabornija Zabornija in Rabce Source, which was built about a kilometer of a two-day fragment DK47 to Chabówka and is included there in the already existing two-day Chabówka – Rdzawka.
The section S7 Skomeilna Biała – Radka Srój and the new section of the national road No. 47 of the main accelerated class (GP) from Rabki Srój to Chabówki was built by Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The investment cost was about 615 million zł.
The quality assurance of the work carried out will be valid for 10 years.
Counting approx. 16.7 km of new piece of Zakopianki, including 15.8 km of expressway parameters, was divided into three realization sections, each with a personal performer: Lubijn – Repair, Repair – Skomielna Biała and Skomielna Biała – Rabka Zrój.
The first section to enter the tunnel is carried out by Poland – the Ukrainian consortium of companies: IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and the ALTIS-HOLDING Corporation from Kiev, the tunnel section – the Italian company Astaldi, and the third – the Italian company Salini.
The total cost of these tasks is close to €2.5 billion.
The investment is co-financed by the European Union Funds under the Operational Infrastructure and Environment Programme 2014-2020.
The amount of funding is more than $1.3 billion.
The entire section consists of a total of 38 engineering facilities (bridges, valds, stacads) and a two-room tunnel with a length of 2.06 km.
According to the plan, the road manager will still be available this year, 7.6 km from Lubien – Repair with temporary integration into the old DK7, which drivers will limit the construction of the tunnel.
The last section, Repair – Skomielna White with a length of about 3 km, drivers will leave in 2021, after completion of a two-room tunnel with a length of about 2,06 km.
Our goal is the state of well-being
"We are building a welfare state in Poland," said Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro.
He came to Szczecin to vote on the councilman Darius Matecki, who was a candidate for the Sejm from the list of rights and justice.
"The programme of good change is the implementation of the Polish welfare strategy," the Minister said.
“We want the Poles to make a lot better for their lives to be at a higher level.
This is necessary because otherwise young, dynamic, well-educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford it.
Our government has consistently carried out a programme for four years ago.
We said we'd put in a 500 plus program.
The platform, Donald Tusk and Eva Kopcz said it's impossible that this money just doesn't exist.
We proved that the money was and was, but PO didn't care about those they were dealing with."
Ziobro also reminded of the children's driver and the thirteenth retirement – and that the fourteenth retirement is planned.
In addition to the 'dissolved division of national income' of PiS, it is a just state and economic development.
Money should not only be a large stream to the pockets of selected people who have good relations with the establishment and authority, but should be a balanced one for the entire society – he said.
Emmanuel Macron is holding hands to Jacques Chirac
French President Emmanuel Macron congratulated his predecessor Jacques Chirac on Thursday's television performance; he called him a great French and a great husband.

And whether we shared his ideals, his battles, or not, we all recognized each other in this man.
Tonight is a night of gratitude for Jacques Chirac.
He did so much for the nation, for our values, brotherhood and tolerance," Macron continued.
He recalled that in 2003 Chirac opposed war with Iraq, which had no UN mandate, ran for peace in the Balkans, for stabilization and peace in Lebanon.
Before the television show, Macron arrived at the Paris Chirac apartment on de Tournon Street.

Part of Sopocky Street in Niska already after construction
On Tuesday, 24 September, the Sopock Street was officially opened in Nisko.
The total value of this task was 803 thousand gold, of which 26,000 gold was FDS funding, while the remaining amount was its own contribution from the Netherlands and the Municipality and the City of Low.
Thanks to the measures obtained, it was possible to carry out, inter alia, a surface length of 1284 metres along with its extension, a corridor of 950 metres, drainage and finishing work.
The investment operator was the consortium of companies: PBI Infrastructure S.A. Z Krasnik and PBI WMB Sp. z o.o. of Sandojerka.

Facebook's concern about user self-esteem is hidden for a sample of favorites
As part of the first experience in the world, which aims to improve user self-esteem, some people using Facebook will soon not see the number of favorites, reactions and video displays.
The favourites will be hidden and visible only for the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia as a result of a similar test carried out on Instagram in July.
The new Facebook version launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, director of Facebook Privacy in Australia, said that the change is the result of a self-esteem study and opinions of mental health professionals indicating that the number of favorites may tend to compare with others.
"The clothes of our collaborators were really positive," said Garlick.
The elimination of this numerator will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of content, not on the number of favorites or reactions.
It is expected that sharing with others through the platform will be more enjoyable and will not be accepted as rivalisation – she said.
Garlick has ensured that companies that are based on Facebook will still receive the same indicators and observations that they have already had access to.
She said it was too early to be able to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as was the case with Instagram when the test covered Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment will end and whether the change will be made on a permanent basis.
"Introductory user comments on the new rules on Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to opinions," she said.
Speaking on the site of the world experiment, Garlick said that Australia has very active, technically well-known Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an incredible country that will provide us with valuable opinions indicating whether the new experience is valuable for those who use our services or not.
Common: Counsellors want compensation for pilgrims
It is often not commenting on the Council's appeal to the Abpa Wacława Depo for financial compensation for the disposal of the waste in the pilgrim season.
The city applies for 1 zł from the Pilgrim.
On Friday, he spoke at a press conference with the leader of the Spring Robert Biedron, organized on the leading side of the Clear Mount of Commons but of the Most Holy Mary Miss, the vice president of the council of that city and candidate for Sejm Lukasz Kot.
As he informed that the day before, the SLD council had voted in favour of the appeal to Abpa Wacław Depo for the transfer of one gold city from each visiting Pilgrim’s frequent pilgrimage – in support of the work of city services, municipal services, etc.
We accepted an appeal from Archbishop Depo to help the city, help us clean up the pilgrims, find the town for the pilgrims.
"We ask to transfer the symbolic gold to the city's budget from every pilgrim.
This city will provide them with better living conditions in Frestochova," said the Vice-President of the City Council.
Asked for a comment by the spokesperson for the metropolitan area of St. Mariusz Bakalarz who originally prepared a few questions, he then asked – as he suggested – to replace it with information on the content: “We do not refer to the matter until we have received the official position of the city council.”
According to a project on the website of the ‘Abbreviation of Financial Remuneration for the City of Frequent for the Management of Municipal Wastes during the Pilgrim Season’, the ‘Abbreviation of Financial Remuneration for the City of Frequently for the Management of the Municipal Wastes’.
"Because of the increasing number of pilgrims arriving in the Common Pilgrims and thus increasing the cost of the management system of municipal waste during the pilgrimage season, taking into account the city's views among residents and residents, birds and birds, we want to offer participation in the cost of handling the waste system in general, as part of the accepted canons of care for our common good, the small country of the Commons, to be participation in the service of the waste system," it says.
"In order to maintain the purity of pedestrian tracks moving at the same time as pilgrims using small infrastructure, i.e. external waste, we present a proposal for symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of 1 zł from Pilgrim," wrote.
"In addition to the participation in annual costs that the city will cover from its own resources, taking into account the purity and aesthetics of urban space, and in order to stress that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the amounts will be allocated to improve tourist infrastructure, for example by increasing the number of public toilets available," the Council said.
They pointed out that, in addition to financial issues, their proposal is based on a number of reservations made by the residents regarding the state of the clean road that the pilgrims are moving.
"In view of the purity of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the Council of the City of Frequently appeals to the Archbishop of the Wacława Depo for financial compensation for the town of Frequently for the operation of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season," repeated in the appeal.
According to information from the Press Office, 834 thousand people attended the sanctuary in 200 Polish pilgrims throughout the year.
About 124,000 faithful people arrived in 255 pilgrims.
More than 8.8 thousand people arrived at the Frestochus in cycling pilgrims (133 groups) and 440 (16 groups) in running pilgrims.
A total of 20 people arrived at the sanctuary on the horse, and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups were on the reels.
"News" TVP mentioned the Confederation when describing the survey
According to a pollster survey, in the elections to the PiS Fair, 45% would vote, CO 26%, Levica 14%, PSL 7%, and the Confederation 5%.
The passage of the electoral threshold was even written on the “Super Express” portal for which the probe was conducted.
In the main edition of the “Notice”, describing the same survey, the results were presented only to the first four parties, completely ignoring the Confederation.
The leader, Edita Lewandowski, made it clear that only four committees had exceeded the electoral threshold and would enter the Sejm.
The TVP also showed the division of parliamentary mandates without taking into account the votes given to the Confederation.
It would give PiS self-government.
In commenting on this whole situation, Christof Bosak spoke of "public compromise in the matter of honesty towards society".
"They began with the password "moral revolution", he recalled and said that this case was a sign of weakness.
In turn, Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that "TvP News" in subsequent actions against the Confederation are insulting Urban and Miknik".
He also drew attention to the lack of legal feedback from journalists.
"But let us also look at those who allow silence.
Those 'right', 'independent', 'insubordinate'.
In a few years they became a more primitive version of all that they fought at night," he added.

Brother sentenced to life imprisonment for killing the honorary stars of the social media Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star thanks to the photo published in social services, was drowned in July 2016.
The brother of the Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was recognized as guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment for the most famous "honored murder" in this patriarchal country.
Baloch, who gained fame by publishing bold selfies – Greek according to Western standards, but in a powerfully misogynistic Pakistan considered to be provocative – was suppressed in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, during a press conference, he said that he had no doubts about his actions and stated that he had "of course" murdered his sister and that her behaviour was "inacceptable".
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood handed down AFP that the court in the western city of Multan considered his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-awaited sentence.
"Inshalah (if God permits), will be executed by a higher court," he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, announced to the AFP that she hoped her son would be executed.
"He's innocent.
She was my daughter, and she was my son," she said.
Baloch's murder hit the heads of global information services and renewed its call for action against the so-called honour killings in which victims, usually women, are killed for breaking the patriarchal social rules.
Women were burned, suffocated, shot or stylized for sins such as choosing their own husband or, as in the case of Baloch, for bringing their family "glorious" through manifestation of their own sexuality.
The murders are usually committed by a close bloodthirsty.
According to Pakistani law, Qisas (blood money) and Diet (rebate) can ask for forgiveness for the nearest victims.
Three months after the assassination of Baloch, Parliament adopted a new legislation introducing a life sentence for honorary killings.
However, whether the murder will be considered an honorary offence remains in the judge's hands, which means that murderers can theoretically rely on another motive and be acquitted.
In the case of Baloch, her parents initially urged that their son be shown no mercy.
However, they feel that they can also lose him, change their mind, and claim that they want his innocence.
The international outrage caused by the murder has led the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and to announce itself as a loser with their parents, thus forcing the move forward.
One of Baloch's most famous works is to offer to strip off the Pakistani cricket team and set up a decoupled purple dress in Valentine's Day.
It was criticized and threatened, but many, including young people, viewed it as a cross-border restriction in a country in which the attitude of Kim Kardashian can be seen as a bold and political movement to strengthen the position of women.
The roots of "honor" killings are in tribal social norms, which still dominate South Asia, and in particular regulate the behaviour of women, although men may also be victims.

Anarchia doubles the number of residents from north-west Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations reported that increasing violence has resulted in a doubling of the number of persons displaced from north-west Nigeria in the last four months to some 40,000 people.
The United Nations Refugee Agency has stated that concerns have created "a new exceptional humanitarian situation", which requires an inter-agency effort to gather new funds by the end of the year of 35.5 million dollars.
Babar Baloch, spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic group of Boko Haram, which has been leading the rise in the north of the country for decades, is not responsible for the last attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfar and Katsina, observed over the past 10 months, is rather the result of the activities of organised armed groups.
"It paints a frightening picture of anarchy and uncertainty," he told reporters on Friday.
He reported on frequent reports of kidnappings, tortures, forced executions, murders and sexual assaults on the grounds of attackers, who also destroy homes and stolen profits.
The military and police were sent to fight gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the army is withdrawn from the fight against Boko Haram and the expulsion of the Islamic State in West Africa, which separated itself from its former grouping in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with group names," he said.
They're coming for it with the beastly stories.
In most cases, refugees return to neighboring Nigra.
In his statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, he said he hoped that more people would join Nigra in the coming months, along with the worsening security situation, in particular in the state of Sokoto.
A new date for the trial of the male accused of the murder of a woman and two children is set
A new date is scheduled for the trial for a man from Guatemala accused of killing the state of Iowa and her two children.
According to the Act of the District Court of Polk, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellan is charged with three first-degree murders, according to the authorities, with a false name that he originally gave to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't confess.
According to the police, he shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and her 5-year-old son at their home in Des Moines on July 16.
It follows from the caselaw that the new date of the proceedings, i.e. on 27 January, gives the representatives of both sides more time to prepare.
Immigrant and Customs Service officers claim that Escobar-Orellana is illegally staying in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was sentenced to an illegal entry into the United States.
"The Sun": Boris Johnson in the face of a cabinet's rebellion to reduce requests for Brexit and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Within just three weeks of the final summit of EU leaders among the most important people in the Prime Minister's environment, there is a growing concern that he will not have enough time to obtain more important paragraphs.
Boris Johnson is facing the risk of a protest by a cabinet that wants to reduce requests for Brexit and to reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
In the negotiations there was an impasse on the new customs system which would replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, since Brussels has defined the proposals for other provisions offered by Johnson as "inefficient".
The Crown ministers expect EU decision-makers, headed by German chief Angela Merkel, to offer them a compromise in the form of a three-year deadline for the backstop mechanism in the last moment.
Journalists "The Sun" spoke with three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the Prime Minister after the annual tour conference next week in Manchester.
They will demand the Prime Minister to reject the "aggressive" strategy developed by his close advisor Dominique Cummings, which is based on attempts to use bluff against the EU and the threat of leaving the Union without an agreement and then accept offers made by the Union at the last moment.
One of the cabinet ministers identified the jury's verdict of the Supreme Court on Tuesday on the termination of Parliament's suspension as a "warning signal" and added: "The only way for us to leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of the agreement.
We'll never beat the arithmetics in the Gmin Hall, which works for our disadvantage.
The Prime Minister must now take action and accept what he is able to get.
Aggressiveness doesn't pay: it's obvious that Cummings' plan was on fire.
We can't fight on so many fronts.
The second cabinet minister has committed himself to hand over to Johnson to try to break the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresy May, if it doesn't say anything else.
He said: "If I have to tell the Prime Minister to re-present the agreement proposed by Theresa May in the Gmin Chamber."
There are numerous opportunities for her vote, and everything depends on the end of this topic.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking negotiations seriously.
In his late speech, the Prime Minister of Tourism said: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
But we don't see him sitting in Brussels and working on it.
Instead, he's working with bullies in Scotland, he's testing the eggs in Wales and he's fighting with citizens on the main streets of cities – everything in the world's eyes, as if there's already been an election campaign for good."
Yesterday's Prime Minister's spokesman admitted that the agreement is still far away and added: "No one should be misled: a very long way to get an agreement."
However, the speaker also said that the Benna Act implementing the postponement of the Brexit by three months in the absence of an agreement "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: "There is no doubt that this law makes negotiations difficult for us, but despite it, the prime minister and his staff are still trying to make progress due to hard work."
The Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where he will have more talks with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss a book on how to operate the area for all of Ireland for food and living.
A dog with no nose and no leg under Instagram.
Perfectly imperfect
Kundelek was supposed to be asleep.
However, it was possible to prevent this.
The bitch was transferred from Romania to the United Kingdom by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The photo of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort has fallen in love with the animal since her first look.
"At first I had difficulty convincing my husband to adopt because we already had three dogs," she said.
The woman decided she'd take care of the bitch until someone didn't take her.
However, no one has yet reported.
“The fact that no one wanted her made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate said.
Eventually, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her the way she is, and if anyone doesn't like her, it's her problem, not ours," said the woman.
Bonnie became a social media star over time.
In Instagram, over 14,000 netizens are watching it.
Lorraine Kelly: It's said that with a glass accent I'll never make a career on TV
According to Lorraine Kelly, TV leaders said that because of the highlight of Glasgow, "he will never make a career" as a presenter.
Recalling her 35-year career in the television industry Kelly, in 59, admitted that before her first performance on the screen, she felt “great nervousness”.
"I was only 25 years old and was very nervous," she said.
When I worked in BBC Scotland as a intelligence expert, the chief of staff said that my accent on Glasgow would never lead to success on television.
I went to London to meet the entire TV team and watch the show before I took on office duties in Glasgow.
I'll never forget the interview with the star Bette Davis conducted by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a Scottish TV correspondent in 1984, she began her career as a reporter for the local newspaper in East Kibride in Scotland.
She then started running programs such as GMTV, ITV Breakfast and Daybreak, to later start with her early Lorraine program, which she took on her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career is a special program that will remind her of her best-remembered moments and experiences.
The presenter said that the secret of her long train on television is "passage and enthusiasm" and "an interest", adding: "It is difficult to work.
To be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programmes and be both interested and interested.
When she recalls the media reports that affected her emotions, Kelly says that it was "very difficult" for her to relax her murder in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families of murdered or wounded children were watching our program live from Dunblane the day after the terrible killing of sixty children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me to have a private meeting, during which we talked at her house for hours.
The whole meeting was quiet, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral.
She added that "very difficult" was an interview with Kate and Gerry McCanna shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that "they really admire their strength and courage".
They have to deal with the pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and they also have the most horrible Internet trolls.
I'm with them with all my heart.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on television will start at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30 at ITV.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of imprisonment
The senior state official claimed that Vice-President Constantino Chiweng rejected the proposal to take over the president's office made by the surviving president of Robert Mugabe at the top of the coup because he was afraid of imprisonment in order to confirm the taking over of the military in November 2017.
As last week, Mugabe offered the Vice-President Chiwänze the presidency during negotiations with the military during the turnover.
However, a senior state official announced in the social media that Chiwenga did not reject the offers of fear, but because he reviewed the Mugabe plan, which was intended to use it to prove to the world leaders and the African Union (AU) that he had actually lost during the coup.
On the Twitter portal, which confirmed that a 37-year-old Zimbabwean ruler wanted to hand over the authority to Vice-President Chiwandz, not to President Emmerson Mnangagwi, Jamwanda 2, to which officials confirmed to the state that he was a senior state official in the Bureau of the President and Council of Ministers, it was said that there were intense negotiations on this issue at that time.
Officials of the State claimed that Mugabe contacted Chiweng through one of his envoys when he realized that his authority was depriving him of it.
The mediation between the military authorities and the former president was three stages, according to a senior state official.
The official claimed that among the participants of the negotiations, he was the spokesperson for President George Charamba, then acting as Chief of the Central Intelligence Organization of Aaron Nheper and the spiritual representative of the Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The former bank manager of Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, has been another element since Mugabe sent him with a one-person mission to hand over the offer to the President of Chiwänze, who was head of the Zimbabwe Defence Force (SOZ).
A man who died more than ever before was considered to be an icon of Africa, tried to get rid of the U.S. army by trying to lure other African leaders into action.
The President's offer, made by the then late Mugabe Chief of Defence (SSO) Chiwand, did not result from the election.
"It was a desperate act to save the situation that took a dangerously fast pace, removing part of the deceased's family," wrote the official (Jamwanda).
But there was also some political temptation that helped the dead to reverse the situation in a completely non-democratic way.
It is enough to recall that the commanders have declared that they did not cover nor cover constitutional order, which would lead to their conflict with the position of the UA on conversion.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chivenga) would be brought to an end, violently interrupting the leaders' claim that they did not circumvent the constitutional order.
The hope for the dead (Mugabe) was that the UA, which, on the margin, was still highly distracted by the whole situation and the way it was fit into its theoretical taxonomy of conversions, would then have no choice but to describe it as a conversion, which would therefore be credible to call for military intervention.
It was in such a spirit that the offer was made and with such a measure.
Officials claimed that Mugabe had made this move when he realized that the defence forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign a resignation letter after warning the wetman that he was risking a Caddafi-style belt.
The military chiefs told him they wouldn't take a shot at citizens if they moved to his residence, Blue Roof.
And at the same time Mugabe had two wishes, namely to save his family and prove that the army had taken over," the officer added.
The current SSO and the commanders read the statements correctly.
The messenger (Gono) who conveys this desperate message is given an understanding – through a powerful metaphor – that the isa tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (which belongs to the Camouflage sect, i.e. the military), we are not politicians or we are not competing with each other at political level, the state official claimed a higher rank.
Officials tell the State that the military informed military commanders in the region through the attacks that they were in Zimbabwe that they did not intend to cover Mugabe, but to deal with its "criminalists".
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to try Minangagwa again from the short exile in the South African Republic to talk about conversion and success.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought assistance in the region.
The inhabitants of the South African Republic, which is a key element of the process – not only because of their economic and regional strength, but also because the then President Jacob Zuma was President Sadc – refused the intervention, but clearly indicated that if the army finds the house of Mugabe, as it has often feared in the background, the forces of the South African Republic will appear immediately in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and African leaders didn't choose this route," said "the Independent."
China needs strong leadership or will "break up" as the policy document states
The Chinese need a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, because otherwise the country will "fall apart" – the government said in a document on the policy issued on Friday during the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic.
The Chinese government's press office reported in the White Paper that the country's success since the Communists took over 70 years ago led the party.
The Chinese occupy large areas, have complex national conditions, while the administrative difficulties are rarely seen here.
The document recalls that without the uniform and strong leadership of China, they will move towards division and division, which will be disastrous for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long been using hard-armed policy to solve the problems, as in the case of force of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the country's stability.
President Xi Jinping's strong hand, who will lead the world economy's second-year trades on Tuesday, from the time the office was taken over by the end of 2012, has further narrowed the party's governments and imposed sanctions on those who can question the authorities.
Xi is also overseeing the military modernisation programme that has taken this region out of balance.
The document stated that China did not attempt to export its development model or want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace, not hegemony.
The Chinese do not have in the genes of subjugation of other nations or domination of the world.
In modern times China has been oppressed by great power, and wars and troubles have left a deep impression on them as a result of the suffering they have experienced; China will never cause any other suffering they have experienced.
China is attending this anniversary in uncertain times for the country involved in the bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to the liberation of the economy, as well as anti-government protests in Hong Kong.
The document says that China never "trades" its most important interests or allows anything to undermine their sovereignty.
As regards the country's trade dispute with Washington, the document states that "the risk of trade wars and the continued increase in customs tariffs do not lead to problems".
China has grown up with a full industrial system, a complete industry chain, a large market place and a strong pace of economic development.
The document adds that "war trade will never weaken it".
The Chinese are certain that they are able to face difficulties, the crisis to turn into new opportunities and open up a new world.
It has also been added that the United States should take a rational look at China's development because China does not intend to question the position of the United States, nor does it want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even less likely that they will stop the development of China.
Restricting and weakening other countries and transmitting national disputes abroad will not provide the United States with a strong position.
World Jack Palkiewicz: Dubai, real faces
The Dubain emirate is still a place of searching for its own identity, divided between the Bedouin tradition, religious radicalism of Islam and extremism of progressiveness.
This new trend of world tourism leader awakens imagination and desires, easing the emptyness of rich snobistic hotels and attracting searching fortunes for investors and traders with the status of a tax paradise.
Internet sites infect with enthusiasm for this city of dreams, which is an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated 21st century architecture in one.
On the rich island of sand, the emirates became Eden for those who love the rest, five star hotels, beautiful weather and swimming pools hundreds of meters above the earth.
Many are fascinated by the universal pride, the appreciation of creative hyperactivism and the hysterical pursuit of avant-garde.
This is the city whose motto says everything: "to surprise, to shock and to enchant".
And it's almost every step of the way.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling them a city without character.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the full limits and contradictions of the metropolis took the size of the tandem grotesque. ”
It turned into a futuristic nightmare, totally dominated by the Guinness Book of Records, an informal emigration constitution.
Because everything here has to be bigger and more beautiful than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is something lacking among the excess and ostentatious surpluses that is perhaps little transparent in old Europe, but important for the quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels like he's at home.
And I'm sure not in Dubai.
Running away from the world of magic, I broke his gold mask, revealing the other faces of an artificial paradise.
It's a count that doesn't speak loud and doesn't write.
I'm showing the need of the Asians, contrasting with the basic conditions of the divine ethnic caste of Dubains, the grandsons of the illiterate Bedouins.
I'm running into extreme poverty, such as a ghetto on the city border, where an army of Asian workers is living under cruel conditions.
That is what they built in one generation under the conditions of slavery in the desert of Manhattan.
They came here with good earnings and the opportunity to provide a decent life for their families, and they remained a nightmare.
This tourist will never see because it could be planted in the air created by the years mit Dubai.
The growing criticism of the international community has led to the fact that the subject of cheap labour becomes very difficult for the emir.
Mel C of the Spice Girls team has banned talks about diets in her home after her fights with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm of the Spice Girls team admitted that there was a ban on the use of diets in her home after she had been able to cope with eating disorders for years, eating only fruit and vegetables.
For years, Spice’s sports did not eat and “obsessively practiced” as a result of the pressure associated with being a famous member of the pop group around the world, which later caused depression and malnutrition.
She now reveals that her experiences affect the way Scarlet's daughter is raised, so she "does not allow her home to talk about diets".
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I'm beginning to notice that he's more aware of his appearance," Mel said.
“I think that one of the ways I can experience eating disorders is that I am very aware of the way I speak about it.
The use of a positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview with the magazine Women's Health Mel, who was famous in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that in the days before the emergence of social media mixed in the press, comments on her subject were made by complex.
"I began to look at myself in an inappropriate way, abandoning certain groups of foods, exercising more and more obsessive until I began to be uneasy," he says.
"I was sick and it probably lasted a few years."
A picture that shook the world
The Polish girl and American documentaryist gave the world a witness about the atrocities of war.
Photo by Julien Bryana can be viewed at World War II Museum in Gdansk
"Listen to my story.
I'm talking from the walled city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America has to act, it has to help!", he started his radio presentation documentaryist, photographer, Julien Bryan.
In a tragic September 1939, he was in the capital of Poland, seeing the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His relationship took place in the West.
President of Warsaw Stefan Starrzyński helped him first, borrowed his car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a farewell letter to the family in the United States, deposited it in the embassy safe and... stayed.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be where the gardeners were.
400 planes and artillery almost non-stop attacked the city.
Bryan lived on pictures of death, suffering, struggle to survive in the city plains.
Just before the surrender, he and the embassies carried out negatives about the ocean.
He didn't stop talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: "What has happened to Warsaw is a meeting of Paris, London and even New York".
His alarming chronicles watched President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began to prepare for war.
“Dad showed the truth and thus fought German propaganda.
They made films that glorify their wealth.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, son of Julien.
Case before the jury of the jury against the former sportsman accused of numerous rapes
In front of the lion of the jury there is a process of violence committed by the former baseball team of the University of Delaware, which is accused of numerous sexual assaults.
On Friday after 10 days of the submission of the certificates and hearing of the arguments, the jury members of the jury joined in resolving the 23-year-old Clay Conaway.
A woman who was 21 years old says Conaway raped her when she went to his house in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the two meetings were closed on Bumble's meeting page and the women were sent by the man of the picture on which he presented himself.
The woman is one of six Conaway accused of sexual assault in the years 2013-2018.
In the complainant’s view, the plea against which the woman’s consent was expressed turned into violence.
The defenders refer to the opposite relationships between women and the gaps in the memory and say that the woman probably regretted that she had come close to the intimate.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for millions of gold
The gold-covered gold bike worth millions of gold could be seen on the jubilee, the 10th edition of the International Rover fairs Kielce BIKE-EXPO.
This is an extraordinary vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His designer, 30-year-old Adam Danowicz, just got him an Oscar bike at the World's Custom Rover Show in Las Vegas.
Rover is covered with a golden sodium chromium, under which is the highest silver sample.
It's an unusual coating made by my colleague from Jör.
"If it's a seat, it's a pedal, it's a driver, it could be normal for him to drive.
It can grow at a speed of 50 kilometers per hour.
It's an electric bike," says his designer.
‘The bike is printed on a 3D printer.
They're six types of virus.
I came up with the idea of this model riding on my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on the card and I hid it deep into the sink.
She's been waiting for five years.
The bike was built for three years," adds Adam Zdanovich.
"It was extremely difficult to hide all elements under the body.
Inside are batteries, wires, building elements.
It is hidden under a body embedded in 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
There's an engine hidden there, too.
The guide to this bike was set up a week before my trip to the United States at the World Rover Show.
I couldn't decide what kind of driver this is.
She's a transporter.
Rover weighs 90 kilograms," he sums up.
The gold-covered bike was awarded in Las Vegas the most important competition category "Best incredibly unique custom copy".
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist sites
The Sydney Bay surrounded by the opera building, the Circular Quay port, the Luna Park amusement park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge is making a significant contribution to the $21.9 billion amount, which is annually loaded into the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
But under the bridge, the ugly truth is hidden.
The famous Sydney Bay is one of the most contaminated waterways in the country, which affects the volume of pollution of about 15 Olympic pools each year.
These frightening statistics make one of our biggest tourist attractions at the same time one of our most filthy havens.
According to the new film material entitled "Sydney Bay – Up and Down", the waters around Australia's most popular city are full of waste, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, all of which flow into the bay along with rainwater.
However, the largest part of the body breathing our shipping channels is plastic.
"I'd call it paradox," said Dr. Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Programme, on 27 September, where the publication of this film is held in the course of World Tourism Day.
This water looks beautiful, but it's one of the most changed and contaminated rivers along our coast.
The CSIRO Agency estimates that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic will be transferred to our waterways, and most of it will be affected by storm sewerage.
"After such powerful floods of the Gulf... it seems rather tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two thirds of the pollutants come from rainwater.
However, as in the case of high ice, the problem with the Sydney Bay is much more serious under the water surface, as 70% of the plastic entering the ocean reaches the bottom of the sea.
"I don't think it's possible to really know what's in the bottom," said Richard Nichols, owner of the Dive Centre Manly, pointing out that he and his team are pulling about 500 kg of plastic out of the water on their own.
I think if more people knew (what's under the water) they'd be just scared.
It's impressive... over half what we find at the bottom is plastic nets.
The other 50% are things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the pond, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and the rest of the trash we're making right under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and director of Ocean Protect, said that there are ways in which people – both local and tourist alike – could help reduce the number of plastics and residues present in our waterways.
"This must start at the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic used by us, better conduct material returns and have a greater awareness of what we are dumping into the liquids that eventually hit the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we're starving because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of the carbon dioxide and our source of food.
However, we can arrange this dam and restore it to its former glory, which is very simple.
If we die our oceans, we'll kill ourselves too.
The film material funded by TOMRA recycling company in its broader efforts to educate Australians in the field of environmental protection and to reduce the negative impact of containers on drinks that often affect the environment takes place during the study on the interdependence between artificial and mental health products published this month.
The new survey conducted among 546 children aged 12 to 18 years found that 82% of respondents felt helpless to plastic waste and 25% of adults' guilt for the problem of disposable plastic packaging.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth of the magnitude of parents' concerns, and 93% of the 551 surveyed parents said they were growing concerns about the amount of plastic waste present in the oceans.
Many people who participated in the study said that they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes that led to environmental fear.
Poland – Slovenia.
Mems after match netters in semi-final ME
It wasn't an easy match.
The Slovenians had a vital public on their side, which effectively deconcentrated Polish netizens.
Many controversy has also been sparked by judges who, in one of the actions, have not been able to take four steps on the part of the economy.
This happened at the key moment of the first set, when the subsidiary Vitala Heynen had the chance to jump off the rivals and win the first party.
However, it did not happen, and the Polish finally had to recognize the height of the race that won 3:1 in the finals of the tournament.
Ghana: Kaneshie Dealers Support the Psychiatric Hospital in Accra
The members of the Kaneshie Market Association gave 30 000 GH last night food to the psychiatric hospital in Accra during the short ceremony that took place in Accra.
This is an item of action within the framework of the 40th anniversary of the Kaneshie Market Complex.
Among other things, various food items, fruits, non-alcoholic beverages, teas, clothing, purées, paradise bananas, maniocs and waterworks were included.
During the visit, the group also talked to several patients on the site.
The event was attended by members of the Management Board of Accra Markets Limited, the Directors of Association and the Royal Mothers.
In presenting the subjects, Mrs. Mercy Naa Afrova Needjan, president of the Women's Association of the Market of the Great Akra region, announced that the donation is a regular element of the welfare group's social responsibility.
She noted that support for hospital care was needed to show them love and allow them to feel part of society.
Mrs. Needjan promised hospital support from the association and called on other associations to follow up on this gesture.
Taking the presents, Dr. Pinnaman Appau, the director of the hospital, approved the association for support and promised that it would be used well for the benefit of patients.
She appealed to other hospital support organizations.
Google is creating a cloud in Poland.
PKO BP partner
The National Cloud Operator, PKO BP and PFR, has entered into a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is intended to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of computing cloud technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the Land Cloud Operator, and Google will open in Warsaw the so-called Google Cloud region – i.e. the hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the Central and Eastern Europe region.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global, public computing cloud installation in Central Europe.
Polish companies were one of the key foundations of the project to create the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Poland and by the Polish Development Fund, the participants of this company.
The National Cloud Partnership and Google is another important step on the road that we took a year ago, announcing the call of the National Cloud Operator.
The objective remains unchanged – digitising the Polish economy and dynamising its growth.
"Now Polish companies are getting additional, refined tools for its implementation.
Using them, they increase their chances of advancing to the world league, which we all care about.
The fact that Google joins them today greatly reinforces our joint project," says Zbigniew Jagelova, president of the PKO Bank of Poland.
The Polish Development Fund notes that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.
"The investment in the National Cloud Operator is ideally incorporated into the PFR strategy as an important element of the country's digitisation.
It will provide modern and affordable business solutions based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and attract the best specialists to it," adds Pavel Borys, president of the PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all key Google Cloud Platform products such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner or BigQuery.
The inclusion of Google Cloud services in the offer of the Land Cloud will allow Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies that they use for their global competition.
However, we will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators," says Mikhał Potoczek, President of the State Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as the Internet stuff (IoT), which often increase the need for the computational power needed to process huge data collections.
VI General Polish Parade for Seniors
On the same afternoon, 24 August 2019, at Ronde de Gaulle's in Warsaw, the VI Seniors' Parade "Dirzali Magnaiali" and Piknik Pokolen, the events organized by the Foundation of Zaczyn began.
“ The Council is an event on a global scale, ” says the Wisniewski Industry of the Foundation.
The sixth time has passed through the centre of Warsaw to highlight how large and diverse communities are seniors.
Through Paradise, we oppose harmful stereotypes affecting older people and call for intergenerational solidarity."
The parade was conducted by a special floor bus serving as a musical mobile scene on which a traditionally famous Warsaw DJ Wika had already performed.
The participants in the happy choir, at the second known Warsaw and world breakthroughs, passed through the Jerusalem Alleys, Kručka Street to the Warsaw Posstancs Square, Mazowiečka Street to the Pilsudski Square and the Royal and Krakow Premester Street to the Campus of the University of Warsaw.
During the march, in which several thousand seniors, representing 300 senior organisations from all over Poland, were involved, the colouring delegations were welcomed by numerous representatives of the march, Warsaw and tourists.
From Legionow to Parade, two organized groups took part in the corporate yellow and blue shirts.
The first representative of the University of the IIIth Century and the Senior+ Club and the second under the name of SAGA, the Senior Active Animator Group.
In Campus University organizers prepared gastronomic and numerous stands of institutions and companies offering seniors services and products to improve their daily life and functioning.
There are medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.
For example, on the Stylish Seniors of Senior Voice from professional Hanny Piekarski and designer Agnieszki Wrwal, you could get tips and information about current trends in fashion 60+.
Stoisko also offered the science workshop to move around the scene and take pictures.
It was a show of the fashion of Stylish Seniors.
The latest edition of letters and materials related to the “Stop Manipulation – Don’t Buy for Presentation” campaign was found at the Stop of the Polish Senior’s Voice.
Other stands offered cosmetic, moving, plastic and artistic workshops.
Several studies and consultations could be conducted with health and nutrition experts.
Discussion panels were also organized with Helen Norowić, Beaty Tadli, Marioli Bojarskie-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacikow or Robert Janowski.
There were no vocal and music attractions on the picnic.
The tradition of the Polish song – Krzysztof Krawczyk – appeared on the stage, and in the evening an intergenerational dancing took place that led to DJ Wika.
The Tasmanian devils can provide guidance on cancer treatment
The Tasmanian demons may have a key to cancer treatment – researchers have performed breakthrough detection that can revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered how to mask certain tumour cells
Researchers have found that the same process applies to the Tasmanian demons and to humans
There is hope that this discovery will bring new methods of treatment for cancer patients
What do the Tasmanian demons and people have in common?
New cell cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCalum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolutionize the treatment of certain cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also include a key to the treatment of mortal tumors within the face that threaten the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
The study established a way to mask certain tumour cells in both humans and in the bag, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which excludes a marker that would otherwise give signal to the resistance system to the attack on the tumour.
This may be the biggest challenge in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastomas and the type of skin cancer called Merkel cell cancer.
"The crucial importance of this project is that in patients who occasionally develop resistance to immunological therapy, we can be able to reverse this process," said AAP Chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapies can be used to re-activate markers, proteins called MHCs, allowing the immune system to recognize tumour cells.
"It is potentially far-reaching for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
“It’s one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we'll be able to treat her a lot better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will be used to treat the tumors of the Tasmanian devil’s face, where tumour cells similarly avoid detection.
"It is unusual that exactly the same process occurs (in the case of innovations in human beings and the Tasmanian devils)," said Professor Dawson.
“It has been very difficult to treat the Tusman devil’s tumors so far.
But if medicines that work in humans can also be used in the Tasmanian devils, there is the possibility that this will help control the disease."
Scientists are surprised by the fact that around a really small star a very large planet is surrounded by
Scientists express surprise after discovering a solar system 30 years of light from Earth, which subjugates our current understanding of the processes of planet creation, since this system is a large planet similar to that of Jovis around a small star called the red car.
Artistic illustration of the GJ 3512b-like gas-type planet surrounding the central star of red-knit, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets surrounding them.
However, as scientists said on Thursday, stars and planets vary slightly in size.
The size of a star called GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the mass of the planet that surrounds it is at least half the mass of Jovis, the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it's an absolute surprise," said Astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Institute of Space Research, who was the head of research published in the journal Science.
The discovery is surprising because the theoretical models of solar systems suggest that low-weight stars usually become maternal stars for smaller planets like Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we discovered a planet of a giant gas type similar to the one that's around a very small star," Morales added.
This planet, like Jovisz, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope in the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It surrounds its star after a very elliptical orbit, and the full circle lasts 204 days.
Red spots are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 star is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent it has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, as it is only about 35% larger than Jovis.
They emit less energy, so they are lighter than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately 3800 degrees Fahrenheit (6380 degrees Fahrenheit/3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they have red colours," Morales said.
"There is evidence of the existence of a second planet currently circulating around this star, while the third planet could be thrown out of the star system in the past, which could explain the elliptical orbit of a planet like Jovis," said Morales.
The planets are made up of the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that produces the star around which the planets are orbiting.
According to the leading model of planet creation called accretion model, the object is initially formed from particles fixed in the disk, and the gravitational force of the planet at an early stage of development allows for the creation of an atmosphere of surrounding gas.
This non-typical system can explain a competitive model called gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be a little more massive than we expect and may be cold," said Morales.
This leads to a problem of disk stability, and therefore some denser areas may appear.
These masses can grow until they fall and create a planet.
Delicacy worker accused of co-administration of a fasoleic dipus containing methamphetamine
The Sheriff's office in Marion County stopped Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38 years old, for the use of a phasol dipu with methamphetamine.
On Thursday, 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez from Albania was accused of delivering methamphetamine and causing the consumption of this substance controlled by another person – both crimes are crimes of a second degree.
The complaint was filed on the basis of a 9 September event in the Thriftway food store in Jefferson.
In a statement made by the OregonLive.com portal showing the likelihood of guilt, a 27-year-old associate of the suspect told the deputy mayor of Marion that during lunch break she saw Medina-Hernandez making a phasole dip, which she then attended.
On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of the crime, who, according to what she said to the investigator, never took methamphetamines, said that “she thought that one of the pieces eaten by her tasted strangely, but did not arouse it in them any suspicions”.
When she got back to work, she felt that she had a stomach disorder and that she couldn't stand up.
According to the paper by Albany Democrat-Herald, she managed to go to a local hospital where it was found that a phasole dip could contain methamphetamine.
On the basis of reports from The Smoking Gun portal, another Thriftway network official said that Medina-Hernandez "was telling her to add drugs to the food," while others admitted that the suspect had sent her message, claiming that methamphetamine had gone into a phrasal dip by accident.
The OregonLive Web site informs about the recording from the delicacy monitoring, which is said to show how the back to the Medina-Hernandez camera pulls something out of the biustonous, becomes a microwave and hangs out.
Then she straightens out, she wipes her nose, comes to the table and puts a beans dip in a small paper dish.
According to the police, the thing she pulled from the biustonous was also probably on the plate.
Oregano Statesman-Journal reports that the staff of the sheriff's office say there is no doubt that the food is being contaminated.
Medina-Hernandez lives in Marion County Prison – a security deposit of $520 000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that the woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, the supply of methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine and possession of illicit weapons.
Johnson's giving a kiss in the mix of the detachment
Boris Johnson's trip to the United Nations General Assembly was inextricably interrupted by the historic judgement of the Supreme Court.
However, his coercive speech in the Gmin Chamber did not betray either shame nor cast a conscience.
To explain the meaning of this transformation, Tony Connelly, editor of the European RTE section in Brussels and London correspondent Sean Whelan in Westminster, is in the eye of the cyclone.

Marian Banasz.
What does KAS do about Chief Nik?
Renting real estate at a lower market price is a reservation that arises in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Court of Control of Marian Banasis.
What the treasure is doing in this matter, we asked the Treasury Board in Krakow and the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel, in his report for "Supervisor" TVN, expressed doubts about the claims made by the President of the Supreme Court of Control of Marian Banasis.
For a few months now, the Central Anti-Corruption Office has been investigating.
Control is due to end in the second half of October, after parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was to rent a stone with an area of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received 61.7 thousand gold each year.
The "Supervisor" report revealed that the hotel was located in a stone rented by him for an hour.
The head of the NIC explained later on on state television why he only took over 5,000 gold a month for the rent of the property.
"Vehicle magazine", referring to experts from the valuation of real estate, she estimated that it should be 15 thousand gold a month behind the stone itself.
"The amount was lower because of the simple reason: I entered into a preliminary contract and it was precisely that the tenant was going to buy this stone that led me to agree on a lower charge that the remaining items would be counted when selling the stone," Banas convinced.
However, doubts arose as to whether such action was a violation of the law.
Konrad Zawada, the press spokesman of the Treasury Chamber in Krakow, informed TVN24 that "the Ministry of Finance is directly involved in this matter".
"All such questions please send to the Minister of Finance," he added.
Zavada explained that in such cases "the State Treasury is acting".
The press release of the Ministry of Finance, Pavel Jurek, admitted that the National Treasury itself is monitoring a number of cases that may cause some reservations.
"The Treasury Administration operates in such a way that it has its own information, as it is based in a sense on this information that is publicly available.
On this basis, it decides whether or not there is a specific matter to be dealt with, whether or not," MF spokesperson explained.
"However, because we are all subject to a secret treasure fund in the entire range of finances, we never speak, because we cannot speak in individual cases of a particular taxpayer, a particular person or a particular company," he stressed, asked questions about the Mariana Banasis case.
The Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwietinski stressed that "the treasure offices do not communicate this type of message to the public".
"It is known that the whole treasure machine deals with very similar cases across the country," he said.
Secrets of the royal family: amazing visitors often flying the royal plane
As part of their service duties, members of the royal family must travel hundreds of times around the world.
This usually facilitates a royal aircraft – a private machine that drives a royal family around the world for important events and events.
It's no surprise that having your own plane is connected to privileges.
Members of the royal family do not have to stand on long lines to repair, do not apply their limit on the number of luggage, and may, as it turns out, invite any guests – including truly unaccompanied ones.
According to a recent premiere on Channel 5 of the documentary film not only the Queen and Prince Philip often travel by royal aircraft.
During the program entitled "King's Flight Secrets", a king's flight navigator revealed that guests often flew with the king's family.
Bob Shields said: “Sometimes with our very important royal guests, very important royal dogs could fly. ”
It does not surprise the queen that she could have wished her loved ones to accompany her on her journey, for she is known for her deep attachment to the dog breed.
Since the youngest years, Queen Elizabeth has been a lover of these four-dimensional creatures and has been listening to the fact that since the coronation she has owned more than 30 choirs.
It is said that in 2007 she had five choirs: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
Five cockers were added to them: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Spain, as well as the four dogs that are cross-breeding a cow from Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The king's plane crew must have had full hands.
A staff member of the royal house carrying out dogs and asking them to provide their needs before taking them on board a plane – says Shields.
I'm glad to know that there's never been an incident.
The programme also revealed a shocking number of luggage that the queen carries on board during her travel in the performance of her duties.
The film writer stated: “In 1953 the queen took a 12 - ton luggage on her trip of 70,000 miles [70,000 km] in 1953. ”
To be able to see it better, it's less than two huge elephants.
However, the queen is not the only person who has the weakness of fashion.
Similarly, Princess Cambridge also has its own tastes for the carriage of her wardrobe – it is said that each of her dresses has a separate seat.
The new law enters into force.
Damaged in Cases of Remuneration
On Friday, a regulation will enter into force to ensure that in cases of serious injury, further payment of the rent will be made – the Financial Handbook informs.
The Act of 9 July 2019 on the special powers of the injured persons in the event of the exhaustion of the guarantee amount established on the basis of the provisions in force before 1 January 2006.
It concerns persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
In some cases, the insurers have already stopped paying the rent.
"I am glad of this regulation because our institution has been running a mechanism for many years to ensure that in cases of serious damage, financial support from the OC communication insurance or the OC of the farmer is guaranteed, despite the amount of the guarantee," says Aleksander Daszewski, a legal adviser at the Office of the Financial Accountant.
According to the Financial Handbook, this was necessary because it is often very tragic situations for people in very poor health, who cannot work due to accidents, for example, and at the same time bear significant costs of accidental rehabilitation.
Part of them no longer provided compensation and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the so-called 'guarantee sum' in the OC policies.
Part of it was threatened in the next few years.
By 1 January 2006, the limit of liability of the insurer was significantly lower than that of the present.
This is why the problem of exhausting the guarantee amount in previous years was most often affecting people who suffered injury in the 1990s.
At that time, the guarantee amounts were very low and the economic conditions led to a significant increase in prices.
"We also noted that this problem also affected a number of young people mostly who suffered injury during the period when the amount was EUR 350 thousand per victim.
Currently, it is EUR 5.21 million for the event, regardless of the number of victims.
So this is a huge difference in relation to earlier periods, from which the problem required the intervention of the legislator," recalls Aleksander Daszewski.
It explains that, given that the guarantee amount is raised at any time, the legislator has accepted that the upper limit of liability of the Insurance Fund will be the guarantee amount in force at the time of the referral to the Pension Claim Fund.
This principle shall apply if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay the rent on the basis of a judgment of the court determining the amount of the guarantee other than that laid down in the OC insurance agreement.
This is the case where the amount of the guarantee is raised on a judicial basis under Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows for the modification of the existing binding relationship.
"In recent days, we have sent letters to people who in the past have come to us with an application for intervention.
We inform them of new powers and of course we will ensure that further support can be provided if any problems arise," says Aleksander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted of cutting the boy's penis
The case concerns the events of November 2017.
According to Buenos Aires Times, then Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend had shown a familiar sex system that had arisen in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old who is an architect from education explained to the court that the partner thus ruined her life and treated her with nothing "trofeum", which can be praised in front of friends.
"He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything," she argued.
The Cordoba resident decided to measure justice himself.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed and told him she had a special surprise.
By means of an assimilated pad, she blinded his eyes, and then she caught the trigger and cut off his penis.
"I felt like I was going to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, pulled down and picked up the phone to get ready," he said.
“I wanted to leave, but she began to insult me.
She caught me for a shirt and hair, not letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had hurt her by revealing our sex systems, she did not try to get away from responsibility.
"Please measure justice," she said to the jury.
Finally, she was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former state congressman Alabama Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, a retired state congressman named Alabama died on behalf of the Republican Party of Jack Edwards, who served for 10 years and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
The family accountant said Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after fighting a new puzzle.
Edwards was originally elected to the American Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans of Alabama in the Deep South because of the party winning supporters here.
He served 10 positions in Congress.
According to a statement issued by the family in response to a recent question about what the world would want to leave to its lawyers and lawyers, Edwards replied that he would want to return courtesy.
"I hope that my lawyers and my lawyers will grow up in a country where mutual debate and efforts to solve the problems of the country will be restored," said Edwards, according to the family statement.
The Governor of the state of Alabama Kay Ivey said Edwards was serving his position and the country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that for his honor, the flag on the Alabama State Capitol will be left to half the mast.
"He was the person of a real state official and was the best husband for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of the most significant policies," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspired" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed high regard for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling Princess Sussex "a careful leader who breaks the schematics and makes our world better".
The Prince and Prince Harry, currently on a ten-day royal trip to South Africa with their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, participated in a youth meeting at the beginning of this week, during which they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Royal City, Princess Sussex @sussexroyal, "a careful leader who breaks the plans and makes our world better," wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic post.
"Whether it's meeting with Obama Foundation leaders, or helping girls around the world to gain access to the education they deserve, is an inspiration for many people," Obama added, adding a picture representing a smiling Meghan featuring the foundation leaders.
Meghan conducted an interview with Obama for the September edition of the British Vogue, which was hosted by the former actor of the series "Suits".
In a sincere conversation, the first lady spoke about motherhood and how it changed.
"Being a mother means bringing the art of forgiveness to the championship," Obama said in an interview.
"Maternity has taught me that for most of my time it is my job to give children space so they can get to know the world and become who they want to be.
Not who I want to be or who I wanted to be in their age, but who they are in their hearts.
Obama, who knows from experience what the pressure of being on the candle is, shared with the priestly council during his interview with the Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The pressure that you feel – thrown by yourself and others – can sometimes push you," she said.
"So my advice is to relax and not rush into anything.
For the first few months in the White House, I spent most of my time worrying about my daughter, making sure that they were doing well in school and making new acquaintances before I dedicated myself to more ambitious work.
I think it's necessary, too.
Hotel Trump reserves permission to sell alcohol despite complaints about the owner's training
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Commission on Alcohol Control in Washington has withdrawn the request to verify whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose the authorisation to sell alcohol because of the owner’s training.
The Agency has ruled on the ground that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis is unfounded because most of them do not live in the district or have no real estate in it.
"The Washington Post" says that the second time you have been asked to withdraw an alcohol permit from the hotel, calling for a provision in force in the district that says that an applicant for an alcohol permit must prove to be "a good skill".
In the original complaint lodged last year, President Donald Trump was alleged to be breaking the law, and charges of assault and repeated cases of fraud were brought.
The complaint was dismissed because the authorisation was granted before it was lodged.
The reason for the second complaint was the extension of the authorisation.
"The Sun": Intermediate report recognizes that the police service scandal in Cleveland is the worst in Britain
The inspectors have recognized the SCANDALAMI COOPERATION as the worst police in the United Kingdom.
In the interim report, police work in Cleveland was considered inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Inspectorate of Her Royal City said that there was a "significant deterioration" of standards in police services in Cleveland.
New calls for police services were made, with five commanders taking the lead in six years.
According to the report, police did not try to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Inspectorate of Her Royal City Police said: "Our last inspection has resulted in a significant deterioration of standards."
Commander Mike Veale resigned in January after the fall of the year in the light of an investigation into "serious", but unintelligible, allegations of his conduct.
Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts has been suspended after arrest on the ground of serious misconduct.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood approached the commission for the recruitment of employees for sexual activity.
He's out of service.
Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen of the Tours said: “It is an official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time for the Home Office department to intervene."
Police Commander Richard Lewis said: "After the improvements, I will take full responsibility for the conduct of police forces through changes."
We've got a picture of the skatepark!
Do young people finally wait?
Older residents are hampered by young people's passions for the rides on hulajnogs and decorails, and they complain that there is no suitable place for them in Olava.
Young people have been reminded of the place to drive on rollers, decoils, bunnies, bikes.
The subject is still coming back to our ruins.
We've been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
Last time there was a rumor about the lack of a skatepark.
That's why we're going back to that again and asking at the office what's next?
We remember that a few days ago, a woman who was disturbed by a youth driving downtown.
"I write on behalf of the inhabitants of the Pilsudski block in order to be able to take an interest in the situation of the young man", Malgorzat writes.
"The residents of the block called repeatedly to the City Guard in vain.
For proof of such daily situations, I sent photos together."
We asked others about this.
The majority clearly say that young people simply do not have a place to drive in the city and that they have been demanding places for themselves for years.
Under the Facebook post, a lion's comment appeared.
We wrote in July that there was a chance of a skatepark being built in the Olava Town.
The mayor informed us that the city had been funded by the Skatepark building.
"The project consulted with young people together with permits is ready.
On 28 March, an application was made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for the funding of the project under the Polish Sports Programme “Budawa Skatepark in Olawa”” told us in the office.
Total project value: 798 306,00 zł
Amount of grant applied for: 263 440,00 zł.
Now we've asked again what stage the matter is.
"We do not yet have any information on the relationship between the solutions made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism of the application for funding," Elżbieta Bednarczyk, head of the European UM Oława Fund, informs Elżbieta Bednarczyk.
"The information received from the Ministry staff shows that the final selection of all tasks under the Polish Sports Programme should take place in October".
We also asked for the visualization of the Olava Skatepark.
We present it below.
The youth informed the editor that on Saturday (September 28th) they would collect signatures on request concerning the construction of the Skatepark in Olava.
"The rebel young man saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they were organizing the collection," writes Mikolaj.
The signatures under request will be collected from 12 noon in the vicinity of the Lidl market.
Polish Cup 2019/20: 1/16 final draw.
We know couples, hit years ago
It was one of the most interesting rivals in the extraclass.
The biggest legend has been the memory match since 1996/1997.
On June 18, 1997, the Legia took over a previous team at the old stadium of the Lazinkska boat.
Both teams divided the point.
The masters had to win, the second of the Polish championships gave a score.
Up to 87 minutes Legia drove 2:0, but for five more minutes the earthquake hit the ground – Vidzew shot three goals and enjoyed the title.
The Łódź club with its years of running fell into increasing tarapats until it ceased to count in the battle for the championship and fell from the highest playing class.
For the last time, both teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
The legia – along the way to title – brought two victories – 5:1 with her and 1:0 on her way out.
Return to elite
At present, shipping is fighting to return to the national elite.
These plans have been delayed for at least a year, as in previous games, being one of the favorites, they have not been able to advance on extraclauses.
As a result of this failure in the summer, the club has reached a military revolution.
The authorities have changed, finally put on coach Marcin Kaczmark, and in making another step up the club hierarchy they have to help the league fighters Marcin Robak and Mateusz Mojdženj.
At the moment Vidzew is the fourth in Table II of the League, but in Puchara Polski won the 2nd Wrocław Wrocław on Tuesday.
The legia in the same size played the game on the exit of the Unbreakable Desert.
Extraordinary start
The only pair of top-class representatives in the 1/16 finals will make her benamins LKS and Gornnik Zabrze.
The matches will take place from 29 to 31 October.
This year, 1/8 finals (December 3-5) are scheduled to be played.
The final will be held on 2 May at the National PGE in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr "refused" and the investigation under impeachment must be directed to his own
We never know where we're going.
Now I think we are taking part in an attempt to hide the facts of the fact of the fact, and the investigation in this case can take place," Pelosi said in an interview with the CNN on the Capitol Hill.
"They are doing the work they started, keeping the facts and the time needed to find them," she added.
The protocol issued this week by the White House shows that Trump has asked the President of Ukraine for a study on former Vice-President Joe Biden, the 2020 candidate, and his son.
Trump also asked Zejlenski to cooperate with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as a result of the protocol.
Trump denied that he did anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Department of Justice have notified a complaint by the complainant concerning the Trup with Ukraine's participation more than a week before the formal notification.
After receiving a complaint from the intelligence community officials, the Justice Department found that Trump’s phone conversation did not provide a criminal investigation into the financing of the campaign.
Asked whether Barr should testify, Pelosi said that on Friday the Intelligence Committee would decide who to be called to testify.
She added, however, that in her view, Barr "refused himself".
It's been a long time.
"But (Barra) is listed in all this," Pelosi added, referring to Trump's reference to his Attorney General during July's talks with the head of Ukraine.
It is interesting that he made decisions on how to deal with the complaint.
Pelosi announced that he was "very afraid" of informants who Trump attacked as spies on Thursday, suggesting that they had been treated with spies in the past.
I think the President's words go beyond irresponsibleness, it's dangerous.
Our signalers play an important role in the detection of irregularities in our government," Pelosi said, adding "The President's words about people who can provide information signalers seriously undermine government honesty".
On Tuesday Pelosi took a historic step of announcing a formal investigation into the conduct of an act incompatible with the law on the basis of an alleged attempt to place pressure on the leader of a foreign country in order to obtain political benefits.
The telephone conversation was included in the statement published on Thursday of the complaint, in which the alarmist claimed that Trump had abused his authority to "feel Ukraine into interference" during the forthcoming 2020 elections.
The signaller also ordered that the White House lawyers have instructed officials to remove the conversation from the computer system in which they are stored for the needs of the Council of Ministers and to place it in the system for particularly sensitive information.

Possible ban on driving too fast for the attacker of the Crystal Palace Christian Bentece
The Prime Minister of the League of Christian Bentece, which has been caught twice in the last two months at speed, threatens to ban vehicles.
The attacker Crystal Palace, 28 years old, admitted to drive by Bentley's car at 80 miles per hour on the ground with a limit of up to 50 miles per hour on A3 in Richmond on 20 January.
Then in March, photographers in Putney in south-west London registered Belgium at a speed of 89 miles per hour, which is twice the limit of 40 miles per hour.
Bentece from Kingston Hill from Surrey doesn't have to be in the Room Court this morning at Lavender Hill.
He committed two irregularities at the beginning of July in the context of a simplified procedure on the basis of which the offences are more easily convicted at a meeting held by one judge of peace.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned about the structure of the Verification Commission
Kofi Manu, the football manager and representative of Sekondi Hasacas, expressed doubts about the composition of the Verification Commission for the upcoming elections to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, adding that he is not pleased with his participation.
In his interview with GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would be honest because the outcome of the verification process was in his interest.
The Verification Commission should consist of non-neutral persons from outside who do not have any links with any of the members and who have not previously shown any interest.
For example, Davies hired the NC as a lawyer who wrote to the Kwak Palmer Axis with respect to payment of 10 per cent.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position in the Verification Commission because he is interested in this," he said.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games, was before the Commission, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President on account of his relationship with the club, at the same time suggesting that if he was before the Commission, he would be the subject of bias and bias.
As expected, members of the Commission were expected to start work from yesterday, after holding a ceremony at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Tuesday, 19 September, and to complete it on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies and her members are Consultant of the Corporate Government and Lawyer Marian Barnor and Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Laryea, Marketing and Business Director and Richard Akpokavie, Sports Administrator and Lawyer.
‘SE’: Kornel Morawiecki in a difficult condition in a hospital
Marshal Colonel Morawiecki, the legend of Solidarity and the father of Prime Minister Mateus Morawiecki, went back to the hospital – he informs "Super Express".
Politicians are in a difficult situation.
The 78-year-old Cornel Morawiecki has been struggling with pancreatic cancer for months.
He's been feeling better lately.
According to “Super Express”, during the last interview with the newspaper, which took place two weeks ago, the senior marshal was “in a great way”.
Now, however, the condition of the Prime Minister’s health has deteriorated significantly.
Colonel Morawiecki went to the hospital, and the doctors define his condition as difficult.
The senior marshal's family handed over "SE" that politics is aware of and fully aware of.
This is not the only disease that Cornel Morawiecki is dealing with.
He also has problems with the heart, and with the chemotherapy he's going through, also with his kidneys.
Colonel Morawiecki is applying in this year's parliamentary elections for the senator's mandate in PiS's letter to Podlas.

Israel: There is no agreement on the government of unity
The two main parts of Israel, the Alliance of White and White, continued on Friday negotiations on the establishment of a unity government.
The meeting, which took place after the President’s mission to form the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, did not produce results.
The talks considered the possibility of rotating the leadership of both parties in the government and the rest of Netanjahu at the prime minister's position, but – as the Israeli newspaper Haarec writes – no closer views were drawn.
The talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Alliance of the Blue and White informed in a communication that it had presented the preliminary submissions.
He accuses Likud of "sitting in his position", claiming that his leader and former Prime Minister Netanyahu remain at the head of the government, and in the cabinet, which was previously part of his ultra-orthodox politics.
"From the very beginning it has been known that the Blue-Whites do not agree with these conditions," the Communication published by them said.
For those who, acting solely in the interest of Netanjahu, want to "make Israel a second round of elections".
Benny Gantz, the leader of the White White Benny, refuses to support the government that Netanjahu would lead, until they are charged with engaging in three corruption cases on the basis of which the prosecutor could formally charge him after the meeting.
"Liquef and Blue-White have obtained a sufficient majority in the elections on 17 September, which would allow them to join the common governments as natural allies, but it will force them to negotiate which none of the parties wanted," writes the EFE Agency.
President Reuwen Riwlin has tried to bring their positions closer in recent days and has proposed the call for a "rotation government", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his functions, which would allow Gantz to hold this position if charges against Netanjahu were maintained and formalised.
There are no Israeli analysts who believe that things have been caught in a blind alley.
However, half of the Israelis, as a result of the poll published on Friday by the public television, want to unlock the political situation in the country by calling the government of a rotating leader for Netanjahu and Gantza.
This is what 50.6% of the Israelis say, and 32.1% of the respondents object to this.
The survey shows a deep division in Israeli society – the question of who should first become head of the cabinet, 41.8% of respondents refer to Netanjahu and 40% to Gantz.
In another survey published by the newspaper 'Israel Hajm', the percentage of supporters of the unity government rose to 63%, 60% opposed the new elections, which would be the third this year.
In the early parliamentary elections on 17 September, the Gantz Alliance won 33 seats in the 120th place, Likud Netanjahu won 32 seats.
Netanjahu with his traditional and potential allies can count on the support of 55 apostles, while Gantz can count on 54.
None of the pageantities have collected 61 mandates necessary for the majority.
Tipuric calls for fighting before the final game with Australians
Justin Tipuric says that "it's time to check" when Valia is faced with the final game with Australia under the World Cup, which can shape their fate in the tournament.
The victory of Valia over the kangaroos would put this team at the position of a certain favourite to win Group D and ensure its participation in the likely quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia beats Wallia once again 14 during the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be sent to the front of England in one eight final.
"Let's make it clear that both teams want to go through this and be on the front of the group," said the waly warrior Tipuric.
In the past there have been some difficult results, but last autumn it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they're going to try hard to get us this victory, and we're going to have to take them back.
Before we got here, you knew it would be a big old man.
And now we're here, and it's really time to check.
Valia had only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or RPA in the history of the World Cup – and it took place 32 years ago in a third place match when the kangaroos were defeated.
And their total record under the lead of Coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to defeat three teams of heavy weight from the southern hemisphere.
Valia represented the course of thirteen Australian-run tests last November, and Tipuric prepared to be among the few survivors of this 9-6 victory that will run to the Tokyo stadium on Sunday.
Tipuric asked whether the team had experienced a mental setback before the victory: “It’s hard to say.
These games are so balanced that maybe... people expect some kind of mental block to happen, I don't know.
At the end of the last match, we probably left around 15 points in the bois, so the final result looks much smaller than it actually was.
If Valia triumphs, then the battle of Tipurica with a favorite Australian duo from the third line of the mill by Michael Hooper and David Pocock will be of fundamental importance during arrest and defeat.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in representation colors and met with both contestants on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what awaits him.
"These are the players playing at the position of the seventh absolute world class," he said.
When it is played against the world class of third-line championships, it is always known that it will be a difficult match to play.
These two are always with the best racers in the world.
You know what games you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is more attacking seven and probably feels better as he is always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the best racers in the world and face challenges than to deal with a third line of lead, which is not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and when you're fighting these two, you must be in the top form.
I wouldn't say Sunday was almost the end of the Cup, but it's an important match for us in this World Cup.
Impet is an important element.
When we build strength and keep making great efforts, we will fly like on wings, and it will be hard to win.
Spoiler series EastEnders: Ben kisses Callum after sensational news from Whitney

Will this be the beginning of their relationship, or will they grieve at this moment of exile?
Since Callum helped save Ben's life, and then he supported Bobby Beale (Clay Milner Russell), they didn't rush with Ben, but they were considering going together on a date – Callum said last time to Ben that he was pleased to know his more sensitive and gentle faces.
Whitney's going to come back from her vacation tonight in a better mood than when she left.
It was good for her to leave Walford after their fatal marriage and discover that her future husband had betrayed her.
After he gets home, he's having a real conversation with Callum.
He's sending him a message that scares him.
Callum reacts badly to it and looks at the church in Queen Vic, who is dead by Jay Mitchell (James Borthwick).
Callum's drunk and full of emotion goes to Ben and blames him for everything that's happened.
Calm Ben understands his explosion and tries to comfort Callum, soon Callum's frustration turns into passion when a couple share a kiss.
How's that gonna work?
The couple's planning a date next week, but Ben's thinking about their relationship can put everything they've been working on so far.
Callum, who once again believed in himself after he opposed his homophobic father, is determined to fight for what he wants and what he deserves.
Watch the kiss in the series EastEnders on Friday 27 September at 20:30 on the BBC One channel.
The book's premiere.
"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Mlynarczyk
They were supposed to be the elite organization of the 'gentle races'.
They've adopted in their ranks those they've been guarding.
Can crime be more powerful than national identity?
We don't have another war or military book in our hands.
We are conducting a thorough international study on non-German participation in the Waffen-SS.
Historians from various European countries have analysed the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, recalled their activities and watched the recruitment process at different stages of the war.
Did the Danish departments differ from the French?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why couldn't a complex division of the Poles themselves be created?
What is the official historical narrative of cooperation in individual European countries today?
What happened to volunteers after the war ended?
Among other questions, the book "Waffen-SS" answers on the basis of solid research material.
We have sought to present a more subtle and more balanced image of cooperation in Europe during the second world war, also trying to break methodological boundaries of history and a given period of time by presenting the reports of the research authorities from different countries. (...) If the main casualties of this war - forced workers, Jews, Greeks, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slovenian population - are sometimes presented in comparative and/or supranational terms - so many factors are essentially investigated from the national perspective (if they do so).
"Total panic" when the White House is struggling to find arguments about impeachment
Officials from the White House are shocked to find out how to resist the repeated emphasis on impeachment on Thursday, and one of the speakers who are familiar with the situation describes the feeling of "total panic" felt last week because of the lack of a plan to respond to the new reality.
It seems that this reinforces "anxiety, uncertainty and fear" – one of the people associated with the White House describes the mood in the Western wing in this way – that the accusations of the informant can seriously harm the president and the people around him.
This person said, "There is no doubt that nothing is hidden there."
The White House officials were still uncertain how to proceed, not only because there is no clear plan of action in this situation, but also because the accusations are so serious that the standard methods of avoiding an effective conversation used by the President in the past may not work. "This does not seem to be something that is missing with the emergence of another cycle of news headlines," he joked.
Another person who is familiar with the debate described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of shock" accompanied by growing mistrust that along with the ongoing investigation into impeachment, the President would be more likely to respond irresponsiblely and become "hard to control".
This fear is shared by another speaker who claims that the President-in-Office expects that he will manifest more "stimulative" behaviour and the pressure exerted on him will certainly increase with each day of the investigation on impeachment.
This is causing concern that Trump may present more and more unpredictable behaviour and unexpectedly explode – this is in the context of the election year both from the presidency's point of view and elections.
Faced with the greatest threat to the presidency so far, Trump was turning from the attack to the defence, once again pursuing a strategy that he assessed as effective during Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia.
He tried to enrich his own request addressed to the Ukrainian President for help in investigating his political rivals in order to turn his attention and address it to the actions of democrats and candidates of Democrats Joe Biden and to discredit the informant as a leader of party initiatives.
But while many people in the White House are involved in the fight after Mueller's investigation, something has changed this time – counselors and consultants have said.
The President, whose badge is power, the mid-term press conference has shown as defeated – one of the people who are familiar with the situation has declared.
While Trump eagerly accepted questions about Russian investigation, he seemed unwilling to answer questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the president's allies believe that damage can be avoided, and some of them hold that the informant did not know from the first hand about the above-mentioned controversial telephone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Zelenski – which they consider to be unreliable.
And as often as the President is the object of the attack, the fact is that he is alive raised by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategies associated with the White House indicates that the results of the polls of support for the president are rather high, and impeachment will not have much impact on obtaining new sympathies.
"There is no need to focus on the President's impeachment in the next four months," especially if this makes his legislative programme difficult and prevails in a new cycle of news headlines.
Another speaker argues that those who maintained that impeachment would help the president did not finally understand how unforeseeable his reaction would be.
Concerned White House officials were looking for help from the advisors, completing the impeachment response team.
According to the person who knows about the plans, taking into account that these efforts are at an early stage, it is unclear whether any initiative in the style of the control centre will be taken and what form it can take.
This person stated that it is the belief that a coordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a determined leader capable of carrying out an attack on the PR in response to the publication of the food report by the signist and with a view to halting the spread of the actions of the democrats on the impeachment given by the disclosure of the report.
The speaker on the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly evident when the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Treasure Secretary Steve Munuchin stated that they did not intend to disclose the notes describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it could be felt that there was no exit and that the document should be published.
It is expected that the pressure will now be greater than during Robert Mueller's investigation, which mainly kept silence and spoke only through accusations. One of the people who could be involved in the preparation of the impeachment response is Corey Lewandowski, a man from the dirty work of Trump and was the head of the electoral staff – the person involved said.
However, Lewandowski said in a conversation with NBC News that it is not a true suggestion that he will lead this action.
"Over the past five years, I have done everything I can to support the president and his programme," he said, "but I have not taken part in any talks with the president or his team to join the team in order to resist a false statement about impeachment."
Private lawyer Donald Trump from Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, is also involved in impeachment.
"We are responding to cases as appropriate" – Sekulow answered when asked by NBC News for a comment.
Currently the White House feels the lack of an experienced lawyer in the field of impeachment, after as Emmet Flood, who worked at the impeachment of Clinton and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, left, and the current advisor, Pat Cipollone, does not have this type of experience.
The spokesperson for the White House's strategy stated that officials in general did not plan at any time to engage people or create a centre of command, but admitted that the need for a coordinated, joint response and people who could engage in political struggle.
Traveller Explorer of the Seas Royal Caribbean line passed repair for 89 million pounds
The explorer of the Seas, belonging to the Royal Caribbean International family, will set off this year on a journey, presenting a completely new look.
After being restored, which cost an impressive $110 million (89 million), the ship is delighted with a wide selection of culinary flavors from around the world and a rich offer of entertainment for the whole family.
This year, the Explorer will stop at the most wonderful ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to taste the taste of Mediterranean Europe.
When the adventure on the land ends, the crew of the ship promises to make an unforgettable impression on the sea.
Having a satisfactory offer for everyone, the Explorer, after renovating $110 million, or about $89 million, moved to a passenger ship providing a perfect entertainment for the entire family.
The impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board through advanced surfing simulators or watch a favorite family movie using the weather waves in the plenary cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addition of virtual balconies that allow passengers to admire the ocean views without having to go on board.
Water lovers will be delighted to be designed on a new board at the base of a Caribbean resort style with water park delights.
The pool surrounds the beach hammocks and beds ideal for sunsets, and two modernized sailors are in the hands of people who want powerful impressions on the board.
The attractive traveler for passengers of every age imposes the number of activities to be made available to guests during the trip to destination.
Made up of little Adventure Ocean for children, it is a chance for younger family members to remember beautiful memories, and the exclusive place to spend free time for teenagers offers a great game and a music area prepared for people over 12 years of age.
If this proves to be insufficient, the entire family may, in "Studio B" on the ship, target the laser tag with the effect of lighting in the dark, which can also be impressively served as an ice-cream to drive on the ladders.
During the trip to the Mediterranean, guests will also have the opportunity to experience exotic tastes from around the world, as they will be able to enjoy the excitement of the restaurants on board.
The modern Asian cuisine is offered on board a ship at the restaurant Izumi, and in the newly opened Giovanni's Italian Kitchen there is an amazing meal inspired by an innovative look at the traditional Italian cuisine.
The other gastronomic points on the board include an American restaurant offering Chops Grille steaks, Latin Bar Boleros, Schooner Bar and Johnny Rockets express bar.
Travel, with an option of seven or nine-day route, flows from Rome in May 2020.
As a second European ship belonging to the Royal Caribbean line, it will join the Allure of the Seas, which has recently passed an incredible repair.
After the 58-day Allure metamorphosis, a huge amount of $165 million, the tour operator offered guests who had previously booked, a voucher worth $300 to be issued on board the ship.
The tour operator said: “Explorer of the Seas is the fourth Voyager class ship, which will undergo a modernization of the Royal Amplified Fleet.”
The programme, which requires more than $1 billion of investment, comprising 10 ships and lasting four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of possibilities: from unrelenting attractions and gastronomic experiences to nightlife.
Devin Nunes accuses the Democrats of demanding "unscrupulous photos of Trump"
Congressman Devin Nunes from the state of California obviously cannot bear the clear truth that the case of President Donald Trump is under investigation.
In his Thursday defense, the President accused the Democrats of wanting to receive the President's naked photos.
Nunes, the high-ranking Republican in the Commission on the Information of the House of Representatives, called for this in the course of the preliminary statement during the hearing of the alarmist's complaint, as if Trump had turned to Ukraine for assistance in the initiation of an investigation against the candidate of the Democrats against President Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal a "gross presentation" of the left and their "medial axis", before stating that the Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in the neighborhood.
"The Democrats in this committee were negotiating with people who they thought were Ukrainians to get naked pictures of Trump," Nunes said.
"People can rightly ask why the Democrats are so determined to put the President in charge when they will have their chance in a year.
When Nunes ended up giving the recommendations, the political reporter of the HuffPost website, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats were really trying to... find out.
So far, only the Connecticut representative, Jim Hims, has responded, although we suspect that his answer is true, confirming the thoughts of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
Portal Mediaite.com suspects that the comments made by Nunes about the nuances refer to "certain more favourable and unconfirmed information", which are likely to appear in Steele's controversial documents,
It is celebrated, collected by former British spy Christopher Steele's collection of charges against Trump, indicating the likelihood of a tape that shows him at night watching the urine of a prostitute in the hotel room in Moscow.
Potential research on renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi Tesli have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to be the exclusion of renewable energy — aircraft.
However, Professor Albert University has developed a technology that will enable renewable biofuels to be used as aviation fuels.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta at the Department of Agriculture, Life and the Environment, which started work on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory develops hydrocarbons obtained from fatty wastes such as restaurant fat, animal fat and oil.
In contrast to ethanol and other biofuels, this technology may, in the course of production, benefit from oils of a lower quality, which is estimated to account for 85% lower carbon emissions than in the case of oil fuels, and also for waste from other industries.
This technology is intended to imitate hydrocarbons present in oil fuels.
"What our technology did in the first generation," said Bressler, "is [in total] hydrocarbons that are identical particles as in diesel."
While this opens up a new possibility for biofuel use, previously developed biofuel products have been prone to destabilization at lower temperatures, which in the case of aircraft flying at high altitudes has been a serious threat.
"The problem with aviation fuel is a bit of a wrong cycle," said Bressler.
It's really less worth than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
The Bressler Laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aviation biofuels.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional treatment of hydrocarbons and the addition of hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on partially developed chemical properties that provide fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," Bressler said, commenting on another option.
This option is more risky.
The company created by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working on product commercialization, as airlines, as well as the Canadian and American armies are increasing investment in a renewable option.
"They are able to imagine the times in which the situation may be reversed and the carbon tax will be imposed on them," he said.
They want this alternative, which will be an emergency plan.
Forge is currently operating a pilot plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Centre and has recently received a sum of $4 million from Lockheed Martin in the investment to support the cost of $25 million in the construction of a manufacturing plant, which will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
It is expected that the plant will produce about 19 million litres of biofuels annually.
Bressler also notes that the planned carbon reduction will amount to about 85 per cent, but issues such as transport and fuel production stop further carbon reduction.
“As a technology specialist,” said Bressler –
I have the task of developing options that allow conscious decisions and many choices."
COVER: Another cheating on a granddaughter
8 thousand zł and 750 euro lost the property of Zamśća, thinking that it helped his grandson, who caused the accident.
The police informed him of the incident on Thursday, the son of a cheated employee.
“He called the woman in the middle of the man who gave up for her grandson.
He said he had an accident and needed money.
Otherwise he'll go to jail.
The senior wanted to help her grandson, she handed 8 thousand dollars and 750 euros to a false policeman who came to her house," says Asp. Dorota Krukowski-Bubilo from the foreign police.
Officers are looking for agents, and again they appeal for caution:
"Every phone with a request for financial assistance must be verified.
Do not act under the influence of emotion or in a hurry.
Let's remember that cops don't ask for money and don't accept money.
If we get a phone call asking for financial support that will stimulate our suspicions, we need to respond immediately and notify the police by calling the alarm number 112.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about threats, let's let them know how fraud works.
Please be careful and don't trust people who call and ask for a loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's allies warn that when Britain's Brexit is lifted, such as in Los Angeles, there are threats to peace, and he himself calls for peace.
One of the top cabinet ministers said last night that the country was threatened with "a violent social breakdown", if the original result was questioned by the result of the second referendum.
The British Prime Minister's allies from his immediate surroundings warned that the country was threatened with social unrest on the scale of the protests of "yellow shirts" in France due to social inequality and confusion in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for "satisfaction of moods" during a stormy political struggle, but stressed that he would not stop using the word "offering".
Despite his calling for a peaceful cabinet minister, "The Times" said: "In this country there have never been protests such as demonstrations of "gilets young" ("yellow shirts") or residents of Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because they didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – young gilets – using encrypted phones that can coordinate pickets, and to push people into protest is enough for a few unwelcome populist leaders.
The residents of Los Angeles exploded after a lion of swearing indicted four white policemen who killed a black cab driver Rodney King in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow light-tight shirts – young gilet – have been deserting and ravaging the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The Minister referred to the warning issued by Johnson in the Gmin Chamber and said that if Britain fails to leave the EU, there will be "a catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we organize a referendum in which 30 million people vote, 66% of them will talk about the rest of Britain in the European Union, and will not be satisfied with ten million citizens," said the Minister.
Even if such a result ignores 99% of them, then we'll have 100,000 angry people who will write to their mail and who won't forgive.
Many do not need to see a few and a half thousand people on the street soon.
One of the top cabinet ministers added that the country was threatened with "a violent social breakdown", if the result of the first referendum was questioned by the result of the second.
Johnson called for the organisation of general elections in which voters would have to decide on the brexit lot.
According to the report, the Prime Minister is facing the risk of a cabinet rebel that wants to reduce requests for Brexit and achieve a compromise agreement with the EU.
The capital, the Czubovna and the Krosny were delighted in Kraków.
Follow us Talk'N"Roll
More than 300 participants listened on Thursday (September 26th) 11 inspiring performances of lecturers, among whom were Szymon Holovnia, Krystyna Czubovna or Ireneusz Krosny.
It's all at the Talk'N'Roll conference, which took place in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Enlargement of the horizons, discussions on the policies of the public and joint discussions that can be a driving force for further development.
These goals were set by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 exceptional speakers, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, and among them among other people known from the media - Shimona Holovny, Christina Chubovna and Irene Krosno.
The theme of this year's Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the Future, NOW" and just around the creation of the future focused on the presence of guests invited to participate in the conference.
The first session was opened by the director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who told us how the brand that is being built around him may have an impact on our future.
Richard Lucas went on the stage to change the public's perception of the phenomenon of rejection, claiming that they should be accepted if the future is to be created, Chris Badura took on the issue of empathy in the process of brilliant technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) has been divided into observations and techniques that can help manage careers and increase overall satisfaction by finding an appropriate balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multifaceted discussion with Kristina Chubovna, who told among other things about how her perspective on space changed the lecturer’s profession in Poland.
The holder of one of the most popular votes in the country has admitted that, thanks to development technology, everyone today can make this profession difficult.
However, he does not believe that, in the near future, a person in the position of a lecturer is completely replaced by technology.
After her, Piotr Nabelec took up the problem of life in times of overload of information, emotional or overload of choice, giving the public valuable clues of how to deal with it, and Lukas Lętocha, in his speech, spoke of what another industrial revolution, known as "Industry 4.0" could lead to.
Learning fun, learning fun
The conference organizers also took note of the artistic impressions, inviting the illusionist Daniel Jedinak to the scene.
The third part of the conference opened up Irenaeus Krosny, who first played the public pantonium, and then, for example, on his own career, told how he was trying to maintain the right balance between his career on stage and his private life.
The participants also took their stand, stressing, above all, the role of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that even two minutes can diametrically change the situation and need to be ready to use this time.
Moreover, Holovnia shared her thoughts about the reality surrounding us, calling for anecdotes that could cause smiles on the faces of the eyes.
Then Adrian Kworuszka appeared on the scene, which reviewed the history and objectives of several innovation models and referred them to how they are currently being used.
At the end of Marcin Sloviak, for example, Rubika, spoke of an approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 predecessors has certainly brought something new to see the reality of all those who have had the opportunity to watch the events, and the food reactions and numerous questions to the guest give evidence of a great commitment from the public.
The organizers provided a broadcast for all who could not personally participate in the event, and the recordings from the lecture are available on the website.
The rule of law instead of the rule of law.
"In spite of the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority introduced a number of changes to the state system, creating threats to the rule of law and the principle of the triple power," the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, published on Thursday.
The report 'The rule of law instead of the rule of law' documents, inter alia, changes in the degree of justice and in the field of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published on Thursday a report entitled “The rule of law instead of the rule of law.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland between 2015 and 2019".
The Foundation assesses in the report that in 2015-2019 the largest return on human rights in Poland has been recorded since 1989.
"In spite of the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority introduced a number of changes to the state system, creating threats to the rule of law and the principle of the triading of power.
By applying the right to political purposes, the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of law," HFPC experts say.
What about the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as the public media or the Ombudsman) and in the field of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT rights and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarizes the three-year dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
"In the last four years, for the first time and on this scale, we have observed the use of the right to exercise the partial interests of the parties.
This has led to a ongoing legal crisis, as well as a weakening of the entire human rights system in Poland," said lawyer Marcin Volny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years are "the period of systemic change both in the country" and "in the field of the protection of human rights".
Over the past four years, Sejm has adopted more than 20 key legal acts in terms of human rights protection.
"The changes have often been adopted at a rapid pace, without social consultation and despite the reservations of the legal environment, the Ombudsman or international organisations," said legal lawyer Malgorzat Suleka, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the past four years are: "weakening independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), non-compliance with binding judgments and recommendations of international institutions, and weakening guarantees for the protection of human rights".
State authorities did not respond
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs, which is particularly concerned, considered "the situations in which state authorities have not reacted or simply considered the occurrence of aggression".
The Foundation’s experts noted that some changes have been made to the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups affected by discrimination.
The Foundation indicates that the result of the State's activities in the field of the limitation of the rule of law is a persistent dispute between the Polish authorities with the European Union and a number of recommendations by international law actors.
"The lack of implementation of these recommendations not only weakens Poland's position as the leader of democratic change in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, but also affects Poland's responsibility for violations of European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights," we read in the report.
Brother of Pakistani social media star with life for honour killing
Women's rights experts claim that the investigation of justice is often difficult because of the ongoing proceedings, the release of suspects for bail and the involvement of the public.
"It takes so long for people to forget," says Farzana Bari, the defender of women's rights and the first founder of the gender study department in Pakistan, and adds that even the widespread issue of Baloch's murder has been resolved for more than three years.
Although the women's rights groups find it difficult to determine, the Pakistani Human Rights Commission in 2018 found at least 300 cases of so-called honour killings.
Many activists claim that the real number is much higher, and the network promoting awareness of crimes of honorary motives estimates that there are about one fifth of the 5,000 honour killings committed each year worldwide in Pakistan.
Polakak’s profits abroad
However, transfers to the country are small, because many immigrants are staying outside Poland on a regular basis – it gives the Friday "Rzeczpospolita".
The latest Euro-Tax report shows that Poland’s average earnings in other European countries amounted to more than 8,6 thousand zł in 2018, which means they have raised almost a thousand gold, or almost 12%.
Euro-Tax "estimates that total income of Polish migrant workers in the countries of the Union reached a record value of $154.5 billion in 2018, one seventh more than a year earlier", we read.
Director of the Centre for Migration Research at the University of Warsaw, Pavel Kaczmarczyk, says that Poles are increasingly working on the international labour market where they make use of various available options.
"There are also increasing numbers of specialists and professionals who are moving from country to country, like international corporations," the newspaper said.
Some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries during the year, such as the United Kingdom and Germany.
“This is the most important in the RFN in 2018, because 11% of total Polish immigrants’ earnings increased (up to €27 billion).
However, the Polish have earned the most on the island – almost 35 billion zł", we read on.
The President of Euro-Taxu believes that despite the improvement of working conditions on the Polish market, the number of migrant workers does not decrease.
In the West and Northern Europe (on the front with Norway), it is often a chance for several times more profits than in Poland.
"This is even at minimum rates in a given country, which, for example, in Germany is EUR 9,5-11,7 per hour," the newspaper reports.
"Rzeczpolita" indicates that Poland remains not only because of higher earnings, but also because they have become home abroad.
Many Poles leave their roots abroad, as can be seen from the small transfers of money to the country.
Those last year were the lowest.
As economist Tadeusz Krštýcki reminds us, along with the extension of the stay abroad, a small group of people who transfer money to the country and reduce their height.
"Emigrants are getting close," we read in Friday's "Rzeczpospolite".
Prolonged monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extending for almost a month, and undetected rainfall causes death as a result of the construction of buildings and the destruction of many crops.
In northern India, monsoons usually drop early in September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded the standard by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the most ending monsoon of decades.
In many areas of the country, rainfalls are still undetectable – in recent times in western India, the cities of Pune in the middle and quarter of the rainy rains have led to the deaths of several dozen people and the launch of the collapse of buildings.
There's been a raid on the houses, people ran through the streets in the water on their knees, which is usually only taking place during the apogeum monsoon.
Heavy rains also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Luknow and Hajdarabad.
As a result of long-lasting rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many houses were destroyed.
Monsun also started late.
In many areas there was no water, so farmers prepared for the likely drought.
The long-lasting monsoon is not well seen by farmers.
This amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year.
"By him my vegetables – and now I have a pulp, beans, game and tomatoes – will be destroyed," says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the late effects and the late end of the monsoon mean a rise in the price of the onions, i.e. the essential ingredient of Indian foods.
The Cebula, which usually had to pay 20 rupees (0.23 pounds of British) currently costs 80 rupees (about 1 pounds of British) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Bombay.
Feasts and holidays are also under threat.
Another great festival is the 8th of October of Dasar's festival, during which Hindus raise huge bells as from a comic, representing Ravana, to be made with a bubbling nose and a cruel smile from the epoch "Ramayana".
Ravany's burning symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that Ravany's similar was made of paper, if the monsoon continues, then Ravan will laugh the last.
Implementation of the Energy Synergies Technology Sp. z o.o. share sale agreement in restructuring
On 27 September 2019, the Bank account of the Fund received a price of 26,843 shares in Energosynergia Technology Sp. z o.o. in restructuring amounting to €100,000.
The same ownership of these shares was transferred to the INDOS S.A. headquarters in Chorz.
The sale of shares agreement was implemented in connection with the rejection of the other shareholders from the right to acquire shares and as a result of the expression of consent to the remainder of the shareholders to whom such an authorisation was granted.

Doodle celebrates 21 Google birthdays
It would be hard to imagine a world today without Google.
In the search engine, we're looking for answers to all the intriguing questions.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "How?" are one of the favorite categories sought by the Poles.
The giant data shows that last year we were willing to ask, among other things, about "Where is the storm?", "How to make spaghetti?" and "How many fingers has a horse?", "How to get rid of a fruit muscle?", "How to eat cocoa?".
Today the search engine is about the 20th birthday.
Its users – and up to 96% of people in Poland are using "Google uncle" – welcome today to Google Doodle.
It's not animated this time.
Google recalls its birthdays, showing a stationary computer with monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the right, bottom corner, a digital date is printed – as in a picture from the age of 90.
Information catalogue
The searcher was created for a specific purpose – to catalogue all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Her name is a word-playing game.
It comes from the mathematical term Gogol, which means the number of ten raised to the power of a hundred.
This name should also reflect the company's intention to index as many websites as possible from global Internet resources.
The Google search engine was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which worked better than the normal segregation of the results on the basis of the frequency of the phrase.
At the beginning, the search engine was named BlackRub, which refers to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linked to the result.
Page and Brin set up a company under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon they launched the famous website google.com.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, the "PC Magazine" will show up information about the extremely high frequency of Google search results.
Then the company's history looks almost like a fairy tale - brilliant development with every month, boosting other markets and increasing the value of the company.
Already in June 2000 the Google URL index has more than billions of locations, making Page and Brina the world's largest search engine.
Currently the company founded by Page and Brina is one of the leading players on the IT market.
So is there any other field for development?
"The Google mission is the organisation of global information resources to be widely available and useful, although we have made huge progress in this area, it is still a very long way ahead of us to achieve this goal," said Piotr Zalevski from Google Poland.
Common contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
The new study suggests that work with a high level of exposure to plant protection products may lead to a high risk of heart failure in later years of life.
This happened in the case of a group of Japanese-born Americans in Hawaii who have been studied for more than 30 years.
Scientists have found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45% more affected by heart disease or stroke.
"This study underlines the need to use personal protective equipment during contact with pesticides at work and the importance of recording in medical documentation contact with such agents at work, as well as the control of standard factors that increase heart failure," said researcher Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez.
She's a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in the Manoa District.
The results are based on data from more than 6,000 men on the island of Oahu who took part in the cardiology program of Kuakini Honolulu.
As scientists have pointed out, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations because it was only for men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life of breakdown, so their effects on health may reveal themselves many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years after contact with plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez reported: “After 34 years of male observation, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant. ”
It was probably because more important factors were associated with aging, which masked possible causal relationships between exposure to contact with pesticides and susceptibility to the circulation system in later years.
Researchers have not found a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and an increase in the risk of heart disease or stroke.
Zeljenski-Trup phone call: Porozenko delivers his three coins
Washington's policy is taking place for a stormy week in connection with the impeachment procedure against US President Donald Trump
Getting used to a political scandal is for the political debutant of Wolodymyr Zelenski's situation that he would like to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zelenski-Trump affair, and will it have far-reaching effects for the first of them?
Almost at the start of Trump's phone call, he told Zejlenski that the United States is doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes revealed by the White House are not complete, the Trump attack on Chancellor Angela Merkel is described in detail as being that the German leaders, together with other leaders of European countries, engage in negotiations instead of presenting concrete proposals.
The controversy sparked a response from the Greens, which announced that it was consistent with Trump not 100%, but 1000%.
Zelenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are insufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views led politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, to decide to vote through social services.
Petro Porozenko, former president of Ukraine, said on Twitter that the EU's support "was unprecedented".
In other tweets, Porozenko said he was grateful for the EU's support during the "Russian aggression", which included sanctions and financial aid.
Others expressed their concerns, including Ukrainian politicians Victoria Voytsitska announced: "How can we talk to Germany and France now?"
Trump then referred to military aid and asked Zejenski for investigation not in one, but in two cases: the first concerning Joe Biden’s son – Hunter – and the second concerning the entry into the DNA server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacker attack on the Democratic e-mail boxes during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether it describes European relations, or whether relations with the French and German leaders will be broken.
I don't want to talk bad about anyone...
We thank all those who are helping us" – he said after publishing a record of the telephone conversation in New York during the UN General Assembly.
Zeljenski is to meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the forthcoming “Nordic four” summit, which is to take place in October.
Former Voyage Inspector Legally Imprisoned
The court has cleared Jerzy Visnievsky of his crimes.
After six years Jerzy Wisniewski was finally cleared of charges.
The District Court of Industry has cleared Jerzy Visniewski, the former head of the Trade Quality Inspectorate of Részów's Food and Agriculture Members, from the charge of exceeding the powers.
The Lubelian prosecutor accused him of betraying the mayor's office at the time of the inspection of the food oil plant.
He has recently come to the issue of a judicial verdict.
The appeal was recognised on 12 September.
"The court maintained the defendant's judgment," confirmed Judge Malgorzata Reiser, the spokesperson of the District Court of Industry.
It is a judgment of 14 February, issued by the Regional Court of Industry.
Jerzy Wisniewski then commented on Facebook: “It has been six years since I was presented by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin accused of allegedly breaking the law in a telephone conversation with the Mayor of Podkarpacki on 30 April 2012.
The court clearly stated that I was innocent and that I did not break the existing law.
I was convinced that my phone conversation back then with the Marshall of Podkarpack was in line with the current law.
The version of the events published in 2013 by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Lublina was mixed with the truth and caused irreversibly damage to both the food producer's business and the loss of my person's image in my employers, among employees and in the local community.
The indictment brought against me in the opinion of the Court contained a number of errors, false facts, inaccurate definitions of the legal basis, which were not actually confirmed.
With the help of the CBA in Reese, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
I was immediately released from work and deprived of financial resources.
I've been leaving for a long time to keep my wife."
Let's remember.
Jerzy Wisniewski served as the voivodship inspector of the commercial quality of agricultural and food products between 2009 and 2013.
He was dismissed from office after the prosecutor's office in Lublin filed charges in 2013.
According to the investigators, he was about to betray the then Marshallian voivodeship in a telephone conversation (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years of freedom) for the time of checking in the establishment producing food oil belonging to the wife of the then Vice-Martial Sub-Carpack.
This warning, as prosecutors from Lublin claimed, was to cause the company's owner to know about the controls and correct labels on oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wisniewski heard allegations of a violation of his rights, which threatened him to be released for up to three years.
“I am relieved that this case has finally reached an end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I had done nothing wrong, which is now the final confirmation of a legitimate sentence that deplores my accusations," says Jerzy Wisniewski.
The White House tried to hide the conversation with Zelenski
In a Thursday edited report, the alarmist wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Zejenski, was seeking foreign interference in the US elections, and the White House was trying to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the United States
In an anonymous report dated 12 August, a signalist who is probably an intelligence worker, he wrote: “As part of my duties, I have been informed by many members of the American government that the president has used his role to demand foreign interference in the 2020 elections in the United States.”
“The troupe used part of the conversation (with Zeljenski) to realize its own interests.
And precisely – he tried to press on the Ukrainian leader to take steps to help the president in the re-election in 2020," the report quoted by The Hill.
The Ukrainian leader was "given to understand" that contacts with Trump depend on whether he will "show the will to take up the game" in matters about which he was to be informed more precisely by the lawyer of President Rudy Giuliani.
The author admits that he was not a witness to the conversation, but points out that he was informed in detail about its content by “many White House officials who had direct information on this matter”, and their relations were covered.
“In the days following this conversation, I learned from many U.S. officials that the high rankings of representatives of the White House intervened to “stop” all archived records of this conversation, and in particular the verbatim record that has been prepared, as is usually done, in the crisis peace of the White House”, we read further.
"A high-ranking White House officials told me that White House lawyers "ordered them to remove electronic records from the information system in which such records are stored.
The entry was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate particular confidential information," wrote the author of the report.
"In my assessment, these steps show that the White House officials were aware of what happened during the conversation," said the alarmist.
As the AP notes, this document will probably speed up the proceedings on the President's possible impeachment and also contains valuable information on witnesses who can confirm this report.
The Green White House's interview was made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of relations between the people who were witnesses to it.
The content of the report, in an edited version, was published on the day following the hearing of the House of Representatives.
Also on Thursday, the Director of American Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the Committee of Inquiry of the House of Representatives and provided explanations on how the employee's report was being dealt with.
Maguire said that the signaler made the right choice and did what the law says.
He also stressed that he felt that the conversation with Greenland was an event "without precedent".
The Democrats in the Committee of Inquiry asked Maguire why he blocked the presentation of the alarmist report to Congress; the Director of Intelligence denied that he had no right to disclose its content, which is a confidential guarantee of the so-called privilege of the executive authority.
A part of Maguire's hearing by the committee was held behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, informed that, in view of the suspicion that the President had put pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential elections, the House of Representatives launched an investigation that could lead to the impeachment of Trump.
The day later, she assessed that the report of Trump's talks with the Greens confirmed that the President of the United States had violated the electoral and security standards.
Election rights in the United States prohibit the use of foreign aid.
However, the Justice Resort assessed that the President did not break the electoral law. On Thursday, the spokesperson of the White House, Stephanie Grisham, said that there was "nothing wrong" in the conversation, and in the report "there is nothing more than a collection of relations from the third hand and a series of press releases".
"The White House will continue to criticise this hysteria of the media and the false narrative promoted by the mainstream media," she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) meeting in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded in evidence that Ghana achieved the highest number of aviation safety oversight points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 per cent in the area of the actual implementation rate (EI).
This occurred when ICAO completed its ICVM control on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Aviation Agency Safety Audit Programme.
The award in the field of protection was evidence of recognition of the country's high commitment to the implementation of ICAO's standards and protection protocols at airports and in Ghana's airspace.
The award programme has been developed to support the ICAO initiative No Country Left Behind.
In addition, 16 other safety certificates and 17 other safety certificates have been granted to ICAO Member States which have improved their safety and safety standards.
At the time of the award for Ghana the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of Ghana Civil Aviation Office, Simon Allotey, Ambassador Ghana in Canada, No Ayikoi Otoo and Director Managing Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa were present.
In his speech, President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuywiwa Benard Aliu, stressed the need to maintain safety in the airspace of the Member States.
He said "it is important that we constantly remind ourselves that even in the era of innovation, the safety of aviation protection and sustainable development must remain our basic priorities".
For his part, Mr Adda noted that the awards were a huge achievement for the state's efforts because they complement hard work and industry sustainability.
He also added that the aviation industry has enormous potential for the development of the country's economy, saying that "aircraft has the potential to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but everything comes from the security and protection that we have managed to achieve."

Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as Head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, who serves as the Administrator of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), smiles when he attends the meeting of the National Budget Security Sub-Commission on the FEMA's proposal for the financial year 2020 at the Capitol Mountain in Washington, U.S.A., on 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that on Thursday US President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, Deputy Administrator of FEMA, is the head of the agency that oversees the government response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The Agency worked without an administrator approved by the American Senate since March when Brock Long dismissed the position.
Long resigned after the U.S. Department of State Security under FEMA stated that Long was improperly using government vehicles for traffic between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month when a thorough examination of his past revealed charges that he was involved in the fight at the bar.
Gaynor's appointment was expected.
In order to approve his appointment to this role, a majority will be required in the Senate.
The White House announced that before Gaynor became FEMA's deputy administrator in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served at sea level.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, considering amputation
The 28-year-old runner specializes in the distance of 1500 meters, winning the gold medal of the European Championships in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and bronze in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the Vice-President of Europe for 5,000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that it was not a new duty and that one operation had already passed immediately after the games in 2016, but the pain had returned and was very violent in the current season.
The pain causes me to take a step that changes my body’s order, other unnatural burdens, and begin to feel pain in other places, such as the biodegradation.
That's why I couldn't get ready enough for the world's championships, and the pain has been so strong for two weeks that I've been having trouble setting my wheels – the runner said on the NRK television channel antenna.
The father and coach, Gert Ingebrigtsen, admitted that after long discussions with his son, they concluded that the only solution to not finish his career and participate in future Olympics in Tokyo would be amputation.
It looks like it's the only one, although the drastic solution and decision have already come down.
"If part of the body is in pain, it should be removed, and in fact Henrik does not so much need this finger and in this situation it should be forgotten about the cosmetic aspect," he explained.
Police close illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the valley of San Gabriel – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday the police closed the illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the valley of San Gabriel.
At an office building located at 9600 Telstar Avenue about 16:37, a raid was made, where police were looking for illegal cigarettes containing marijuana and where large layers containing butane hashish oil were found – concentrate from Indian cannabis.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police, the officers also found a device used to supplement steaming contributions.
"This process is very dangerous," says Cano.
Cano, who used to work on drugs, says that the distillation of oil used in vampire products is a potentially easy-to-burn process.
"A simple electrostatic spark of our clothing can cause the flame of these resistors not only causing fire, but also due to concentration, even explosions," he says.
“If we have many layers and similar ones in the room, another explosion will occur after one explosion, causing not only fire, but also explosions that could get out of the surface of the whole complex.
The Bureau was called upon to carry out special tasks to deal with illegal and potentially hazardous substances.
The value of confiscated products and equipment is currently unknown.
The detectives say that they received an anonymous guide that allowed them to obtain a search warrant, which led to the discovery of illegal activity.
The investigators are still trying to get information about who's behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person in charge took an interest in the place because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and officials want to be sure that illegal products have not reached the street, taking into account recent articles on the harmful effects of smoking.
"People really don't know what products they buy," says Cano.
“They can be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This may pose a threat to our society and to our children, so we always keep them from reaching for this kind of thing.
Aphtin was withdrawn from the market.
GIF has decided that the medicine should be given to the spleen
The Chief Inspectorate for Medicinal Products has been informed of the withdrawal of the medicinal product from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used in the treatment of fungal fungal infections and fungal infections, infections with Gram-additional bacteria.
It can also be used as an aid in the treatment of infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product was withdrawn because it was not in accordance with the requirements for the quality specification of the smell of the product and the decrease in the content of the active substance.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galenium Laboratory in Olsztina.
Each month the GIF shall issue an average of several decisions on the withdrawal of each series of products from the market.
The series of medicinal products for human use in Poland may be re-introduced on the market after evidence of safety has been provided.
There is no such possibility of withdrawal.
Banknote 19 zł – where to buy a collection banknote about this nominal?
He bears 19 gold and shows on it the image of Ignace Jan Paderowski.
At the beginning of October, a new collection banknote will be introduced – the National Bank of Poland reported.
This is another note from the series "Individuality".
He will remember the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Polish Securities Manufacturer.
As stated in the NBP Communication, Ignacy Jan Paderowski will be presented on the banknote.
The date on the banknote, 25 January 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the PWPW takes place.
Also the nominal value, 19 zł, refers to the Year of Creation" - we read in the NBP Communication.
The watermark shall present an eagle image from the first Polish banknote produced in PWPW after recovery of independence.
The news is a holographic bar located on the window on the floor.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignace Jan Paderowski, and a picture of the Order of the White Eagle has been presented in addition to the inscription “not laid down”.
This inscription, reflected in the handwriting of Joseph Pilsudski, is a 100-year-old trade logo of recovery by Poland.
In the gullet of Wavrin, symbolizing brotherhood and victory, the security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of angle effect, was composed.
On the reverse banknote page is placed the image of the Gmach Manufacturer on the background of modern Warsaw.
Next to it is built into the PWPW logo SPARK Live security and the eyelid, also visible in UV light in the form of repeated numbers "19" and "NBP" - describes NBP.
The banknote is due to go into circulation on October 2, with up to 55,000 pieces.
One banknote will cost 80 gold.
All currencies and banknotes issued by NBP, including those from the special series, are the legal means of payment in Poland.
However, their nominal value is significantly higher than that which can be achieved on the collection market.
The new owner bought it for $500 thousand, or more than two million gold, for his parents and decided to transfer the building to Queenstown in Maryland.
The house was transferred to a special platform to the port of Easton where it was loaded onto the boat.
That's where he crossed a 50-mile river.
Jarosław Kaczynski votes for Malgorzata Gosiewski
President of PiS Jarosław Kaczynski will vote in the upcoming elections on the Malgorzata Gosiewska.
"Please do the same," he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczynski and Malgorzata Gosiewska invited PiS to take a photo of the banner candidate.
On Friday, the Warsaw "three" praised in the social media that it had won Kaczynski's vote in parliamentary elections.
"The President of Law and Justice Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczinski supports Malgorzata Gosiewska," we read on her Facebook profile.
The party leader noted that he was a sensitive, sensitive person and always ready to carry help.
"I shall give my vote to Malgorzat Gosiewska and ask for the same," he appealed.
Gosiewska is a candidate for Sejm from County 19. (Warszawa) and third place on the list.
"One" is Kaczynski alone, and the other is Mariusz Kaminski.
The Christmas Book Fairs are coming.
Before we meet with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
"We're here to break stereotypes.
The people of Podcarpathia are said not to read the books.
We'll show that it's different," she said at a press conference on March 30th.
And who will support the reading of the Reese this year?
As we have heard, Sister Anastasia will appear on the fairs, who will be called the first chef of the river Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrovska and Jakub Čwiek.
This autumn in the Millennium Hall will be a major cultural event – November 22 and 23, to the shopping centre, the 3rd edition of the Sacred Book Fairs, which is one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting publishing and accounting offices from all over Poland will be on the market.
There will be up to 30 of them, and among them will be Agora, Mark, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their positions, they will present their wide range of publishing offers and hundreds of new booksellers who will be able to buy at attractive prices.
Moreover, special meetings with writers will be held during two days of trade.
This time, authors who write about important things and are not afraid to take on difficult topics are invited, and they are also prize winners and... they're great at cooking.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At this point, the participants confirmed, among other things, Lukasz Orbitowski – the winner of the political passport, Janusz Leon Wisniewski, the best-selling author of "Isolation in the Network", and the king himself of the Polish crime: Katarzyna Bonda.
The star of this year's fairs will be Anastasia's sister, author of several books (including cooking) that sold in over 4 million copies.
The exhibition of the missing Elżbiety I dress in the Hampton Court Palace
The silver thread made of the most remarkable silken camel has been artificially decorated by the traps representing vegetation, animals and motillas.
For Eleri Lynn, the curator of the Historic Royal Palaces exhibition, it meant only one thing.
The blue cloth hanging for 100 years on the wall of the small rural parish church that she was looking at could only be lost in the Elizabeth I wardrobe.
Three years after Lynn caught up with the case of an altar cloth exhibition in Bacton in the County of Herefordshire, the missing Elżbiety dress is due to hit the exhibition next month at the Hampton Court Palace, near the same premises where a queen from the Tudor dynasty could wear it more than 450 years ago.
The measure of the importance of this discovery is that from the entire collection of royal skirts there was only one element of 16th-century skirt.
Although there is no compelling evidence that Elizabeth ever wore that dress, three years of research strengthened the experts to believe that she must have been part of the royal wardrobe.
"Srebrogłów", incredibly the way of tissue, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuoso quality of the arrested plants and flowers, later enriched by deer, dogs, motillas, fish and bears, indicates that the garment belonged to the most significant of the persons.
The dress, when it was sewn, could cost the equivalent of Tudor's possession.
"More than that, in the 1990s, 16th century, when Elizabeth was ruling, she felt threatened by other women in the court and would not tolerate rivals wearing such durable fabrics," Lynn says.
"As this is a very important statement, I have asked many people from the environment to look at their dress.
It really made me very happy to see the dress, they also admired it, and they were practically convinced that we had an element of the royal wardrobe before us.
Long, life-long dresses, cut to serve as an altar cloth in the dark church of St. Faith in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is a settlement from which Blanche Parry, the nearest Elizabeth lady of the court who has served the queen for her long life and with which the local legends identify the actual fabric.
Although the dress was born after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elżbieta had to give it to the Parry family or parishes to the Blanche memory before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservatory work, four of which came on the most delicate hand-cuffs using specially colored jade and thin surgical needles, the altar fabric hit the exhibition next to the Hatfield House’s portrait “Rainbow Portrait”, one of the most famous images of Elżbieta dressed in a similar dress.
"During the work with historical fabrics, the art of the people who performed them is truly becoming respected," says Libby Thompson, head of conservation work, most of which took place in the glass cellar for this purpose in the Hampton Court Palace – the only place enough to accommodate some of the priceless palace gobelins.
“Looking back and forth at the prison, I began to feel great respect for those who had made it.
I've never worked on something so elitist.
The "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" exhibition will begin on 12 October in the Hampton Court Palace
Fitch confirmed Poland's rating with a stable outlook
Fitch confirmed Poland's long-term rating in foreign currency on Friday at "A-" – given in the communication.
The outlook for the rating remained stable.
"Fitch points to strong macroeconomic foundations and a well diversified economy, which is supported by a sound economic policy and a strong banking sector," we read in the Communication of the Ministry of Finance.
As added, Fitch noted that Poland was at the top of the economic cycle, and in 2019-2021 the real rate of growth of the Gross National Product in Poland will be 4.1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent, respectively.
The Agency predicts that the government and self-government deficit for GDP will remain below 3% in 2020-2021, 2.3% and 1.9% respectively.
"The debt ratio of the government and self-government sector to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 per cent according to the agency and will be lower (average 48.3 per cent in the period 2020-2021) in subsequent years", we read.
Polish rating
The autumn round of Poland's 11 October ratings will end S&P and Moody's.
The rating of Poland in Fitch's assessment remains the same as it was issued at the end of March 2019.
The agency then confirmed Poland's rating at "A-" with a stable perspective.
Among the three largest credit rating agencies, Poland is the highest rated credit rating of Moody's – at A2 level.
The rating of Poland according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level below Moody's.
The prospects of all assessments are stable.
What's a rating?
The credit rating agencies are set up to assist investors in assessing the risk scale of their investment activities.
The rating is granted to companies, banks and countries.
In the latter case, each assessment shall be translated into economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing but a credit rating.
On its basis, decisions are made about who and how much money to borrow.
Sometimes such information also suggests that the best thing to do is not give credit because there is a high risk that money will not be recovered.
The lower rating is linked to a higher risk.
In turn, higher risk is high interest on credit.
Any assessment must be justified and reasoned.
Ratings can be manipulated, but in such a case, agencies risk losing their reputation.
More than 90 per cent of the world rating service market currently controls three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them uses its own assessment system.
"Fifth Confederation": After the first 1000 plus
"Friday of the Confederation", that is, the main foundations of the electoral programme, presented candidates for the Sejm district 40 in Kosovo on Friday, applying for the mandate of the KW Confederation of Freedom and Independence list.
The leader of the Koszalinian list to Sejm Krzysztof Chmielewski presented the password "Fridays of the Confederation".
"After the first 1000 plus programme for Poland, after the second fast and fair courts, after the third cultural and educational bonus, after the fourth national security, after the fifth it is a healthy life," Chmielewski said.
He noted that "Poland must finally start making a decent start," so the Confederation wants to eliminate the income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the problem with the tax-free amount itself will be solved".
"The Poles need to make a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and voluntary ZUS for all," said the leader of the list on the "1000 plus programme for Poland".
On the other hand, Alexandra Zadenck, starting from the second place of the list, referred to the program password "health life" said that "life is getting worse quality" and to change this, "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture" should work for GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederation also refers to the cessation of "stigmatization of seed hemp".
Zadencka declared the Confederation's support for "the development of construction using natural raw materials".
She also spoke on behalf of her group for "voluntary vaccinations".
"There can be no breach of the right to conscious consent," she added.
Other candidates for the Sejm from the Koszalinian District stressed that the Confederation is behind "the conduct of a profound reform of the judiciary", which would include the consideration of the case by the judge "day after day".
They also argued that the education grant was to be made to schools without the help of governments, i.e., according to them, without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The Confederation is also a "strong Polish army based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The candidates for the Sejm stressed the need to increase the number of troops.
They also see the need for easier access to weapons.
In economic matters, they stressed the need for "permanent access to energy".
"We can gasify coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy complexes, we also need to consider going back to the idea of atomic power," said fifth on the electoral list Piotr Karpinski.
Mexico's cartel chief is behind one third of the drugs in the United States
Chicago – just after sunrise on the West Side in Chicago CBS News released an early drive for drugs.
Brian McKnight of the Office for Drug Control (DEA) showed what was going on.
Almost 800 people died from drug overdose in Chicago last year.
McKnight said "probably 90%" of drugs in Chicago comes from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantesie, known simply as El Mencho.
"This is the most important priority for DEA and directly for federal executives in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, chief DEA agent in Mexico.
The reward for El Mencho is $10 million.
He helped detect dozens of people in the jungle of El Mencho's drug labs.
A member of the El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generation, CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs reaching the US via land and sea.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel mixed cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl-contaminated heroin.
El Mencho's head is waiting for a $10 million reward.
As ironically, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug - related charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he created a brutal cartel.
It has a huge number of weapons, RPG, 50-caliber weapons.
Basically he has his own SWAT team," Donahue added.
El Mencho will protect his empire by using such measures as the shooting of a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in public service this year.
In recent years, the brutality of cartels has led to thousands of murders.
According to the Mexican government's statistics, there are about 94 murders every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they can't be handled without protective equipment.
In the cocaine-pack laboratory, it's the mark of a screwdriver.
For more than one third of them, traces lead to the El Mencho cartel.
"He is responsible for sending a poison that kills innocent women and children," said Donahue.
So when a child dies, Donahue believes there is "a great chance," that drugs come from the organisation of El Mencho.
Over 67,000 Americans died last year from overdose.
France: 27 years of age blackmailed the French president and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macrono and the first lady – says the French prosecutor.
The accused shall ensure that he has documents to compromise the President's couple.
He asked the head of state for 300 thousand euros in cash.
The man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work with the police in France said he had received "explosive" documents from a person employed in the Elise Palace.
During the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the Presidential couple, but their disclosure can be a threat to the security of Macron and the first lady of France.
In exchange for their return, he asked for 300 thousand euros – he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters in the previous marriage.
According to the prosecutor, he refused to hand over the documents he was talking about to the police.
He said he would pass them through – but it is not known if these documents really exist.
They were not found during the review at this 27-year-old's apartment.
The man was subjected to psychiatric tests, but his doctors did not detect any serious disorders.
PS4 game will be old school – Sony reveals amazing facts about PlayStation 4
Sony throws more light on the topic of the soon-beginning game available only on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony, as part of the recent State of Play presentation, announced that the Prime Minister of The Last of Us will take place in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new breath-suppression fragment in the chest of play from the upcoming action game.
More specifics were revealed in the days following the loud premiere of the play The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are going through high school climates in a lot of ways.
Decided on something we haven't seen too often since PS 1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several plates.
Neil Druckmann from Naughty Dog confirmed this in a revolutionary interview with The Telegraph, explaining that sequel has grown into one of the most extensive games in history.
"Fabula is ambitious and called on in aspects where she was not the only one," he said.
It had to be so extensive that I could present this kind of story with so many characters.
We didn't mean to create the biggest game, so it just happened.
"We are aware of how many possibilities are hidden in this story. There will be moments when you think you're going to end up, but you realize that it's just the beginning and that a completely new chapter begins," says Drukmann.
It's such an ambitious game that it didn't fit into one BluRay and it's on two plates.
In another place it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two esters of eggie content for adults (information provided by Gamespot).
We're not going to be a dog of surprises, but appearing in the East Eggi game they're going to refer to Naughty Dog's old-school works.
Learn more when The Last of Us: Part Two starts on February 21, 2020 only on PS4.
Persons with PS4 can prepare for the sequel premium, following the Last of Us Remastered available in the PS Plus offer.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, among which is mentioned above by Naughty Dog.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to the MLB The Show 19.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and you want to place a pre-premier order on sequel, Sony has given that there will be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing the replica of Ella's back and her bracelet and a 30-inch figure of this cult form.
Run, scrap and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil will take over Podbeskide and is willing to win.
The Stomil's balls from three colleagues are invincible.
At that time, the Zajzkowski supporters won seven points because they won with Stalla Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match a break in Suwalkah fell.
Now the Olympic team will take Podbeskide on Saturday at 18 a.m., which is listed as one of the favorites to advance to the Extraclass.
The nearest Stomilu rivals take the fourth place in the table and have a point of advantage over the Olsztina team.
The podbeskid on the departures in this season played six times and counted after two victories, retreats and defeats Natomiast Stomil feels very well at his object – at the stadium near al. Pilsudski 69a team of Peter Zączowski won three times and lost once.
Together, in ten rows, the ulsteins gathered 17 points and were in the front of the table, although after two defeats at the start of the game nothing said.
"Every change needs time to be achieved," explains Piotr Skiba.
"Well, we finally got something wrong, we believed in ourselves, and we could work under normal conditions.
We just got together for a ball game.
They're clean heads, they're good atmosphere and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomila's dancers eliminated the Polish Chorz movement from the Puchara, but they needed to do so with a touchdown and a series of criminal rejections.
In the south Poland did not leave Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc because Coach Zajozkowski gave these key players a break before the Saturday deal with Podbeskid.
In Chorzow, however, he played back after the conjugation of Jakub Mosakowski, who finally shot his long-awaited door.
“It’s always nice to get a goal, and I got it at a time so that we can continue playing in the showers (Moscowska was equal to 3:3 in 119 minutes – red.).
My dad used to bite me and laugh that I couldn't get the gate, and I always told him I'd shoot him at a time when he wouldn't expect to."
Now Mosakowski counts back to the basic store, the more that the yellow cards can't play Oleh Tarasenko.
"After that I'm going to get on my training so I can play in the first class," says Mosakowski.
“In Chorz, I did my best to present myself.
However, whether I'm playing or sitting on a reserve box, I'm going to support the team as much as I can.
Because the most important is the team and three points in the match with Podbeskid.
We are sure to have a difficult meeting, in which we will have to run, stretch and fight."
In the middle of the Olsztian defense, Rafal Remish can still play, who has also recently acquired the honor, so whether it will happen, we will find out only on Saturday, the more that Coach Zajozkowski traditionally tries to keep himself secret until the end of the staff matter.
A man raped and murdered his sister
"You will never see the light of the day.
You'll never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, returning to Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so repulsive and ugly that you had to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
The 5-year-old Lizzie disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days until Whipple indicated where the body was hiding.
"How could anyone do this to their own sister?" asked Dejay Smith, a girl's uncle.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," Alexa Whipple told him.
"I would give up everything to meet her again, hug her," said the mother of the murdered girl.
"Our life will never be the same again," added a mixed woman.
As Fox News reports, 22-year-old Whipple didn't show any emotion during the interview.
Last month, he admitted that he had kidnapped, used sexually, and murdered a girl.
The man's lawyer said his client was raised in a "unperfect family".
He was supposed to be tortured as a child.
He also added that Whipple was aware that he had committed a terrible act and was ready to take the punishment.
The man was sentenced to life without being able to apply for parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would transfer nearly $100 million of additional funds to the affected communities.
The programme to provide money for affected farmers will be extended and the criteria for the allocation of additives to farms will be simplified.
The aid package covers almost $34 million for the support initiative for the affected community, which enables farmers to receive up to $3000 in an emergency.
Each of the 13 local self-government areas under the Social Assistance Programme affected will receive up to $1 million of infrastructure grants and assistance in dealing with the consequences of the disaster.
The new support package is an addendum to over $7 billion spent by the government on the drought control fund.

In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters
documentary film: In China the number of divorces has increased twice in the last decade.
The reason for this condition was generally third parties.
More and more men maintain foreign relations, which has led to the formation of a particular industry in the country – a professional funeral of lovers who want to save the marriages of betrayed women.
Let's scan the voice: Ma-te-usz!
Trying to welcome the Prime Minister in the Slovak Fireworks
A special general test was conducted before the election meeting with Prime Minister Maeus Morawieck in Pekara Słąski.
"Your Honor, more louder, more louder, we do not welcome the Prime Minister here!
Let's say, "Ma-te-usz!", he encouraged the leaders.
Unfortunately, the efforts of the enthusiastic leader did not produce the expected result.
The campaign is ongoing.
Politicians are driving across the country, convincing the voters.
Prime Minister Mateus Morawiecki also conducts an intensive campaign, which is a frequent guest in the region as a leader of the PIS.
Each meeting is precisely planned, including the appropriate course.
So it was, and rather, it was supposed to be, in the Slöskies.
The special guest should be especially welcome.
Prior to the meeting with the Prime Minister, the manager of the hall decided to conduct a general test.
There was nothing persistent about the leader trying to encourage the crowd to scandalize the name of the chief of government.
"This will not be a welcome to me, but only to Prime Minister Matthew Moravian!
Also louder, louder my dear!" he encouraged the disentusioned.
Unfortunately, the crowd did not fully accept the hot tenant and reluctantly replied "Ma-te-usz", but the recording of the enthusiastic leader makes a furor on the network.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of the murder of his former wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of the 2014 murder of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring in Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the Stays house on July 9, 2014, requesting the disclosure of his wife's residence, Melanne Haskell, with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys 13 and 4 years old, and two girls 9 and 7, died when Haskell opened fire, as Harris's Sheriff's Office claims.
Only one member of the family survived, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
The authorities said she was seriously injured, but she managed to recover completely.
On Thursday, the jury members of the jury rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of illiteracy.
The jury will gather again on Monday to give the verdict.
The quantum internet is getting closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The U.S. Army's results move the quantum internet closer.
Such internet could offer military capabilities in the area of security, detection and accuracy of maintaining time in a traditional approach to network creation.
The Centre for Widespread Quantum Processing of Military Information Research Laboratory for Development The U.S. Army's Struggle was viewed by researchers at the University of Insbruck who managed to achieve a record transfer of the state of space between matter and light – 50 kilometres away using light cables.
Splitting is a correlation that can occur between quantums such as cubes.
When two cubes are split and one of them is measured, this will have an impact on the measured one of them, even if the other cube is physically removed.
"These [50 kilometers] are two rows of sizes further than was previously possible and it is feasible to start building interurban quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist at the University of Innsbruck and a major researcher in a project whose discovery was published in Nature magazine, Quantum Information section.
The quantitative intermediate networks would consist of the distant chains of physical cubes that are intertwined with each other despite a long physical distance.
Researchers have found that this spread is necessary for the creation of the quantum internet.
"This demonstration is a step forward to achieve a large-scale spread state," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-chairing the military programme supporting these studies.
The quality of the condition split at the second end of the day after the light is also high enough to meet some of the most difficult applications of the quantum networks.
The research team started an experiment from the calcium atom trapped in the ion trap.
With the help of laser bonds, researchers entered the quantum state in jon, at the same time encouraging him to emit the photon in which the quantum information was recorded.
As a result, the quantum state of the atom and the particles of the light were split.
The challenge is to send a photon to the lighthouse cable.
"The photon emitted by ion calcium has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is rapidly absorbed by the lighthouse," Lanyon said.
That is why his team first sent a piece of light through a nonlinear crystal lit by a strong laser beam.
The length of the photon wave was converted to the optimal value from the point of view of the transmission to a long distance – the current standard telecommunications wavelength of the wave is 1550 nanometers.
Then the researchers sent this photon through a 50-kilometre light-emitting cable.
Their measurements show that the atoms and particles of light were still split even after the wave length was transformed and the distance passed.
"The decision to choose calcium means that this result directs the way to the creation of a split network of atomic clocks at large physical distances, because calcium can be co-linked with a high-quality "zegar" cube.
The army is very much interested in cross-platform watch networks built on a large scale due to the application of precise positioning, precise navigation and time synchronisation," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher, who also co-chairs the programme.
