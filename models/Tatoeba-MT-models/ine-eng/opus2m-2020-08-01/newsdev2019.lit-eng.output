Lina Fireman honors Bedford Mayor
In the photo: Lina Ogniscissini sells ice cream during the warm year, and in the winter it's fries.
For more than 40 years, a woman who has been trading in the city centre will be honored, with a private reception.
Lina Ogniscissani, who sells ice cream and fries on Dinky Donuts Street in Bedford Midland Road, along with the family, was invited to have a meal.
Nearly 3,000 people signed a petition online in order to receive or obtain recognition.
Mr. Firenstani said she was honored to wait for such honors.
According to Bradford's uncle Dave Hodgson, Mr. Firesants and children and grandchildren were invited to his office to look at city gifts and historical artifacts and to drink the cup of pepper tea.
"Lina Bedforfe takes a special place and its kiosk is part of the city centre," he said.
I am glad that she accepted my invitation, and I look forward to our meeting in my office so that I can thank Lina for her work in our city."
In her words, Mr. Ognistsati thanked the people of Bedford who thought about her and said: "This is a great honor and a beautiful behaviour."
After the petition, Sarkab Mahmood claimed that he did not expect to receive so many signatures.
After hearing about the reception that is planned to be held by the end of the year, he said: “I am very happy about Lena because she earned it because of her fine character. ”
Street with Alsterio Lambretta club
The Lambretta motorcycles were unchanged for the 7th century fashion culture satellites.
A group of Italian motorists are trying to preserve the spirit of those times.
70 years after the establishment of the first Alstery Lambretta club, about 100 motorists from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered in the Fermana district this weekend.
One of the first two members of the club, Chris Wilson, acquired the first Lambretta in 1966 for about £40.
"I had only a vehicle, but I learned that I could use it in a different way.
It was such a sport.
I didn't get into fashion culture, and now I'm probably too old to do that," he said.
"He was pretty cheap and pretty reliable, you could have bought him for the price available, and he got to do something more than just go from point A to point B."
He participated in the TT Church of the Art Island of Lambretta in a separate start-up.
The first Alsterio Lambretta club was established at the beginning of the 8th century and reorganized 12 years ago.
"About 1971 motorists and other modes of transport are becoming less and less dominant, and clubs were generally affected by anxiety, so I thought, "Everything is the end," said Chris.
"Then some time has shown interest again and it seems to grow more and more."
Philip Steele is the secretary of the Alsterio Lambretta Club, which currently has 97 members, who are responsible for membership.
‘All reasons are different.
Some members were influenced by fashion culture because almost everything started from it.
Others are racing enthusiasts or handicrafts – here you will find everyone.
There are also those who just have interesting vintages.
Many motor oils are modified, so there are no two equals.
There can be no change in engine speed and a quiet ride of 35 or 40 miles per hour, adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved.
Some highly modified motors may reach up to 100 miles per hour."
During the weekend, some motorists had to be pushed in.
And although the weather in Northern Ireland is not always as pleasant as the "Lambretta" parents in Italy, this time the sun shines on motorists driving around Fermana.
Ruth Davidson asks for silence on the issue of Brexito
Ruth Davidson asked his fellow Conservatives for a "silent period", so that the Prime Minister could agree on Brexito.
Scotland's head said that within two years of the EU referendum, enough time had been spent on the debate.
She expressed her opinion on Boris Johnson's premier plan, which he called "intellectual and completely absurd".
She told the BBC Sunday Politics Scotland that it was time to support the Prime Minister.
At a party conference held in Birmingham, she said: “Over the past two years, we have had time for discussions.
The former Secretary of Foreign Affairs served in one of the best cabinets in the country's history and during that period a large part of the current plan, which had already been recognised last November.
The Conservatives now have to support the Prime Minister, allow her to complete the transaction and help implement the plans in the country.
I think the period of silence would be very useful."
Their comments followed a sharp criticism of Brexit's debate, which was first expressed by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
In an interview with BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later confirmed that she believed in Brexit and that her cabinet plan could ensure a favourable free trade deal with the European Union.
Mr Davidson also said that he would promise to prevent the second Scottish referendum on independence from taking part in other elections, because in 2014 "the shots promised that such an event would be the only one in their own generation".
She was asked about a possible re-re-rapporteur on Brexito: "If we are talking about Scotland's history, I have repeatedly stated that we cannot repeat the referendum if you are a nationalist and the result is not pleasing to you.
I would do my best if I said that there could be another referendum on Brexit, because I expected another result."
Road M8 reopened after the police incident
The M8 motorway was reopened after the police incident in Glazg.
According to the police, a little earlier than 07.00 hours were closed in both directions in the 15 Townhead intersection due to concern about the pedestrian.
The road was closed for three hours and was damaged in the city where the marathon "Great Scottish Run" takes place.
A man in his 20 ’ s was later sent to the Royal Hospital in Glazgo.
Christine'a Blasey Ford confirmed a statement on sexual harassment suspected of Brettas Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who was friends in high school with Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford, accused the candidate of the Brett Kavanaugh High Court of sexual harassment when both of them were teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate Court Committee and explained that he himself did not remember the house of the evening during which the attack might have occurred, but believed in the Ford story.
In the past, Keyser, through his lawyer, made a statement that he did not remember that evening and did not even know if he had agreed to Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh’s statement was often referred to as proof of his innocence, but did not mention Keyser’s statement that she believed in Ford’s words.
On Friday, President briefed the FTB to conduct an investigation during the week when Republican Senator Jeff Flake and other independent senators asked to give time to the investigation and to postpone the Senate’s full vote on Kavanaugh for the week.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to his lawyer to the committee saying that he wanted to contribute to the additional FTB investigation on Kavanaugh.
"But, as my client has already explained, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and does not remember the dinner or meeting he would have had with or without Dr. Ford," says Keyser's lawyer Howard Walsh.
The letter further explains that Keyser “did not reject Dr. Ford’s statement and has already told the press that he believes in Dr. Ford’s certificate.”
"But the simplest and unchanging truth is that it cannot approve it, because it does not remember that event," continues the letter.
Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, who was probably next to the attack, also claimed to have contributed to the FTB investigation.
People of Chicago report a life with and benefit from a corrupt police officer
The chief prosecutor of Illinois is trying to replace the Chicago police history after a dark period.
It is believed that a dishonest policeman used innocent people in social housing and unjustly captured many people.
So far, 42 people have been unjustly convicted.
Ida Wells, instead of the project's social housing project, is currently only an empty site, and their inhabitants had spent more than a decade in the horse without fear of using corrupt Chicago policemen.
They were headed by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
The residents accused him and his tactical body of using property, of lying and coercion of police reports and of charges.
Willie's Martin and Cleonas Gloviers are two of those judges who have so far been tried by the District Attorney General Kim Foxx.
“If you didn’t work with him, you ended up bad.
You were his enemy.
You stopped him from acting and profiting," said Cleon Gloviers about Watts.
"I was very afraid.
I wanted to get out of this area,
But I had nowhere to go," said Willie Martin.
Members of the Foxx Ethics Division shall review further cases related to Watts from 30 to 40.
Ida B. Wells, the resident of the social home of Landon Allen, said that many people decided not to follow Watts.
"There was a lot of trouble," he said.
"But that wasn't important."
According to another former resident, Clarissa Baker, no one believed in the people's words about the officer in charge.
“He has his own receipt.
Who will believe us?"
said Baker.
Joshua Tepferis, working on a project at the University of Chicago, said that nobody really believed in them until now.
"It all went on because these people didn't seem important to them, and they didn't care, because they were black people living in social housing, so they thought they were still guilty," Tepferis said.
‘Sergeant Watts sat in prison for 22 months in 2013 to try to rob FTB informants.
Martez Wise was also imprisoned by Watts.
I just had a son.
I couldn't be with him for four years.
He almost didn't know me because he was just born, so I had to get back in touch with him," said Wisee.
"I've lost four years without a matter."
The 72-year-old Fidelity believes in the success of block chains, virtual reality and artificial intelligence
The potential of the Fidelity block chains was observed before 2018 when all corporations started talking about this technology.
The Director-General, Abby Johnson, led the investment in cryptocurrency – the most risky and unstoppable asset class in recent years.
"About two years ago, I and the other senior leaders were just smart about what's going on, especially in the Bitcoin market," Johnson said.
We started talking, and we realized that we had to find out.
Smartness prompted the launch of "cast" bitokins in the New Hampshire department, when this crypto-currency price was about $180.
Last December the price was nearly $20,000 and, says Johnson, “we were surprised that the prices were up and we started to earn, even though we never expected it to be. ”
It did not indicate how much bitocks were "claimed" or how much Fidelity was earned.
"Fidelity" workers are clearly interested in these technologies.
For workers, the block chain club called "Bitas and Blocks" is now holding about 2,600 members, organizing seminars and meetings with specialists.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which gave Fidelity customers the opportunity to verify the remaining cryptocurrency using the Fidelity mobile software.
In 2015, the possibility to sacrifice funds in Bitcoins was created.
According to Johnson, the company rejected most of the other possible Bitcoin uses or at least briefly refused them.
We're trying to monitor the market.
Until now, Katie Chase, the main strategy of the Fidelity Technology Centre and the Head of the Block Chain Incubator (which is part of FCAT), is looking for ways to use public and business-based block chains.
Chase could not comment on specific projects, but revealed that there was a great interest of clients, partners and employees.
"It's all very new.
If you gain information, you will realize that you are still trying to find the concept evidence," Chase said.
We have tried to adapt block chains to different situations and we have learned a lot, but technology is not yet so advanced as to solve such problems."
Until now, she says, the group is focusing more on trying to understand the nature of these obstacles.
They try to understand how to calculate the value of physical objects, such as works of art, chips or use block chains in the supply chain.
"As far as this is not at the centre of attention, but I think it will finally be interesting," Chase said.
"Fidelity will be ready."
As an example, she pointed out the Peebble newspaper, which was completely unsuccessful in its marketing standards, but finally bought Fidelity.
Its group set up a smart watch program, which was stopped after three years, when millions were gathered through Kickstarter's collective financing project.
The Apple Watch appeared on the market, and Fidelity was ready.
It quickly adapted the Pebble application to the new Apple product.
"We were not very sure that the Peebble clock would be popular, but we wanted to be ready if people liked smart watches," she said.
"We have gained knowledge and were prepared when smart watches were released into the mass market."
The island was devastated by earthquakes and tsunamis
On Friday, 29 September, the Indonesian islands hit Sulavesi with a powerful 7.5 - foot - high earthquake, causing tsunami and killing nearly 400 people.
There are many injured and the number of dead is expected to rise.
According to the Indonesian disaster management agency, electricity and communication are not affected and therefore it is difficult to assess the damage in the city of Palu and in the nearby Dongal fishing community.
California’s students wore racist masks
As reported by the CNN branch of KGTV, the Escondido Schools Union this week confirmed that about 10 students had taken a badly-conceived decision to demonstrate racism in an event for senior classes.
"We are proud that everyone in our school is accepted and not afraid of diversity," said Adriana Lepe-Ramirez.
"We will not tolerate the promotion of racism and exclusion."
The report also indicates that the incident is being investigated by Escondido secondary school, union officials and local police.
"The school administrators have contacted the parents and guardians of the adult students and will be subject to disciplinary penalties," the report says.
On the basis of a report by the police, students of the school in the north of San Diego were wearing shirts with letters from which the racist record was originally written and photographed during the picnic.
In general, the school approves recordings in advance, but when photographing official photos, some students choose their words.
The Union report states that such behaviour "is incompatible with the culture, values or history of Escondido secondary school".
"We need to understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we make every day," Lepe-Ramirez said.
"The Escondido secondary school will continue to enjoy family values and unity-based culture throughout the community."
The former student of Cade's Panel for the channel KGTV claimed that he had been misled by the insulting image seen in the social media.
"It hurt me personally," he said.
“It seemed funny to them, but it wasn’t.
Only fools can laugh at such things."
A heart operation waiting for Shaquille O'Nealo's son Shareefas will pass the 1st UCLA season
The son of Shaquille O'Nealo, a member of the basketball museum, will have to spend the first UCLA season due to heart failure.
According to TMZ Sports, O'Neal will have a heart surgery to eliminate the disorder observed by UCLA physicians during a routine examination.
"Thank God, UCLA doctors have seen the problem before," said O'Nealas.
“As soon as rehabilitation takes place, I will attend lectures and be a normal student.
I'll be right back."
O'Nealas signed an official intentional protocol in August, promising to play on the UCLA team, which has already attracted no name and is one of the best first-class teams in the 2018-2019 season in the country.
"Shareefas has improved considerably in high school," said top coach Steve Alford to reporters last month.
"He's a high-school, he has skills, he's an athletic and will be a great member of the new team.
We are pleased with the composition of this year's team and shareefas will complement it.
It has a good basis and will be able to improve in both ends of the square."
According to "247Sports", 18-year-old O'Nealas is a 4 star candidate, with 8 seats in the 2018 news rankings as a heavy national attacker and 41 seats as a player.
Before joining UCLA, O'Neala's last season helped the Crossroads high school achieve a record score – 25:9.
Sarah's Palin's eldest son is accused of violence against his father
28 m. Track Palin was arrested for three offenses, including assault.
He was arrested for family violence for the first time on Sunday.
According to court records, the incident occurred at Palina’s home in Vasilo, Alaska, where Track Palina wounded her father to the blood when he argued about the truck.
The 28th year following the Saturday incident was arrested for three violations, including assault.
The court’s documents indicate that the dispute began when a man called to pick up the truck, but the father refused to give it up.
As explained in the Court’s statement, Track Palin was arrested for first-degree burglary and fourth-degree assault and a fourth-degree criminal offence, and his father was injured in the face and head.
On the basis of the documents, Palina, the police spoke to him, called him “prosecutors” and ordered him not to use weapons.
The Court’s statement also states that before the arrest, the man fell on the roof of the garage.
The words of Sarah Palin recorded in the court documents are that her son was “serious” and “used some medicines”.
It was also noted that Track Palina told the police that she had had several bottles of beer before.
He was arrested in early 2016 and charged with family violence against women, with an obstacle to reporting family violence and possession of arms during the winter.
"When I see how my son feels when he comes back, I understand the other families who are suffering from post-traumatic stress, and I know what the soldiers are going to hurt," said the former Republican candidate to Vice President and the governor of Alaska.
"Now better than ever, I understand that America needs the best leader who will respect and value them."
Elizabeth Warren said he was thinking about the candidacy of the presidents after the mid-term election
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct the corrupt government that women have to lead," said the Senator of Democrats, speaking of the minions gathered at the Holjok Rotuška of Massachusetts.
"So I promise you: after 6 November, I will think carefully about whether it's not worth running for presidents."
Warren, who was trying to defend his position in the competition with a Republican representative in the state of Geoffu Diehl, said earlier that I would not run for presidents because he wants to pay attention to the work of the Senate.
"It is very important to focus on the mid-term elections and to stop acting as if the only important thing was 2020," she told reporters in August when she spoke at the National Press Club.
"The next important fight is the mid-term elections, and they are important not only in Massachusetts, but also throughout the country."
Warren has long been regarded as a potential candidate for democratics in 2020, who can compete with President Donald Trump.
However, they would be facing a difficult struggle for the first elections, which may involve other well-known Democrats – former Vice President Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.
A third imaginative death in less than a year associated with a remarkable mental health clinic
According to The Mail, a third person had been killed in a luxury psychiatric clinic for years.
The television comedian daughter Shaquelle Vidal died on April 7th, after spending almost a month volunteering in West London, Marylebon, in the Nightingale hospital.
Her boyfriend James Lyle (57) was the manager of the Insurance Insurance Fund, a millionaire and a former supporter of the Conservative Party, paid for her maintenance for five years.
The former chef died almost six months after the day Daisy Boyd (28th) was celebrated by Rose Gray, one of the founders of River Cafe.
After being separated from the publishing company's successor Dan Macmillan (43) who suffered from cancer on 5 October, Boyd died of cancer, which was illegally brought by a clinical visitor.
Two months ago, an artist named Alan MacDonald (61) was released from the hospital four days after his release.
In May, the Supervisory Quality Commission criticised the Nightingale Clinic because it did not sufficiently try to prevent the introduction of illegal substances.
The BBC series "Mock The Week" was registered at the clinic on 11 March at Avos Vidal daughter Shaquelle.
Last week, at a meeting of the Westminster Crown Court, Queen's lawyer Katie Gollop said that on 29 March Shaquelle left AWOL and returned to an understanding of the state of mind after the week.
Mr Gollop, acting on behalf of Ava Vidal, said: “My client wants to find out what happened to Shaquelle, who she was with and what she was doing.”
Ms. Lyle called Shaquelle a "baby".
“I knew that Shaquelle continued to work with James Lyle and he was in New York at the time, ” said John Gordillo, an unofficial director of the comedy.
Mr. Gordillo at the meeting revealed that on 4 April Shaquelle called him and said he wanted to buy and drink cyanide and he called clinics "more than a dozen times" 20 minutes after this call, but no one answered.
"It seems to me that further events could have been avoided if anyone had responded," he added.
On 5 April, the clinician’s doctor found that Shaquelle’s mental condition is extremely simple.”
Less than 48 hours later, she went through a running computer.
The representative of Nightingale expressed his sympathy to his family and friends and said: “Our clinical objective is to provide high-quality care in a safe, treatment-friendly environment.”

Led Zeppelin was again brought before the court on the allegedly stolen Stairway To Heaven guitar rifo
Led Zeppelin was again brought before the court in 1971 for the guitar rifo used in the song "Starway To Heaven", which was allegedly stolen by the group.
It is said that part of the British group’s 1971 hits have been staged.
The Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 judgment that the group did not copy the name of the other group ‘Spirit’.
In 2015, Michael Skidmore, a trusted guitarist, filed an application.
It seems that the talk about the "Led Zeppelin" song "Stairway to Heaven" will take a long time – as it does itself.
The group will once again stand before the court on the charges of having stolen the 1971 Ballad guitar reef.
The U.S. Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 judgment that the group did not copy the hit from the start of the Spirit group.
It is alleged that the judge made mistakes, such as misinformed the defendants about copyright laws.
It was returned to the court.
“Spirit” guitarist Randy Wolfe’s trusted Michael Skidmore’s first application was filed in 2015.
Police raids in Michigan ended when a policeman crossed into them with a suspected murder
The suspected Michigan resident of his girlfriend's murder was arrested after the police raiders who ended up passing him to the police car.
Adam Nolin is suspected to have shot his girlfriend in Wyoming on Thursday at 33 C.E., 27 C.E.
He was brought to court on Friday at a hospital where he was found by an officer passing him by a police SUV car, because Nolin shot policemen trying to escape the highway in which he was trafficked.
Nolin has been charged with five serious crimes, including assault to kill and escape from the police.
"The court is not ordinary in the hospital, but this is not the first case," said Captain James Maguffee of the Wyoming Police.
"The treatment is appropriate, but the process of justice must also continue.
Judges often adapt so that it can be implemented."
Nolin's girlfriend's body was found on Thursday in a mobile home in the Creekside Estates area.
The mother of two children was shot with one shot, and the police immediately identified Noline as the suspect.
Then the police issued a public warning about Nolin and provided a brief description of the black Dodge pictogram of the man and his 1996 Black Dodge.
The man noticed his pickup and went out on US 131, when the police tried to stop him.
Nolin and Picapa came to the concrete wall, then ran out of the car and let them run by the highway.
As he ran away, he shot at the invading policemen.
One of the police officers sat in a police SUV car and passed Nolin from behind.
The observer filmed the event.
Noline has been taken to a hospital with severe but stable conditions and will remain there until she is discharged and transferred to Kent County Prison.
"This event has shown that West Michigan police are risking their health to protect the community," Maguffee said.
"They took the man quite quickly and with the right measures and we are very proud of them."
He is also accused of fleeing from the police, of carrying a hidden weapon, and of a serious crime committed in the use of a firearm.
He's still not charged with his girlfriend's murder because the investigation is still under way.
"Of course, we are still conducting a murder investigation, which we will soon finish so that we can submit it to the Attorney-General of Kent's District," Maguffee said.
The judge commended the courageous man who had thrown his teeth into his house for the intruder
The judge had no pity for the brave man who stood before two criminals who tried to break into his house.
Although one of his contemporaries tried to drive him a wooden sheet, at 63 C.E., David Oldham was not disappointed.
The man in charge of the university’s territory defends himself, hits both criminals, and smashes one of their teeth.
The intruders fled, but after a mustache on Mr. Oldham's blood left, according to which Craig Ford was identified and arrested after four months.
In announcing his sentence to Ford, who lost his teeth trying to enter the house of Mr. Oldham's 400 000 pounds of individual value in Ormskerke, Lankašyre, the Royal Judge Clement Goldstone said: "You probably didn't expect such a reaction from Mr. Oldham – when he was dreaming of seeing only the eyes and nose, you met him at the house, he kicked you.
He also struck your partner, who tried to break into the second height and jump off the roof.
On Friday, after he had sentenced Ford to prison for three and four months, the judge said: “I hope you have learned two lessons.
The first is not to offend David Oldham, the second is not to start with the police.
Because of your crimes, you now have one tooth less than before and you have a dog.
It's still a little bit of a punishment."
He added: “I want to congratulate Mr Oldham on how he responded to your actions.”
Prosecutor Derek Jones said that the crime had already been committed by Ford in 2016 for another break-in and had to be fined three years, but had been executed in a fair way.
Mr. Oldhams told the Royal Court of Liverpool that he had jumped when he heard a noise at home on April 5 at about 7:00 p.m.
“ Mr. Oldham, who is a wealthy man, ” said Jones, “was brave enough to leave the house and oppose the accused.
Fearing for his safety, he struck him in the face, so that he broke his teeth.
Then the other intruder jumped from the roof against Mr. Oldham, who had instinctively kicked him in the face."
According to Mr. Jones, the fellow took a wooden table and tried to drive to Mr. Oldham, and Ford said: “Kill him, he has broken my teeth.”
The co-rapporteur told Mr Oldham: "If you let us go, we will leave" and he and Ford fled the scene.
On August 2, the police paid Ford a visit to the Waverttree area.
Ford blew up the police dog, and then this guy's stuck in his heel.
It is believed that the second intruder is still free.
Not having a permanent residence. Fordas admitted guilty of burglary, confusion and dangerous driving, although this was prohibited and he did not have a driver's license.
The critics of these activists, Johnson, met with applause
Their activists today undermined Boris Johnson when he was described as "a poor and aggressive man".
P Johnson, attempting to convince ordinary people in his compromise talks about Brexit, has received a strong assessment by former Trade Minister Digby's Jones, who was also endorsed by the participants at the Birmingham Conference this afternoon.
David David also attacked Mr. Johnson because he was concerned about the headlines, not the strong policy.
Speaking with MailOnline, Mr. May, in the cabinet of ministers, he added that he was simply "slow" because he could not be a full-fledged leader.
The opposition was met when the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs again attacked the Prime Minister's Chequers plan and concluded it "intelligible" and "absolutely absurd".
Mr Johnson also added that he sincerely believed in the project, and this was what she did two years ago in the referendum.
He also called on the government to support ambitious projects such as the bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May said that her critics were playing political games and claimed that she was not bluffing and ready for difficult negotiations with the EU.
In an interview with Andrew Marro BBC, which was launched by the conference, Mr. May said, "I believe in Brexit."
Former Labour Minister Lord Jones, now acting independently, has been waiting for the previous approval to hear Brexito's perspective.
People were pleased when he gave an opinion on Mr Johnson, who probably answered the questions of the businessmen concerned.
Without specifically calling Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones made it clear that he was “a poor and aggressive man”.
"Business is very important, therefore, by saying "velniop business", the former secretary of foreign affairs showed that he is really a poor and aggressive man," he said.
"I totally disagree with him."
Lord Jones also welcomed the reaction of Mr. May, who was watching his speech in the hall to the meeting of the leaders of Salzburg, heard the "appropriations" of EU leaders to her cabinet plan.
The Scottish Taurus leader Ruth Davidson also once criticized Mr Johnson, recalling that during the negotiations on Brexit, he was a high-ranking government official.
In the cabinet of ministers, Mr May said to MailOnline that the intervention is not very serious and Mr Johnson does not have enough supporters between Parliament to be able to expel the minister.
They said: “Now such news is not very dangerous.
He is noisy, but he does not have enough support in the parliamentary party, and he knows that.
We see the sharp contrast between David Davis, who respectfully expressed his opinion, and Boris, who meets his personal ambitions."
Business Secretary Greg Clarks criticized Mr Johnson, who attacked businessmen who were skeptical about Brexit.
Speaking at that conference in Birmingham, Mr. Clark said that Mr. Johnson was "very wrong".
He said: “I am amazed that someone in general can think that way.
There is no successful economy in the world that would not have successful prosperous businesses."
In an interview with the "Sky News" issue of Ridge on Sunday, Mr Davis acknowledged that the coming months will not be easy, as the EU will try to make the United Kingdom very comfortable.
However, he believes that the government must not hesitate to reach an agreement similar to that of Canada, rather than the one proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers.
When asked how Mr. Johnson managed to lead the thorium, he did not miss the opportunity to take charge of the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
In congratulating Mr Johnson's proposal to establish a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: "One of the British policy shortcomings is a policy that has fantastic ideas."
He added: "Our communication is chaotic and many of his ideas are suitable for headlines, but not for strong politics."
Bulgaria issued 80 million £ European taxpayers' money for poor restaurant
Bulgaria has spent £80 million on European taxpayers' funds for poor old-fashioned castle restaurants, which now seem to be built from "sur and cardboard".
The Balkan country has issued £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning the previous size, the restaurant was waiting for guests.
The Krakra Country Government has promised to carry out an incredible task.
The Bulgarian government has issued ten million EU cities for free medieval restaurants.
The Balkan country has issued £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund to restore the old castles and fortresses, but rather than returning their former greatness, it has been asked about the construction work.
Relics after the expensive reconstructions appear to be built from "sur and cardboard", so it is no longer attractive to tourists.
For example, the monumentists realized that the fortress of the western Bulgarian city of Pernik in the Middle Ages of Pernik, Krakra and the Roman fortress of Trayanov Vrata near Ihtimaan was reconstructed using polymeric concrete, most commonly used as a base.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian government have privately agreed on the need to learn from this failure.
"The fortress is a closed state," said architect and monumentary Stella Duleva about Trayanov Vrata.
It lasted 16 centuries, and now it's broken."
Such reactions occurred after the Krakra fort restaurant in Pernike, and the local government promised to remove the part delivered in 2019.
Perniko’s fortress, due to unexpected modifications, has been identified as a “pillar from cardboard”.
Byzantium Yailata is a fortress built in a "survy fortress" because it was restored from smooth white blocks that do not fit the facade affected by the weather conditions.
These unsuccessful efforts coincide with new doubts about how the European Union is using the funds of the development funds.

Now Facebook under the new European Data Laws threatens a huge fine
After a break of at least 50 million accounts, Facebook may have to pay a penalty of £1.25 billion.
The offenders could have obtained an account for the security gap and could have disclosed a lot of hidden personal information.
However, Facebook reported the break-in only on Friday three days ago, and couldn't tell how many British accounts were damaged until yesterday.
As the search for programmers continues, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who checks that the Internet giant meets European data compliance requirements because its central headquarters is located in Dublin, criticised the company by saying, "The report is incomplete."
Facebook under the new European Union data law is a major penalty because companies may be required to pay up to four per cent of global turnover.
Last year, Facebook earned £31.2 billion.
The offenders reached the account using the Facebook function "View As" that allows users to see how their profiles look to others.
Dead journalist and publisher Vladas Dargis
V. Dargis was born on 2 August 1926 in the village of Pakempini in the Akmenė district.
At the end of World War II, in 1944, while avoiding Soviets, he moved from Kaunas, where he was taught and lived, to the West, and settled in England since 1947.
In 1992 he returned to Lithuania and lived in Vilnius.
In 1952-1957, V. Dargis led the publishing of "Nida Press" in London.
In 1954 he set up the Niedas Book Club and led him until 1957 and in 1983-1991.
The paper was printed in the bookshop of the Nidos Club (later "Europos Lietuvis") and in other publications of the British Lithuanians.
The Nieds Book Club released the latest Lithuanian writers living in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Sweden, Germany, and Sweden.
In 1959-1961, Dargis worked as a U.S. Radio "The Voice of America" (Miunchene) dictator, director, journalist.
For a long time, Dargis worked in the Board of Directors of the Lithuanian Home Company in London; he was elected Director of the Press Department in 1956-1957, 1982, President of the Board in 1984-1986, and was the administrator of the Lithuanian Lithuanian Print Office in 1984-1987.
In 1974-1976 he was a member of the Council of the Lithuanian Union of Great Britain (DBLS), elected in 1982 as a member of the Board of the DBLS Centre for Information and Relations with Sections, from 1983 to 1983 as Vice-President for Cultural Affairs, from 1985 to 1989 as Vice-President for Press and Information.
In 1987, Dargis became the chief editor of the Lithuanian newspaper "European Lietuvis" of the Great Britain and was almost ten years old.
Its initiative on 9 January 1990 was first printed in Vilnius.
The weekly newspaper in the capital of Lithuania has been allowed here since autumn 1992 and has reached Lithuanians in various countries around the world for three years.
On the initiative of Dargio and his personal funds at the beginning of 1994, as an annex to the "European Lithuanian" began to allow the monthly "Lithuanian Godos" and together with "European Lithuanian" was distributed free of charge among the Lithuanians.
By the founding decision, the publication of "European Lithuanian" was returned to Britain in early 1996.
While living in Great Britain, V. Dargis always had the hope of returning to free Lithuania and happily agreed to regained Lithuania's independence.
In a printed word, he has done much to promote Lithuanianism, glorifying the Republic of Lithuania and contributing to the preservation of its name in the world during the year of occupation.
V. Dargio’s family informed that Velionis would be robbed of Vilnius’s funeral home, in Hall 2 (The Netherlands of 22, Vilnius).
Greeting with Velion from Tuesday, 6 November. Wednesday, 7 November.
The following records are heard in the MG Baltic case: the defendant discussed Gabrieli Landsberg
A hearing was opened between the interview of former Vice-President Raymond Kurlianski and the former "worker" of Vytautas Gapshi.
When listening to the record, it is difficult to understand exactly what people are talking about.
True, the record says that R. Kurlianski and V. Gapšys are talking about the Christmas celebration, calling the name of the current Conservative leader Gabriel Landsberg several times, but what exactly is said is hard to understand.
Claims for both natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, charges were filed against three legal and five natural persons: the Working Party and the Liberal Consensus, the Group of MG Baltic, the former liberal and the "workers" leaders of E. Masiuli, the Vytaut Gapsi, the former Liberal, the former Liberal, the Seimas member, the G. Steponavič, and the former Vice-President of MG Baltic.
The Working Party is suspected of having an impact on acidification and trade, the Liberal phenomenon is suspected of acidification, trade and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of papering and trading of these parties.
Officials suspect that the politicians took or said about the clashes with the then Vice-President MG Baltic, Mr Kurlianski, and subsequently proposed or supported initiatives for the group in the Seimas and other institutions.
The former President of the Liberal Consensus, E. Masiulis, is suspected of the effect of trade, of acidification and illegal enrichment, of the suspicions presented to the former vice-president of this party by the abuse of Mr Steponaviči, of the former member of the Vilnius City Council by St. Gustaini.
V. Gapšis is suspected of the effects of acidification and trade, Kurlianskis - of the effects of papermaking and trade.
Question: Who has the greatest chance to win the second presidential election tour?
The poll on the second round of elections included four candidates in the top rankings - economist Gitana Nauseda, the unpublished minister Saulius Skvernelis and two candidates who participated in the first elections of the Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) party - Seimas Ingrid Šimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Ushakas.
True, Sunday proved that TS-LCD had received support in the elections by I. Šimonyte, and V. Ushaka withdrew from the election struggle.
As the figures show, if the elections were to take place in the near future, in all cases the second president would win Mr. Nauseda, but the leader of Vilmorus, sociologist Vladas Gaidys, says there are too many conclusions to make.
"Separate (from others - DELFI) Nauseda, but it is very important to see whether the parties are talking about or about people who are dynamic.
These were the duplicates of the Shimonyts from one study to another, and Nauseds had stopped growth, and Ushaka had even decreased.
This growth is very important to you," says the sociologist.
Moreover, in view of the results of the survey, it is clear that a number of people have not yet decided what they will vote for or think about in general.
If I. Šimonytė and S. Kwarnelis had fought in the second presidential election, the fight would have been strained - for I. Šimonytė would have voted 32.7%, for S. Kwarneli 30.9%.
It is true that even 36.4% of the people replied that they would not vote for any of these candidates, or that they did not know what they would vote for, or that they would vote for nothing.
Sociologist V. Gaidys once again stressed that until now we have not seen a full picture, because all candidates who would apply to the less successful Lithuanian electorate have not yet been published.
"If we look at last year's elections, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where's the candidate for social democrats?
When you publish, you will see how his opportunities with other candidates turn out.
So that Lithuanian side, which is less successful until it is less reflected," said V. Gaidys.
Politologist Mažvydas Jastramski, at Vilnius University of International Relations and Political Sciences (VU TSPMI) says that the conclusions are still very early, and all three candidates, after being rejected from the fight after V. Ushaka, appear to be conditional.
"I can say from my research experience that these differences mean nothing.
The 5 percentage points difference certainly does not show the advantage of any candidate.
The only thing I could see is that Nauseda would look good against Ushaka... again, in view of the fact that those people would come to really vote.
Naseda v Quavernel also looks good, but we now compare apples and potatoes because, for example, Naseda has already announced that he will participate, Quavernel has not been published.
In addition, the survey was conducted before the first conservative elections, how would it look after them?" says the politician.
According to him, Mr. Nauseda has a little extra, but once all the candidates have been announced, he can get through.
"The situation is roughly equal.
Naseda, Quavernelis, Shimonytė - results are in balance.
I would like to remind you that half of the year before the 2003 presidential election, Roland Pax had 5% of the support to vote for it and then won the elections.
"It is impossible to make any predictions," said Mr Jastramski.
DELFI recalls that in the presidential elections candidates have already been published by economist G. Nauseda, Seimas Member I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist, Seimas Member Aušra Maldeikienė, member of the Liberal Alliance Petras Austrevičius, Seimas Member Naglis Puteris and member of the European Parliament Valentinas Mazuronis.
Iran accuses Israel of attempted cyberattack
"The regime in which the history of cyber-weapon use is clear from such cases as (computer virus) Stuxnet (dissemination), this time tried to damage Iran's communications infrastructure," - via Twitter wrote Minister of Information Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi.
He referred to the attack by Stuxnet in 2010, which caused damage to Iran's nuclear facilities.
It is believed that Israel and the United States have set up this malicious program.
"Because of our technical teams' alertness, they're left empty-handed.
We will continue to talk about this counter-action in the international forums," stressed Mr J. A. Hieromi.
Deputy Minister Hamidas Fattahi said that the technical team had recorded many attempts to penetrate their systems on Monday, but the attacks had been "defenced".
Impulses's health club did a bad thing, and he failed to recover.
The accident occurred about 10.40 a.m.
In the swimming pool, a man (born 1945) suddenly fell ill, and he scurried under water.
The man was quickly pulled out of the water, but he was already unconscious.
He was tried for recovery.
Soon, the emergency doctor also tried to rescue him, but he was unable to save his life.
On his way to the hospital, he died in a car.
This disaster was noted by the head of the Impulse Clubs Network, Antan Sakalauskas.
"We say that a 73-year-old man visited our health club on Monday morning with his wife, Mr. Fabionsky.
The pool customer walked for about 30 minutes, then climbed to the pool track to relax and suddenly fell after a few minutes.
The party was people - the client who was swimming in the joint road and the pool supervisor - responded immediately, pulled him out of the water and began to recover.
The man was constantly being brought up until he arrived quickly.
The club’s staff immediately called for rapid medical assistance, which arrived within 5 minutes.
Upon arriving, the doctor restored the man’s pulse and breathing and moved him to a medical car.
In the hospital, doctors tried to stabilize the male’s health, and unfortunately, 20 minutes later, we received information that the male had not survived.
We mean a sincere compassion for a dead man’s family because of his loss.
According to the original data, the incident could lead to health problems of the client.
According to information provided to family physicians, he has diabetes.
It should be noted that with serious health problems, it is always very important to assess your options properly and to consult doctors and health clubs.
In all health clubs’ pool rooms, there is a wake-up supervisor whose main task is to monitor the pool, its access and ensure the safety of customers, and he distinguishes from other employees a sharp suit.
Such pool supervisors shall have radio stations which can be contacted immediately by the administration and the registry, respond to their requests or request assistance.
Four times a year, staff training is being carried out in connection with the security programme - much more often than is required by law.
During this period, workers are broadening theoretical and practical knowledge, training in how to deal with disasters, monitoring or ensuring that workers properly comply with the rules of procedure and internal procedures.
How Portugal has radically solved the problem of heroin

Now, just after ten of them, the country is proud of one of the lowest drug-related mortality indicators in the world.
In Norway, his son died, he changed four families and no longer speaks Lithuanian
According to the LNK press release, four years ago Lithuania lost the right to look after her son and to see him through the decision of the Norwegian Child Rights Service Barnevernet and the courts.
Women’s history has led to an international scandal followed by the entire media.
The nation's dots about the boy's return to Lithuania for his mother both in Lithuania and in Norway.
However, the public did not contribute to the return of a son with Lithuanian citizenship.
Today, a woman relates how she has lived apart from her son for the last few years and how she and her child’s meetings take place after two years.
At the time of the loss of the right to cherish the son, the boy was 8 years old, today as a 12th.
For the first two years, Gardena never saw her son again, it was forbidden.
Later, she was given the right to see her son twice a year, just one hour later.
During the last few months of the trial, the number of sights for Lithuania increased to three times a year and was extended to two hours.
Meetings with the son remind each time of seeing a hard time in prison - watching officers and going to them - a secret operation.
"The son changed even four families and no longer speak Lithuanian," - Heart this Tuesday will open Beauty, her story - in the LNK edition
Eligible Massoula will not be repaid for the personal money taken over by the Kraut
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal announced that it had dismissed the complaint from the defendant.
The decree shall be final and uncomplicated.
In the case of political corruption, the former leader of the Liberals' conscience, E. Masiulis, appealed to the Court of Appeal, asking him to return some personal money - the money taken from him and his wife's money.
A total of more than 242 thousand euros was taken through the crater from E. Masulio.
These moneys are subject to a temporary limitation of ownership rights and are continuously extended.
The last time the Vilnius District Court extended it on October 15th.
E. Masiulis The Court of Appeal did not ask for all money - it seeks to recover from the marriage money taken from 800 euros and its money - 690 euros, 130 UK weight sterling, 1600 US dollars.
The former policy says that the last money was spent on a planned trip to the United States.
E. Masulio's lawyer Mindaugas Bliuvas asked the Court of Appeal to return this money on Monday, because the spouses were working well paid and had the opportunity to have such amounts.
Prosecutor Just Laucius asked the court to dismiss the complaint.
"The judgment of the Vulnerable District Court is lawful and reasonable and does not restrict any more of the assets listed in the accusations.
The Court rightly found that there were grounds for confiscation of assets, as well as for confiscation of expanded assets," Mr Laucius said at a court hearing.
On 15 October, the Vilnius District Court decided not to return more than 242 thousand euros to E. Masuli for the accused of political corruption.
These money can be found through the sharp corruption of the old policy in the home and in the car.
The College of Three Judges found that the substance of the case shows that ownership rights are limited only to funds that constitute a matter of criminal offences committed against E. Masiu.
"In view of the extent of the limitation, it is concluded that the right of the accused's property is not disproportionately restricted or the limitation is applied too long," - the judges of Nijol Zimkinė, Jurgitis Kolyčienė and the Fire Trompulle are written in the judgment.
The Judges noted that the case of E. Masiulis is accused of serious crimes, the criminal case is large and complex and therefore it is necessary to extend the temporary limitation of the defendant’s property in order to ensure possible confiscation of the property and to extend the confiscation of the property.
The prosecutors say that former MG Baltic Vice-President Raymond Kurlianski has given E. Masouli 106 thousand euros for the group's decision-making in Seim.
Both defendants believe that the money to find at E. Masiul - EUR 90,000 - was R. Kurlianski's loan.
According to the case, over the edge of E. Masiul there are 242.4 thousand euros, 130 United Kingdom pounds sterling and 1.6 thousand US dollars.
E. Masiulis and his lawyer repeatedly tried to recover the money, but the courts rejected their requests.
Former policies have said that part of these funds belong to other persons and were intended to invest in real estate or are his family's money.
He also claimed that there was no data to make the funds available in a criminal way.
Previously, the Court of Appeal has announced that the allegations made by E. Masiu could be seen that these funds could have been received by receiving more than EUR 100 000.
Legal protection claims that the remainder of the net money taken over the fine could have been obtained from undetermined sources of income, undeclared, uncertified documents and perhaps no legitimate income.
In the case of political corruption, three legal persons have been charged - the Working Party, the Liberal Group, MG Baltic.
In addition to E. Masulio, the charges were filed against former "worker" Vytaut Gapsi, former liberal liberal Sharūn Gustaini, member of Seimas Gintar Steponavič and former MG Baltic Vice President Kurlianski.
Mr Kurlianski is accused of having given up former parliamentarians E. Masiuli, Mr Gustaini and Mr Gapsi.
The Americans recorded dangerous Russian destroyer maneuvers
During the 25-minute takeover, according to the U.S. Marine Force, the Russian SU-27 rushed directly through the plane.
The Russian aircraft went through it the second time, using the traction speed, and made a turn.
The passengers reported a feeling of turbulence during the first approach and an alarm during the second approach.
The Russian army has the right to practice in international airspace, but this interaction was irresponsible.
We look forward to international standards that ensure security and prevent incidents that correspond to behaviour, including the 1972 Convention on Marine Accidents and above the Prevention of the Sea (INCSEA), - in its report the U.S. Marine Forces said.
"Insecure actions increase the risk of miscalculation and potential conflicts", notes the report.
The Russian Ministry of Defence acknowledged the incident, but believed that the Russian SU-27 was "safe distance" from the American aircraft.
Parents’ expenses do not continue to decline: under-class activities only up to EUR 50 per month
According to a survey carried out by the market and public opinion research company "Baltic Studies", a survey conducted at the end of August revealed that a third (32%) of the parents of one school-age child before school had been awarded less than 100 euros, a fifth (21%) had been awarded from 101 to 150 euros, three out of ten (29%) - from 151 to 200 euros, and less than a fifth (18%) had been awarded more than 200 euros at the end of summer for one of their children.
Parents whose children started to go to first grade in this school year gave their child's school basketball an average of about 220 euros, while other parents whose children had already completed their first grade gave their child a lower amount - an average of about 160 euros.
However, there is no reduction in the cost of running away from school years, as parents often have to pay money for their children’s beards and hairdressers.
Depending on the nature of the occupation, the price of one barrel in the country may vary from 20 to 100 euros.
Parents who have children of school age were asked to tell what the average amount per month they plan to spend on their one child’s underemployment.
A quarter (23%) of the child surveyed planned to spend up to 20 euros per month, a quarter (26%) said paid up to 50 euros, three out of ten (31%) allocated to the child’s class employment from 50 to 100 euros per month, and a sixth (17%) of the parents indicated that they were planning to spend 100 euros or more.
True, in Lithuania children of school age are awarded an informal children's education basket, which is 15 euros per month.
However, this money can only be used for one board, and if the employment price is higher, the difference must be covered by the parents.
If a child attends a few bars or grows a number of school - age children in the family, the cost of post-mortem activities can be doubled.
As Vivus.lt marketing manager Justin Ambrasienė says, a small or medium-income family can save children's parents, especially when a number of children are growing up in the family.
At the beginning of the academic year, parents are turning their heads from where to get money for exercises, office goods, or new sports equipment.
Now the main concern is how to hire children after school without spending that burden.
We note that parents’ expenses are particularly increased in August when new years of science need to be properly prepared, but later they remain higher than in summer, because parents are willing to invest in their own jobs.
Often, in the lack of funds and in a responsible assessment of their potential, they are determined and borrowed," says J.Ambrasienė.

The Kaunas rejoices with the fourth tornado trolley
Today, the fourth exhibition of the mobile street in Kaunas is an exhibition "Atia Old, Good News" - an old trolley taken from the painting and inscription "Sienograph locks".
The city of Kaunas was reported to have a new happy trolley.
"This old "Skoda" also changed its somewhat refined green color into a much more colorful and brighter dress.
It also shows "Atia old, good news!" participant", - near the loaded photo written by representatives of the municipality.
Mobile street art shows "Atia old, good news" is intended to say goodbye to the old trolleys, which will be changed by the next year.
Already next year, the old "Skoda" trolleys will find rest, replace them with 85 new ones and modern "Solaris" trolleys.
The Portal recalls that the first trolley taken from the streets of Kaunas was taken out of the street months ago.
On the trolebuso a few well-known Kaunas street art accents - the old man's pipe and drum.
Not a week after the first appearance on Kaunas Street, the second street artist Timothy Norvilus - Morfai was born.
The sweet yellow car on the trolleybus, which is often just called "baby".
"You wanted to invite a trolley.
This drawing looks very pleasant, especially because it matches the trolleybus wheels.
When wheels turn on the wheel, it seems to be part of that car.
When we painted the wheels white, we made them look like retro-styles, it really shook the whole mix.
Until the trolleybus tyres were painted, it certainly didn't seem so wonderful," - as far as the portal kauna.diena.lt spoke the street artist.
On 27 October, a secret drawing was laid on the third trolleybus.
It is discolored in white, yellow, orange, red, but mostly blue.
This color is dominant.
On the left side of the trolleybus body is represented by one K.Doneliači g. home, on the right - central mail.
"Vabalas is my dearest friend so far," said Morpheus on the third trolley by the artist Morpheus.
New Pie
Kaunas Day recalls that last week Kaunas' public transport management company Kaunas bus with Polish company Solaris Bus & Coach S.A signed a 29.4 million contract that indicates that Kaunas buys 85 new trolley buses.
"The people throughout their history invest the largest amount for public transport renewal.
This contract will change the trolleys and offer the most comfortable services to all of us who have served for many years in Škoda.
New underground modern trolleys will have more seats, efficient living room conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver's workplace.
New technology and parallel work on the renewal of the contact network and road repair will allow trolleys to drive more safely, much faster.
And, of course, the trolleys of modern design make a great impression on the city," said Mindaugas Grigeli, Director-General of Kaunas Bus.
The first new trolleys will reach Kaunas next August, and all the old trolleys will be replaced by December.
Christmas sensation: Queen Elizabeth II invited Mother Markle together
Hercogiene Meghan has taken over the British Royal Chambers.
This proves the special gesture of Queen Elizabeth II: The British monarchy invited Doria Ragland, the mother of the Saxon Duke of Sandingham, to her chamber in the British media.
Such honor has not even been given to Kate's parents.
Kate’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton and other members of her family have so far been invited only to traditional Christmas prayers with the royal family.
The unnamed source of the newspaper Sunday Express revealed that the invitation to Doria Raglabd is the "sign of Queen's respect for Meghan".
He wants to be in the royal weddings on May, and he's taken the queen 'by his own silence.'
The invitation to celebrate Christmas together, in addition, has enriched the language that D. Ragland is planning a longer stay in Britain.
She's supposed to help her daughters before and after her birth.
Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, should be born in spring 2019.
In the "Balgir" arena and again the wormhole shows "Woman's World"
In the autumn and the brighter weather, for the 16th time the exhibition "Women's World" is already being prepared - women announce a long weekend, because even four days of hottest fashion, style and beauty news is already here - November 8-11, Kaunas "Zalgirio" arena.
Over the course of the year, to see how the event’s face changes, the exhibition means not just a series of purchases, but a tradition of giving time to itself.
Often this becomes the place of friends and the reason to spend the day with your sister or mother.
Four show-days have special power - every woman here can learn the secrets of magic, learn the tricks as they appear to light every day, find unchanged products, hear or test various procedures that stop the process of aging of the skin.
All this and more, it promises even 415 exhibition participants who will be waiting for visitors at all three arenas.
Three days will be held on the theme of beauty and health, and on Sunday, the representatives of the arts will be able to hear advice on the unique image of the mouth of Stylist and Internet writer Victoria Shoulyta.
A large part of women in business are faced with marginal situations where stress is affecting their stable emotional and physical state.
For this reason, Kaunas' Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Work and the Network of Business Women, was born with the idea of organizing a conference "Busli and Happy. Without stress", in which discussions and practical examples will help you in stressful situations and will encourage you to look at your life more creatively.
Like every year, I showcase events for the masters of beauty.
The exhibition's long-term partners, the Kirpei and beauty specialists' association, will provide the opportunity to learn two days of hair coloring and modeling subtilities from the International Academy of Winekourov & Friends - the Charizmatic Duet of S. Maslov and R. Sakalausko.
To further improve the field will be a competition for the development of the river entrance and the battle of masters "Art Battle", which will not remain questionable.
It is as if the dawn on the cake will become the festival of the beautiful world representatives "With birthdays, Lithuania", in which the occasion of the century will be possible to develop an unprecedented show - from body painting to dances.
Not to be forgotten is another tradition of Women's World - the latest collections of designers' Friday's fashion and beauty show, where they will choose the most stylish.
And handicrafts will be expected in the creative workshops of Dekostudia, where you can create the original interior of the house or more interesting decoration gifts.
On the last day of the exhibition, all longcases are especially expected, as traditional visitors will enjoy the competition "World Long-HAIRED WORLD 2018", where new longest cash records are recorded annually.
Prime Minister: The wage of teachers increased by 117 euros after the introduction of the flat-rate payment
From September onwards, the average remuneration of teachers in the whole of the country with a working load increased by 117 euros, says Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
"It is early to say how much it (in new order - BNS) has advantages or disadvantages.
The fact is that those who have a full workload - their salaries have grown by more than 117 euros on average," said S. Skvernelis to journalists in the government on Monday.
He called it "democracy law" to implement the plans of the Lithuanian Professional Union of Education Workers (LSDPS), but stressed that strike should not interfere with the education process.
"All forms of protest may be permitted in a democratic country.
If it is thought that it is necessary to strike, it is their right to decide.
You wouldn't want to see children in this place again, students.
If the strike is to be carried out, it must be carried out in accordance with the laws in force," said S. Quavernelis.
In June, Seimas approved the model of pay for the work of state teachers, which has been introduced since September.
The teacher's pay changed the hourly pay - the teacher's salary is 1512 hours a year.
The teacher’s working time is divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation and work for the community.
This reform, led by Andria Navicko, is called absurd, insulting the adoption of the "buldozer" principle and announcing an endless strike on 12 November.
LSDPS requires that this "minute" payout system be rejected immediately and that a flat-rate model be set up for up to 18 contact hours.
Also, official wage rates are increasing 20% and lowering the number of children in classes.
In addition to other innovations, a new methodology for the allocation of training funds has been criticised, since, according to the trade union, it is not enough for home training, for classes to be divided into groups, qualifications, education aid, and for classes in large cities as they have been.
The Ministry of Education and Science said that the state pay for teachers' work will regulate the workload of teachers and reward the school community for all its work.
It is expected that at the teacher's level the community will be able to make up up to half the number of hours per year, the first two years of work, up to 40% of all hours.
It is found that the teacher’s working hours per week are 36 hours, of which no more than 24 contact hours per week are required to train the subject(s).
In May, about half a hundred general washing schools, gardens and non-formal education institutions contributed to the two-hour strike launched by the LSDPS, about 1 thousand educators.
There are about 53,000 educators in Lithuania.
The call to be ready: crises can be expected within 2-3 years
The slowdown of economic growth and even crises can be expected within the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the Government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than ten years ago, in an interview with the "Zinijo radio" for the "Business position", said the President of the Board of the Lithuanian Bank.
"Saying that the crisis is already beyond the corner, I certainly cannot, but there are really signs of economic slowdown.
This year our country's economy has grown by more than 3 per cent, and we are planning an increase of 2.8 per cent next year.
The main message I would like to say to society and business - let's be ready for everything," said Vasiliuskas.
In his view, there are no equal crises and therefore they need to be prepared differently.
The difference from the crisis ten years ago is that the government at that time thought that the growing economy's income would be everlasting, and that was the result of the planned expenditure.
Therefore, in 2008, after the crisis, costs had to be drastically reduced.
Now, according to Vasilauska, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"It is true that the assessment of the situation of the Lithuanian Bank and the Ministry of Finance varies.
We believe that we are already beyond the potential and we need to press the brakes.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance does not care," said the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
The country's preparation for the upcoming crisis V. Vasiliuskas estimates 7 out of 10 points.
According to him, such a small and open economy as Lithuania is very important in external factors.
The current wave of big drums - the United States, China, the European Union - will no doubt blow us up too.
That is why we must be very careful.
When it is a small economy to say that we are deciding everything, it is possible, but I do not believe that," said Vasiliuskas.
What lies ahead for those who have borrowed large amounts of money?
According to Vasilausko, the European Central Bank has clearly set out a short-term strategy, and interest-change decisions can be expected not earlier than the next summer: "The main objective of this is to try to manage expectations."
The trend that is the biggest concern for the head of the Lithuanian bank is the reduction of labour in our country.
"The decline in labour labour force is largely leading to a reduction in economic competitiveness.
Moreover, this is a reduction in the eating of bread.
Migration this year has allowed some balance to this process, but it does not know whether it has been a long-term trend" - my V. Vasiliauskas.
ELTA recalls that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance predict that the country's economy will grow by 3.4% this year, with 2.8% next year.
The Swedish Conservative Leader will try again to form the government
The Swedish leader, who has been in the political unrest for two months after the elections, will be given a second opportunity to form the government, the President of Parliament announced on Monday.
Ulfo Kristerson (Ulfo Kristerson) is owned by the right-wing Alliance of the four centre parties, which received little less votes during the 9 September elections than the left-wing coalition of the centre.
The two blocs were hard to cope with by refusing to join the anti-immigration Swedish Democratic Party, which is the source of neo-Nation movement.
The first U.K. Kristerson attempt to form the government on October 14th was unsuccessful.
On 29 October, President Stefan Lofven (Stefan Lionen) announced the failure of his test.
In trying to force the parties to agree, Parliament President Andreas Norlen said that next week he would propose to Parliament Mr Kristersson as a candidate for the Prime Minister, thereby pushing the first vote since the government's efforts to form began.
"It is not clear in advance whether different parties will accept Ulf Kristerson as prime minister," said journalist A. Norlen.
However, he stressed that "the process must move forward and the dynamics between the parties must change".
"The negotiations must be concluded without delay," he added.
The date of Parliament's vote is not clear yet, but Mr Norlen said that between the possible dates is November 14th.
In Sweden, the President of Parliament may ask any candidate to form a government to which Parliament would agree four times.
If all four tests are unsuccessful, the country must hold new elections.
The current appointment of Mr Kristerson is the third test of Mr Norlene.
Some of the Independent Party and Alliance's Christian Democrats are pressuring U. Kristerson to accept the support of the extreme right Swedish Democratic Party, but he has so far rejected such an opportunity.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which received 17.6% of the votes during the elections and is the third largest party, ignores the long term of the main party.
The ultra-right party, having successfully taken advantage of the voter's anger over immigration after almost 400 thousand asylum-seekers had arrived in the country since 2012, requires influence in the decision-making of the exchange of support.
However, the members of the Alliance are categorically opposed to such ideas by liberals and centrists.
Since 2014, the Swedish Social Democrats' Working Party (SAP) has managed with the Greens and Non-Formal Left Support since 2014 provided opportunities for cooperation between the blocs, but only if it maintains the prime minister's position.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party rejected such an opportunity.
The Afghan Government delegation will participate in peace negotiations in Russia
The Kabul Government delegation will participate in international peace negotiations in Afghanistan, the officials announced on Monday in Russia this month.
The Taliban continues to consider whether to participate.
Russia announced on Saturday that it will hold such a conference in Moscow on 9 November, although the US is currently trying to negotiate bilaterally with the Taliban on the end of the 17-year-old conflict.
The Supreme Peace Council of the Afghan Government, responsible for meeting with the fighting effort, will send four representatives to Moscow, told the news agency AFP by representative Sayedas Ihsan Taheri (Sajidas Ihsan Taheri).
However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan has failed to respond to the call for a delegation to this conference, which will focus on the launch of peace negotiations between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still in agreement with Russian officials - said representative Sebaghtullah Ahmadi (Sebagtula Ahmadis). - We welcome any peace efforts led by Afghans.
Taliban representative Zabiullah Mujahid (Zabiula Mujahid) said that the movement still weighs on whether to go.
Moscow also invited representatives from the United States, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet Central Asian republics.
Pakistan, who has long been accused of supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan, "will necessarily participate", said the AFP, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Muhammad Faisalas (Muhamadas Faisalas).
The U.S. Embassy in Kabul has not yet responded to the request to comment.
The first meeting was planned in Moscow in September, but Kabului was postponed after calling for the process to be managed by Afghans.
The negotiations will take place at an early stage.
The newly appointed United States peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzadas (Zalmayus Chailzadas), is trying to persuade the Taliban to agree to negotiate the end of the war and is disappointed that a multilateral meeting in Russia could thwart these efforts.
One U.S. Government Supervisory Authority indicated last week that the Kabul Government has decreased in recent months.
The President of Cuba met with the leader of North Korea
The North Korean leader Kim Jong Unas (Kim Chen Unas) and the President of Cuba Miguel Diazas-Canelis (Migel Dias-Cane) agreed to expand and strengthen the strategic relations of their countries, the North Korean state media reported on Monday.
Mr Diazas-Canelis, who arrived in Asia on his first international trip after his arrival in power in April, will visit Pchenjan and his wife on Sunday.
He was met by Kim Jong Unas at the airport; together the leaders entered the city through the famous mines.
The North Korean state media reported that the leaders held negotiations at the State Guest House Paekhwawon, highlighted the socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not provide many details but indicated that the negotiating atmosphere was friendly.
The meeting with Kim Jong Unu could be seen as a warning to Washington, whose efforts to ensure significant progress on North Korea's denuclearisation are increasingly strict.
Pchenjan, who has recently also sought the favour of Moscow, is demanding a rhetorical meeting of US Secretary of State Mike Pompey (Maiko Pompey) and North Korea's chief negotiator Kim Yong Cholo (Kim Yong Cholo) in New York this week.
During the weekend, Pchenjan criticised the United States for the unenforceable sanctions - a political tool that Washington also widely used against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea is committed to further developing a nuclear weapons programme if Washington does not change its course.
The sanctions are an important issue on the agenda of Mr Diazo-Canal.
Last week, during a visit to Moscow, Mr Diazas-Canelis discussed the value of arms contract with Russia for almost $50 million (EUR 43.8 million) and received a similar promise by Vladimir Putin to expand political, economic and military relations.
At that time, both presidents issued a joint statement condemning the United States 'intervention in the internal affairs of sovereign states'.
The United States economic embargo on Cuba, originally introduced in 1958 and later extended, remains valid.
The sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union on Russia were imposed as a result of the Crimean annexation and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Mr Diazas-Canelis has to leave from Chenjan on Tuesday.
He will still visit China, Vietnam and Laos.

During the fire, the seventh high - flying wall was circled.
Record: Athletes in 157 Days Surrounded Britain
Britain’s athlete ran off from the sea on Sunday to the coast of England, becoming the first man to cross the coast of Great Britain.
For 33 years Ross Edgey (Ross Edges) spent 157 days in water and overcame 2,883 miles [2,883 km].
After six hours he sailed and was boarded by a crew escort.
In the last love, the athlete won the ride of hundreds of colleagues.
He landed on the coast in Margeite, which is where he started his trip on June 1st.
The athlete, who planned to sleep for 100 days, said to his trusted neighbors on the shore, "I'm sorry, I'm late."
He said that when he went to the shore, he first felt relief.
"I was very worried that my legs would not last," said the athlete.
The association of world swimming in open waters indicated that during this endurance test, which was supported by the producer of Red Bull energy drinks, R. Edgley had repeatedly encountered very adverse weather conditions, and even 37 times had to suffer from meds.
The organizers announce that Mr. Edgley has twice improved the longest record of sea breaks, which has so far been 73 days.
He also reached a new record, probably overcoming the distance between the southern and northern points of Great Britain - the Lands Endo Bay and John O'Groutso.
This distance was overcome by the athlete within 62 days.
Makabrika Kleboniški Forest Secret: One Suspect Already Detained
It was a dead end of the past, for the murderer was in a state of impatience.
Only under such circumstances was this crime known, for the murderer’s victim had no relatives and was not reported.
According to the original data, he was not too old to grow up.
Like the suspects of his murder.
One of them was arrested three months ago by the Kaunas District Court.
A second person who is likely to have fled to a foreign country where he is hiding from the punishment for another crime is still being sought.
Until it is found, lawyers are not inclined to comment more on the circumstances of this crime.
I. Valinskienė: I would agree with many of my children
The new building's rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" is nearing the expansion of the country's most prominent artists.
Inga Valinskienė is associated with the team of artists, which has been entrusted with one of the most important roles of the artist - a woman of course will play Juliet's hair.
The important part of the team also became Povilas Meškėla, who will take care of the song of the artists.
"I think love stories from Shakespeare have been created many and very beautiful, but "Romeo and Juliet", it seems, will always remain a symbol of these stories and will still be built on various scenes for a long time.
It will be interesting to become a part of such buildings," says I. Valinskienė.
Although a well-known woman is well-known in the scene, she has created not one role in various performances or musicals, the victims have not yet played her.
"The time to play Juliet has passed," laughed I. Valinskien.
- In my own time, I'd be happy to accept such a proposal."
True, the victim’s character in Shakespeare’s drama is no less important, some critics are even considered to be the most important.
The bride is not only an intermediary, a helper - her way and tone of speech, a feminine attitude to feelings and resulting solidarity with her loved ones gives more and more different colors.
In addition, it is also important because it is one of the only two women in the drama "Romeo and Juliet".
"A bird's character is not very close to my way and style, but sometimes it's just more interesting.
To create a different character than has a very important part of the creative process.
Until now, I don't know what the final result will be, because it will depend not only on me but also on the director's interpretation, - says I. Valinskienė and reveals that as a victim of Juliet's sacrifice, it would probably do the same.
- I think the kid was listening to his heart.
This is how most women behave.
That's probably what I would do."
The legendary opera "Love and Death in Veron" of the Battle of Kastus Antanelli is created by the famous drama "Romeo and Juliet".
In fact, the story of two young people - Romeo and Juliet - tells the story of love.
The sad end of history is not clear where the conflict between young families - the Montecas and the Capulets - arose.
"All history is possible at all times.
The parents who opposed the choice of children have always been and will always be.
Only today the solutions of such problems - diverse, - have been asked if today the history of Romeo and Juliet could repeat, says future cousin I. Valinskienė.
- On my own behalf, I would agree with a lot of people, as well as with the Marches."
The main role of the actor and director of Ramūn Cicēn's rock opera - Romeo and Juliet - will be Ieva Zasimauskaitė and Justin Jarutis, as well as the scene will show the Environment of the Cicēnas, Kęstutis Cicēnas, Mindaugas Papinigis, Marius Jampolskis, Paulius Shinkūns and Aidas Barkauskas.
The latest construction of the rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" will be presented to the audience at the end of December.
The first new-colored legendary works will be produced by Vilnius's "Siemens" arena viewers on 28 December.
A day later, on December 29th, the rock opera will be shown on the Klaipėda's "Swiss" arena.

Skamp presents a song that has already refused to show one TV
For the 20th year of operation, the group "Skamp" this year and again began to create music intensively.
On December 26, Vilnius Siemens staged the only anniversary concert "Skamp20", a three-year-old, after another, presented new works.
This time it's "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" and a bold song clip.
"This is about love, so I realized that the clip should also be intertwined with all types of relationships, regardless of age or sexual orientation," - the new song and video clip idea reveals Erica Jennings, who is convinced that any homophobia manifestation in 2018 is not normal.
The new songs "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" filmed over ten different orientations and age pairs: "We have always supported LGBTQIA communities and we believe that one day we will no longer have to discuss it," says Viktor Diawara, who created music at the beginning of the year during family vacations in Israel.
It is true that this video clip "Skamp" has already been able to respond negatively - it does not want to show one of the most popular shows in the country.
That's a lot to say about our society.
Television will not show a clip, because it has people fighting and it is not the wrong content for children.
And the fact that every day televisions can be used on screen with a mustache and other examples of violence is the right content?" - rhetorically asks E. Jennings.
Erica second and Willius Alessius: "I would like to see around more people who are struggling and promiscuous, regardless of their social status, gender or age.
We are raising children and we want them to grow in an environment where there is as much tolerance and as few as possible.
The new song and video clip we want to at least browse our listeners' day and give them a smile."
From 1998 onwards, the Skamp group played bold lyrics in which they spoke non-popular or opium themes.
The best of all groups - old and new - songs will ring loud and wide at the concert "Skamp20" already on 26 December.
It awaits everyone with their families, and children under 10 years of age are free of charge.

Presidency: LRT is not a political property
The Presidency is concerned that the rulers are simply seeking to gain more political control over the public broadcaster in order to address the findings of the Commission's research into the activities of the LRT.
"The public broadcaster is a non-political property, and the essential principle is that independence from politics is maintained," said President Mindaugas Lingė, "for the knowledge radio.
However, the consultant stressed that the opposite process can now be seen.
"It can be seen that those (political. - ELTA) influences want to have more.
This is and we appreciate it sufficiently critically," said Mr Lingė.
According to him, the proposals of the LRT Commission operating in Seimas are questionable and questionable because it applies to the independence of the broadcaster.
While Mr Lingė stressed the need to improve the governance of the LRT, it should be done on the basis of expert assistance and in the search for specific aspects of smooth LRT activities.
He stressed that the international authorities are already stressing that LRT activities should be supervised, not by the political but by the competent authorities.
On Tuesday, Seimas intends to take a decision on the findings of the Commission's investigation into the activities of the LRT.
These conclusions have been very critical.
The proposals to change the governance of the LRT are highly sceptical - reducing the powers of the Council and in connection with the mandates of its members with the mandates of the appointing authorities.
In view of this, the European Union of broadcasters has expressed concern.
The opposition group of Seimas appealed to the Constitutional Court in January on whether the special parliamentary commission to investigate the activities and finances of LRT is not opposed to the Constitution.
Workers abroad - good news from R. Karbauski
The Seimas began to consider the amendment of the Law on the Declaration of Living Place submitted by the Senior of the Lithuanian States and the Green Union Group, Ramūnos Karbauski, which provides that citizens working and paying taxes in non-Lithuanian countries would be exempt from compulsory health insurance payments.
The project was supported by 56 Seimas members on Tuesday, before the 9th session, 25 MPs were detained.
The draft is scheduled to be discussed at the Seimas plenary meeting on 6 December. The Seimas also decided to request the conclusions of the Government.
Under the proposed project, persons who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, in the European Economic Area States or in the Swiss Confederation shall be exempt from compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania by the decision of the Administration of the National Social Insurance Fund.
Living and working in non-Lithuania, according to the procedure laid down by the Board of the National Social Insurance Fund ("Sodra") and the State Tax Inspectorate, the data submitted and approved would be considered to have left Lithuania.
It's about services that people don't use.
Finding an additional opportunity to fix the fact that the man has left," explained R. Karbauski from the Seimas Tribune.
This proposed legal regulation, in the opinion of the Conservative of the Seimas, would be unfair to citizens living and paying taxes in Lithuania.
"Some Lithuanians living abroad abuse that," noted A. Matula.
Social Democrat Algird Sys believes that this is how we call on citizens not to respect their obligations.
In his opinion, the system of health protection for the wise would be provided free of charge.
On adoption of the proposed amendment of the law, persons who have moved to other countries shall be paid social security contributions, non-debt debts, the burden of managing Sodro's debt.
At present, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania, but have not declared their departure in the Register of Citizens, are charged monthly compulsory health insurance (PSD) contributions and, if they are not paid, debt is accumulated.
A. Duonela is convicted of fraud, but justified for fraud
The Vilnius District Court has left the sentence for adjudication to mislead the former famous sportsman Alvyd Duondė, but he is justified on the basis of the falsification of the documents.
The verdict published on Monday came immediately.
A. Duonėla was sentenced to imprisonment for half a quarter of the year in which the sentence was suspended.
This year, the Lithuanian fear champion was tried by the Vilnius District Court.
He was sentenced to six months ’ imprisonment.
While the case was investigated by the judge, the Vilnius District Court dismissed one charge, but the sentence remained the same.
The former athlete will also have to pay almost EUR 760 for the Offensive Crime Fund.
Prosecutor A. Duondėla accused him of falsifying a wallet in 2013, which he borrowed 200 thousand litres (about 58 euros) from his former wife, Dalios Burokaitė.
The couple learned about this only in December 2016 when they were invited to cover the debt.
The former spouse said that he had never borrowed from his husband for the purpose of the money clinic and that he had never found a wallet.
According to the opinion of the Vilnius District Court, there is no objective evidence in the case that it is precisely A. Duonėla that it is not true that UAB "Delezia" owes A. Duonėla 200 thousand litas.
Consistent with the arguments set out in the complaint by the prosecutor and his defendant, there is no supporting objective data in the case.
In this way, when it was found that A. Duonėla had only used a fake true document for fraud and admitted that these features - the use of a fake document - are a complex part of fraud (in the present case - the fraud of fraud), A. Duonėla is justified in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Criminal Code, without proof that he was involved in committing a criminal act", - it is written in Vilnius County Court's judgment.
The firemen led the dead cats on the ground, and they heard the sound of the trumpet for three days.
As reported by the Kaunas District Fire Safety Board, a report was received that three days had passed since the boilers were replaced.
The firemen also heard the cat’s crack.
It was explained that some days ago the heat road repair works were carried out here.
It is likely that two cats could have been closed on the ground during the road after the overcrowding.
The heat from the track, which is half a meter deep, was fired by the firemen and thrown into the hole for the cats.
Antonino Scalia’s son claims that his father’s unscrupulous liberal protests about Kavanaugh’s
The son of Judge Antonino Scalia of the Velionio Supreme Court told Fox News on Sunday that his father would not be surprised by the extreme force protest against the nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh because Scalia believed that the Supreme Court was too involved in the affairs of the modern world.
"In general speaking, he would be very uneasy about the nomination to the Supreme Court, because much is based on Roe's anti-Wade case – at least as far as the left is concerned –," said Christopher Scalia, recalling a landmark case in 1973, after which the constitutional right of women to abortion was established in certain trimesters.
In Roe's case, the right of all states to regulate abortions themselves was removed and some States, in response to this decision, immediately tried to restrict the right to abortion.
"My father often said that Roe v. Wade and in other cases the court actually tried to solve cultural problems, although they had to be resolved through the election and legislative publishing process," he added through the presentation in Fox & Friends."
"By attempting to speed up the trial, the Supreme Court has caused even more damage, so nominations to the Supreme Court and disputes about approval have led to a more severe reaction, as judges have a role to play in lawmakers."
In this month's meeting of the Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse expressed a similar opinion on the approval of Kavanaugh, repeating that the Congress often gives too much power to executive authorities who are essentially unaccountable and leaves the resulting bureaucratic issues before the Supreme Court and therefore the judges have to take the work that the senators refuse.
The Capitol Mountain Police arrested and accused hundreds of protesters for illegal interference with the candidate's approval process.
Asked whether Kavanaugh could avoid adverse reactions due to unconfirmed allegations of sexual misconduct that he had committed a few decades ago, Scalia said she would probably not be able to avoid noise.
Responding to statements that Kavanaugh should not go to the Supreme Court because on Thursday the senators had responded hotly and sometimes indisputably, Scalia questioned whether all judges were of a peaceful nature.
"The judges are often confused," Scalia said when she spoke about the bad disagreements that sometimes arise in conflicting cases.
"True, Judge Kavanaugh must have reacted more aggressively, but that was different.
He tried to defend his good name from unconfirmed accusations."
On Thursday, a majority of the party’s votes (11 to 10) were allowed to participate in the entire Senate’s vote.
In a dramatic moment, Senator of the Arizona Republics, Jeff Flake, stated that he would only surrender his decisive vote to Kavanaugh if the FTB would be given a week to investigate the alleged violations of the current allegations to Kavanaugh.
The investigation is still ongoing and President Short said that the Agency has broad powers and can question "just as it wishes".
“Schiaparelli” ready-made clothing collection – fantastic finishing
Is Surrealism Possible?
Schiaparelli tried to answer this question.
Paris’s fashion house, set up almost a hundred years ago by Elsa Schiaparelli, presented its first collection of ready-made clothes and gloves.
This collection is almost as incredible as the famous Elsos Schiaparelli converts into a kepuratė.
The eccentric image of the long-changing fashion house appeared this time and how modern.
In aesthetic solutions you will find sensations, tumours, hearts and eyes.
Schiaparelli created his first combination in 1930 and was the first designer to walk through the podium.
She and her friend Salvador Dali planned to reconcile art and fashion, and now Calvin Klein and Rafas Simons, who are working with US artist Sterling Ruby, took over this idea.
The clever legend is that Dali, together with Schiaparelli, and the Omar-shaped evening dress before the demonstration, wanted to cast a true mayonnaise, but did not wait for approval.

"We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation, which is not separate from the story of Schiaparelli," said Bertrand Guyon, who has been working with the creative director for the last three years, speaking at the fashion hall in Vandamo.
He supported Schiaparelli in association with My Ray and worked with My Ray's Fund to create clothes based on well-known works of art.
A picture of the eyes of the artist's close-up "glass tears" is shown on the shirts covered with Perspex tears and the red lips from "Observatory Time: Lovers" are printed on a real silk suit with a collage.

One of Elsa's beauty was a pleasant attraction to the writing of S. Her corporate color – "Soccurring pink" inspired her breath "Soccurring".
The first hand of Guyon's creation "Schiaparelli" with a key split on the handle called "The Secret".
Its retail price will also be fantastic – 5000 £.
Yesterday in the Old Left Coast, a temporary shop was opened where the Siurrealist Paris Fashion Week half was demonstrated and for 100 € could be purchased from the Ikea collection of Virgil Abloho.
After half an hour before the opening, more than 500 young Abloho fans sprang up on the cover without trying to buy one of his works at a more favourable price than created by Louis Vuitton men's clothes.
Ablohui this project helps to reach a wider audience than the one available for luxury fashion or furniture designed by designers.
“No one has any property anymore, but knowledge of a certain chair can help to set up a conversation at the southern table.
That's what a thousand-year-old thinks," he recently said.
The audience in the Marais area realized that this event in the garage would not be the norm when the models began to drive through them on wheels.
The collection of men and women’s colourful, free-at-cooled men and women’s screens by Viviens Westwood’s designer Andreas Kronthaler was supported by portraits of the Riedlents of Jessicos Fulford-Dobson Cabol.
Some women who were surrounded by high - sounding sandals (and several men) drove on wheels, but the sweating platform of the floor was on their own.
Westwood, after watching the show in the first row and wearing a collection dress with horse motifs and an orange bounded cardigan, joined her husband for the last silence on the podium, giving her a flower bouquet.
Strong doubles in photos
Detroit was born and Peter Zelewskis, who lived in London, had already been established as a street photographer when he began to photograph twice four years ago.
"As a portrait photographer and man, I think there have always been twins and their extraordinary connections, which everyone is talking about," he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the whole project, however, he says, “after photographing the first two portrait I gained independence and was no longer on the way back”.
The book "Dwynjai" will soon appear in the book "Dwynjai" to print 44 identical two pairs of photos and stories.
This project is more visual, he says: "It's not a documentary or scientific project – I wanted to photograph influential and sensitive portraits of people."
Employees expressed a lack of confidence in the trade union, which led to negotiations on wages
Members of the Royal Care College, who were not satisfied with the trade union transaction with the National Health Service on wages, expressed distrust after the vote and accused her of misbehaving about the expected increase in wages.
This unprecedented decision was taken after long discussions at the Royal Care College, when his former Secretary-General, Janet Davies, wrongly promised members that their salary would rise immediately this year by 3% when the 1% pay limit will be lifted.
When the expected salary was lifted, the members took up and forced Davies to resign, then filed a petition and held a meeting on Friday in Birmingham, after which the college board expressed their distrust.
"The fair and open debate in Birmingham has helped to clarify the relationship, so the college will only strengthen," said Maria Trewern, Director of the Royal Service College.
“The vote was clear and the Council of the Royal Service College and the management understood the message sent to it.
In recent weeks, the Council has already made changes in the organisation and has tried to listen to the words of the members and include them; we will continue our efforts to implement them."
The meeting will be held next week and is expected to be held by members of the Governing Body of the Kingdom Ministry.
"The basis of the service is trust," said Guardian of the National Health Service.
"The actions of the Royal College of Care Council have undermined its confidence and the Council must therefore withdraw.
I hope that she will honor and listen to the request.
It is interesting whether members of other trade unions will also seek reform."
In August, Rachel Harrison said: "The National Health Service staff received salaries from the National Health Service from all over the country, without realizing the expected rise.
That's why they're upset."
Prior to the extraordinary meeting, the Royal College of Care acknowledged that it had made mistakes in the negotiations on rewards in 2018 and had misinformed about them.
However, it is also said that the Royal Care College's campaign on the abolition of pay restrictions forced the government to renounce this restriction and to promise to increase salaries by 6.5% over three years.
The vote took place after an independent investigation which found that the college was willing to engage in negotiations and that Davies was accused of not having carefully assessed the transaction.
It is said that the Royal College of Care provided information that was not consistent with the facts and therefore the members could not take a reasoned decision on the transaction and did not consider alternatives.
The College issued conflicting information on whether all employees would receive 3% increase in wages.
In the short report before the college's introduction, representatives were mistakenly told that the planned "3% increase and rise in the phase-out of reform".
In fact, wages should have been gradually raised to 3% and only some of the employees receiving the highest wages would have been immediately increased.
"Almost all the information provided to post-entry members about the implementation of the transaction was wrong (probably because it was being tried to simplify it)," said a representative of the Electoral Reform Service who conducted the investigation.
‘ERS considers that the decision-making countries did not understand and explain clearly the differences between the existing system and the proposed transaction and the unexplained main advantages, including the 6,5 % and 29 % calculations mentioned during the campaign, and therefore it was not possible to take a reasoned decision.’
78% of the voters voted in favour of the decision and 3.74% of the members of the Royal Care College took part in the vote.
Lindsay Lohan shocked the viewers of the "Instagram" live broadcast by trying to "capture" children from the family
Lindsay Lohan was criticised for the direct broadcast of Instagram, through which she followed the homeless family on the street and tried to separate her sons from her parents.
Direct broadcasts, probably filmed in Moscow (according to Lohan's earlier updated Instagram story), initially offered to provide a place for the family, but the situation quickly complicated.
“Good for all! I want to show which family I have agreed to,” she told the viewers, “these refugees from Syria, I am very concerned about them.
They really need help.
Do you want to come with me?
Let's go, I'll take care of you," she said to her family before going to one of the children: "Would you like to stay at the hotel?
Watch the movies?
It would be nice to watch a movie on TV or a computer."
When his parents refused, Lohan reacted in a negative way.
"Your children should not be on the street, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
"If anyone offers them houses and a place of night as I am now, you should agree.
They're coming back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't joke with me."
When the family tried to leave Lohan by going off the street, the actor followed her directly through Instagram.
“Look what’s going on is trade in children. That’s how you fuck Arab culture.
Take your children, even though they don't want to go with you.
Guys, don't worry, I'm with you and now the whole world sees us."
The transmission ended in a physical confrontation – it seems that Lohan's mother broke.
The video was broadcast on social media, and some users were interested in whether this could not be comparable to the attempt to capture.
The Independent contacted Lohan's representative for comments.
A third of the British believes he'll never pay all the debts he has.
Nearly a third of the British believe that they will not be able to cover their debts during their lifetime, and one in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
A study conducted by Equifax and Gorkana, which revealed only The Independent, showed that the British, especially members of the 18-24-year-old group, believed that they would have a debt for their whole life, and only half of them expected to get rid of it.
Last year, the report published by the Institute of Fiscal Studies states that students who have graduated from school remain in debt of approximately £46,000, while the poorest students remain in debt of more than £57,000.
Most graduates (81 per cent) will never pay all the debts, so the first 30 years will be forced to work.
Public debt is growing: According to data from the Department of National Statistics, United Kingdom family debt is a record size and British spends on average $900 per year more than earnings.
However, is it worth worrying about this frightening statistics?
Is the debt of all ages simply a new common way of life for young adults (and for society as a whole)?
As an example, cars that are another major buyer are purchased from the home (if such a success occurs).
Auto Trader predicted this week that in ten years all new cars will be purchased in full – this will be the usual means of purchasing vehicles.
EQ Investors Director and certified financial planner Jeannie Boyle believe that expectations have really changed.
“In these times, it’s really normal to have debts: credit cards, unpercentage refinancing, student loans and quick loans,” she said.
"Our ancient generations were ashamed to have debts."
In these times the debt of students and housing prices has become a normal phenomenon.
This statement is also supported by the Head of the Personal Finance Department of the Interactive Investor Moira O'Neill, who believes that the results can cause concern.
"If you borrow a large amount that exceeds your income four or five times, it may appear that additional debts are nothing," she explained.
And that's how people get into trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so people with large loans or other debts have to think about what would happen if the rates were to rise."
It should probably not be observed that there is no doubt about the comments of the financial industry.
Brian Brodie, Managing Director of the Credit Agency for Freedom Finance, says: "Schools are not taboo.
Loans for home repair or new car purchases are no longer held at the last exit.
Low interest rates have helped many people to save their time-consuming deposits, which generate higher returns, but are not so easy to achieve saved money.
As a result, the middle class is increasingly borrowing.
In the last six months, about half of the new loans have been taken by customers with excellent credit ratings."
Richard Haymess, head of the TDX Group’s Financial Problem Management Department, Equifax, believes that such expectations – and not all life’s debt – are a real cause of concern.
He says: “Frequent inflation was the highest in six months (2.7%), interest rate rose, and the earnings increased little, so it is not a matter of many people’s decision to borrow without a realistic plan of how to repay debts.
Our analysis has shown that this year the number of bankrupt persons will increase by 17 per cent, and the main factor is the record lending of consumers."
Debt may not cause much anxiety as long as a person works and earns, but it is not clear how unearned debt will affect his well - being in old age.
The study of the Centre for Economic and Business Research carried out in conjunction with the lending of funds for invested assets by experts from More 2 Life showed that people's undeclared debt over the last four years has grown by more than a third, i.e. more than twice as fast as the country's average.
This age group usually borrows through credit cards and spends 30 percent more each month than earnings.
Boyle adds: “More and more people are choosing to pay their pension from pension funds at 55 years of age, and this will affect their life in retirement.
It is usually the only savings that they had to save.
In addition, people think that the use of wealth will go away later, but if they change their assets, they do not get as much money as they can expect.
If the price of the property falls, this situation will only become difficult."
Serena Williams, who was tortured to death, sang "I Touch Myself" to draw attention to breast cancer
Serena Williams released a video in which she sings the classic "Divinyls" song with the hands of "I Touch Myself" with her leg.
The teniso axis was split into a clip on its Instagram page and explained that the video was designed to encourage women to check their breasts themselves.
"I wrote this month of the "The Divines" World Hit "I Touch Myself" to remind women to regularly check themselves," Williams wrote.
"So I left my comfort zone, but I wanted to do so because this problem affects women of all races around the world.
The most important thing to do as soon as possible is to save many lives.
I hope I can remind women of this."
Williams continued: “This music clip is part of the project “I Touch My Self Project”, which is carried out in the honor of the famous Chrissy Amphlett – she died of breast cancer and gave us her hit to remind women of first care for her health.”
The project is supported by the "Berle for Breast Cancer Network Australia" (BCNA) brand started in 2014 after the death of Amphlett.
The video released by the tennis star in his Instagram account has received more than 1.5 million reviews and many sick people's compliments for how the tennis player has sung the song.
“The greatest pleasure for this moment and your courage to do so.
Thank you, Serena," wrote one admirer.
Another added: “Serena, that’s not true.
20 years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer, and I detected a lump myself, even when the mammograms showed nothing.
It is simply necessary to verify.
Thank you for not being afraid to leave the comfort zone – you're a real dame!"
The Berlin project "I Touch Myself Project" also released a new sign of live skin "The Chrissy", inspired by the rock star.
100 percent of the profits received after the sale of the box will be sacrificed by BCNA.
It is important to know the signs and symptoms of self-testing.
The signs of breast cancer are not only small but also altered breast size or shape, rashes or wounds, isolated from the spines, swelling of the skin surface, permanent pain or changes in the skin texture.
In addition, cancer can be reported by swelling to the wound or the key, the swelling of the veins and the swelling of the spine.
Women are advised to check their breast every month.
If you notice any signs of breast cancer, NHS recommends that you contact your family doctor immediately.
If you have been examined by your family doctor, your symptoms should be further evaluated, he will send you to a breast cancer clinic.
Adam Driveris forced the entire SNL filming group into the quota
Adam Driver was this week's "Saturday Night Live" guest star and actually tried to cheer everyone up.
The best songs are often not related to a specific event – like a new exhibition called "The Day of the Year".
A U.S. high school day is seen when students bring their fathers up, and a teenager Mortdecai (Pete's Davidson) reluctantly agrees that his father, the old oil magnet Abraham H. Parnassus (Adam Drive), would speak.
In Lazdela, the restless Parnassus, whose megalomanic personality could inspire Daniel Day-Lewis's actor Daniels Plainviews from the movie "Bush Blood", is depicted as mastering the oil industry.
"I was born seven months early," Parnassus told his students.
“Incubator technologies were just invented, so I was put in a pot of cheese and heated in a pizza oven until I learned to walk.
My bones have not grown old, but my spirit is not in me.
Be strong and shake your enemies!"
Davidson and his colleague SNL actor Aidy Bryant, acting as a teacher, are a bit unremarkable and cannot look into the driver’s eyes.
However, the characters of the Star Wars are only running away and he is starting to say about the personal war with another oil magnet, H. R. Pickins.
"I know your ring!" he boasts.
"I have filled her belly with my straining seed, and I have corrupted your boy: this is my final blow, H. R.!"
In less than five minutes, the peer became the same reminder of Adam’s driver as Kyle Rena from two films.
"Fuck you, H.R.!"
Killed by Kendrick Lamar: Eight Unheard Songs appeared on the Internet
It seems that a lot of Kendrick Lamaro's songs were lost.
On Saturday, eight of them were still not listening to the songs the parties challenged by SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay's Rock, Isaiah Rashadas and Abis Soulas.
It is not clear where the songs came from, and the title of the set “Bad Kid Chill City EP” and the illustration of the top (probably created by the fans) are not official.
Only demonstrative and unfinished versions of songs that sound as if they were recorded at different stages of the Lamaro career can be lost.
Gang Member could belong to the Good Kid Maad City era, and Heroin, sung together with the SZA, is similar to the song "DAMN./Black Panther".
The following songs shall be distributed on the market:
‘Gang Member’;
‘The Only Nigga’;
'Want In Life';
"Loved Ones" (with SZA);
Own This City;
‘Heroin (with SZA, Jay'umi Rocku, Isaiah Rashadu and Ab Soul)’;
"Look Over Your Shoulders" (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson);
"Swimming Pools Alternative".
The Independent contacted the representative of Kendrick Lamar for his comment.
Interview about the music "Chikaga": There are no tickets left in Klaipėda, invites to go to Vilnius or Kaunas
Lithuanians want to see Klaipėda's state music theatre music "Chikaga" - does not pray.
For this reason, the most popular Lithuanian musician of all time has set up another tour over the country's largest arena.
However, after about 1.5 months before the show, the halls are packed.
The organizers announce that all tickets have already been sold to the music in Klaipėda's "Swiss" arena, and the tickets are quickly dissolved in Kaunas' "Zalgirio" and Vilnius's "Siemens" arenas.
There are no more tickets in the city for some time, so all those who want to see this indisputable music, we invite you to go to Kaunas or Vilnius, where there are some more tickets.
The demonstrations will take place in December, so not only will our music continue to be seen, but it will also have a great opportunity to look at the eglutes of the largest cities in the country," – the music fans will be offered by Klaipėda’s head of state theatre Laima Vilimienė.
The audience of Chicago in December will see how much the composition of the artists has changed.
One of the main roles of the music was first entrusted to the actor Tom Giaub.
The talented and well-known actor from TV screens in Chicago will be the unrepeatable Billy Flynn - the best and most influential Chicago lawyer, with no eyeballs changing people's fate.
Since Klaipėda's state music theatre music "Chikaga" is adapted to larger spaces, arenas, the composition of artists showing it is also larger than the works shown in Broadway.
In the Lithuanian "Chicago" there are half of the artists on the horse.
The main roles of women are to trust the wonders of Klaipėda State Music Theatre Solist Beatai Ignatavičiūt (killed Velma Kelly) and the charismatic Kaunas Music Theatre Solist Gabriel Bielskyte (killed Roxie Hart).
The Chicago music depicts the criminal world of Chicago in the third decade of the 19th century, which turns the prison walls into a mountain of stars.
It's a piece of music of criminal justice telling about two killers seeking attention and recognition.
The music is repressed by sexuality and irony.
No matter where or what the main heroes - Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly - the meaning of life - would be to shine on the bright star.
Their life is life because of the message on the first page, because of the title, the flashlights, the glory of the olive tree...
On December 13, Chicago will be displayed in the Klaipėda "Swiss" arena, on December 18, in the Kaunas "Zalgirio" arena, on December 20, in the Vilnius "Siemens" arena.
The ticket's called "Ticket."
Website furniture in Kaunas
The website can be called a representative home area where we spend time with friends, guests, and so on. Therefore, it should be arranged in such a way that it is convenient not only for the owners of the apartment or home but also for the guests.
Depending on the size of the site, the walls, ceiling decorations and the taste of the owners, appropriate furniture should be selected.
The site should be not only beautiful but also convenient.
Best help to invite an interior designer, which will help to optimally fill the space so that it is not overloaded or vice versa - too empty.
It is advisable to first set out the main point of the site, i.e. the item to which you combine furniture, other details.
This may be a box or other important accent of the site interior.
It would also be great to have a conversation area where guests could communicate comfortably so as not to interfere with non - local furniture.
Sofos, chairs should be set close to each other so that your guests can sit down and talk.
So the layout of the furniture should encourage communication, unite people, not distance them from one another.
Don't push the furniture next to the wall.
The size of the room depends on the distance from the walls.
Although the room is small, at least a few places away from the wall, do not attach the furniture to it.
If the room space is large, leave even more space from the walls.
Actually, the longer the distance, the better.
When the furniture is installed, keep the balance.
Consider the various details that will be on your website.
All elements must agree on each other.
The site furniture must be compatible with the interior details.
A possible low contrast.
He will survive the site's interior, but it shouldn't be too big, because the interior will become worthless.
We always advise to consult with interior designers.
By creating the site itself, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you are at risk of diverting to extremes: or you create an internal barrier because you are afraid to experiment, err, choose improperly, or try to improvise.
Appropriate lighting
This is a very important thing.
The different light reveals the space differently.
The lighting shall be set at different levels: ceiling lamps, wall lamps, on the floor of the lamps.
The Prosecutor’s Office has challenged the ruling on the LCF’s leaders
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office has denounced the judges of the Vilnius District Court of Justice who had been sentenced to death by the former Lithuanian Federation of Cartons (LKF).
As the prosecutor's office reported on Monday, the complaint states that the municipality of the city of Panevėž did not have a legal basis for contributing to the reconstruction of the private hotel in Panevėž.
In the pre-trial investigation, it was found that, in order to find the possibility to finance the reconstruction of the hotel, a public procurement and sale contract between the Lithuanian basketball federation and the municipality of Panevėži was concluded in 2010.
The prosecutors claim that part of the services to be provided by the Federation under that contract to the municipality of Panevež city had already been received or planned for the provision of services, part of the planned events had already taken place before the signing of the contract and had already been paid out of other funds, and part of the events had taken place after the invoices of VAT accounts had been issued - the money has been transferred to the invoices for the events not yet taken place.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor’s Office argues that the judgment of the Court of First Instance does not support the conclusion that the State itself has committed and ordered the municipality of the city of Panevež to undertake the reconstruction of a private hotel, since there was no State obligation for a particular hotel, but only a proposal for the municipality of Panevež to resolve the hotel development issues needed for the championship as soon as possible.
In the opinion of the Prosecutor's Office, the Court found that the LKF and the mayors of the municipality of Paneveži tried to comply with the State's obligation without having any legitimate grounds for showing that there was an opportunity to organise competitions in other cities by the European basketball championship group, without prejudice to the law.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office appeals to the Court of First Instance for the annulment of the judgment and in this case for the adoption of a new - defendant - judgment on seven natural persons and one legal person.
On October 15th, the Vilnius District Court fully upheld the LCF Secretary-General Mindaug Balčiūn for all crimes committed.
This case relates to the preparation for the European Men's Cartoon Championship in Lithuania in 2011.
Mr. Balčiūn was charged with abuse, fraud and other crimes.
The Office of the Attorney-General, Mr Balčiūnas, accused him of having agreed on behalf of the federation with the finance manager and executive director on behalf of the federation to write down acts of transfer of non-compliance - and other financial documents and accounts relating to services provided to the municipality of Panevėži.
According to a case-by-case study carried out by the Special Investigation Service (STT) of the Paneveži Board officials, the City of Paneveži City funds could have been faked and faked for the benefit of LKF managed and later used by Via Unica for the reconstruction of the Romantic Hotel.
This hotel manager Dalia Kuklierienė accused of paper - she is suspected of giving television to Mr. Balčiūn as a kiss.
All the persons who are entitled to justice with Mr. Balčiūn.
The allegations in this case were made to eight natural persons and to one legal person - the Lithuanian basketball federation.
Remote Workplace - Like Bermuda Triangle
The number of people injured or killed in Lithuania from 1992 to now has already exceeded the total number of people living in Alyta and reaches about 83 thousand.
If the specific physical workplace and its safety requirements are as clear as they are, the choice to work remotely from home, public spaces or even from other countries becomes the new Bermuda triangle.
According to insurance professionals, although the Workers' Safety and Health Act provides for remote workers to create safety and health conditions that are not different from those of other companies, the variety of modern forms of work may raise a number of questions, the press report states.
In the event of an accident in the home, the employer pays compensation for the first two days of unemployment from 80% and for the rest of the period is Sodra.
If it is found that an accident occurred at work, from the first day of unemployment, Sodra compensates 100% of the wage.
The assessment of the statistics submitted by the State Labour Inspectorate and the injury to BTA is clear that the absolute majority of accidents and various injuries at work occur at the workplace.
Most of these are various physical works, where the risk of damage is higher: unbiased handling of devices or equipment, loss of concentration or coordination.
However, the offices where most of the most inquiring, the best-paying specialists are now concentrated also face their own challenges that employers face, and the freedom of mobility that employees particularly enjoy," says BTA Head of Human Resources Management Jevgenija Krisčiūnė.
The legislation in force in Lithuania recommends a clear regulation of the employee's duties and limits of liability, the definition of working time, place and functions, which also applies in the form of a remote job.
If so, it is easier to determine whether an accident occurred at work or not.
There are truly different situations and nuances, each case being dealt with individually.
Employers are often heard of the employer’s responsibilities, such as going to work or from work or traveling to or from work meetings for accidents.
However, there is a very large number of nuances and reservations in this case, so I would encourage both workers and employers to initiate talks, to find out and to make it clear, as clearly as possible and as acceptable to both sides, what situations are actually considered to be accidents at work, and to which the status of domestic trauma will already have to be." - expert advises.
Mr Krisčiūnė says that during these times, when work functions are often fully sufficient for a computer and mobile phone and a stable internet connection, the employee will not necessarily work at the place and at the time specified in the agreement.
Workers are mobile, they can then choose to work at home instead of at home, while listening to coffee in the cafe or in the park enjoying the sun.
Is this going to be a job or not?
What if the working hours still under discussion are not in accordance with the agreed agreement?
It is possible to encounter truly non-constant situations, the circumstances of which help to clarify the circumstances of the investigation, the launch of "Sodros" or State Labour Inspections", says the expert.
In its view, the main difference in financial terms between the event’s work and the home is the amount of the unemployment benefit.
J. Krisčiūnė admits that there was an informal hearing of unpleasant experiences when employers try to hide the real circumstances of accidents or trauma and try to persuade employees to contact doctors at work, to take responsibility for themselves, thus making money.
This is a dishonest, disrespectful attitude toward the employee and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of the people already mentioned encourages the search for additional instruments that could help businesses in similar situations: the insurance of civil liability of the employer for injury to workers, the acquisition of accident insurance from injury, disability or even death, as well as the insurance of current and health", says J. Krisčiūne.

Lithuanian Regby Collection - Volkswagen Lessons
The Lithuanian Regby election, which is the debut of the European Trophy division, has so far been difficult to compare with higher-level competitors.
The Trophy Division in the Old Land is the third according to the capacity of the Six Nations tournament and the European Championship.

In the first row, the Lithuanians had to play without a yellow card.
In the second row, the guests made several attacks, but they failed to finish them successfully.
At that time, the Poles were able to break up the defense of the Muslims.
Cumulative pressure in the accounting area was performed by Mateusza Plcht, later by Kristian Pogorzelski and Mateusza Adamski.
In addition to several important conductors, Lithuanian election coach from PAR Ntando Manyosha acknowledged the advantages of the competitors and said that such games provided a lot of valuable experience.
"Length played very well and dominated all the game components.
Our goal was to stay as long as possible in these games.
We just got up to this higher level and we need to understand it.
We won the first games against the Czechs, but now we met very powerful competitors and had to acknowledge their advantages.
Polish electorate has given us useful lessons," said a specialist from PAR, to stand by the Lithuanian electorate for four years.
Another match "Trophy" division Lithuanians will play on 6 April 2019 at home with Portuguese or Romanians.
The Dutch and Swiss teams are still competing in this division.

Japan’s Coast Guard is actively searching for poor islands
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - this name was given to all smaller islands in northern Japan in 2014.
A small, insignificant and valueless island, which was essentially unfit for life, was of great importance to Japan.
So important that the territory now covered by it is closely monitored - perhaps it will still occur?
Why does Japan need this island?
You won't.
It is likely that the ice and the underwater debris have flown over this island all the time, even though it has been well over the water surface for almost two metres.
There is little doubt that the island simply breaks down, but at least its trails are expected to be found.
When the island began no one knows exactly - it was so worthless that no one was too much of it and did not.
Probably the first ones about Esanbe Hanakita Kojima were the first Japanese fishermen to learn about the island, who sometimes used it as an aid for visual navigation.
Their disappearance is not even a tragedy for these fishermen because there are better ways to capture where fishing can take place and where the Russian waters begin.
That was the meaning of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima.
This narrow strip of land was the western slopes of the Kurilian island.
This island chain, known by Russia as the Kuril Islands, and Japan as the Northern Territories.
The conflict with such interruptions has continued since the mid-19 ’ s, but the full force was absorbed in the 20 ’ s.
There are natural resources in these areas, but historically Japan believes that the islands should belong to it.
The point is that the Japanese have been studying these islands since the mid - 17th century.
They were the first to make a map, and they did more research, registering many small halls.
The agreements signed between Japan and Russia in 1855 indicated that the former belonged to Sachalin and Japan to all the Kuril Islands.
So these two states lived until 1905, when the Russian Empire lost Sachalin in the war for Japan.
In 1945 the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and opened up the Kuril Islands.
Japan, however, does not mean much about the island, although it was the first, but would like to have four islands - Iturupo, Kunashio, Shikotan Islands and Chabomajas.
Japan feels that it has a historic right because the islands were the first to examine and belong to Japan under the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan offered to Russia these four islands to be divided in a level, but Russia did not even consider adopting such a proposal.
Japan is quite close to the Northern Territories, but now the islands are beginning to have lost this geographical link.
This physical sign of Japan's presence in those waters was missing.
This is a major loss, which is why the island remains sought.
However, even if they are found in Esanbe Hanakita Kojima, they will not meet the definition of a simple island - it must be dry.
This means that there will be a slight decrease in the Japanese territory and a strong decrease in the exclusive economic zone, which will be calculated from the borders.
I'm just wondering what you're expecting from the island search mission - that it's really not going to be gone or gone.
Unbelievable drama in the Lithuanian and Polish Boxing Chamber
It took more than a week to wait for the final verdict of the judges who became the winners of the cross-border meeting between Lithuanian and Polish boxing voters.
Nine Polish and Lithuanian twins were organized in Poland.
Four eyeballs were won by both Lithuanian and Polish.
Finally, the final decision of the panel of judges and the competition secretariat was taken at the end of the two-year term.
The event started with the Lithuanian boxers' victory.
Lithuania’s repeated champion Marius Vyšniauskas (weight category up to 52 kg) certainly 3:0 won Jakub Surma, soon Edgar Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) won Radomira Obrušniak after fighting 2:1.
Two of the winners were: Damian Durkaças (up to 64 kg) 3:0 defeated Manta Dužina and Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) 2:1 Prophet Simon Banius.
Vytautas Volliss (up to 75 kg) returned to the Lithuanian elections.
Lithuanian 2:1 defeated Bartos Golebiewsky.
In another battle, Piotr Szczukowkis (up to 81 kg) in the third round was clearly overpowered by Eigrida Casmos, and the result again became equal to 3:3.
He followed the brothers differently.
Robert Jokulis (up to 91 kg) 3:0 defeated Andrzej Kolton, and Arvyd Jokulis (up to 91 kg) had to recognize the advantage of Adam Kuliki in the first round.
Most of the discussions were held by Tado Tamasausko (up to 91 kg) and Mikhalo Soczynski's fight.
The publication of the final outcome of its cross-border meeting took more than a week.
One judge won the race, two judges - Lithuania, but because of the technical error, the point for one judge to Lithuania was read out to Mr. Soczynski.
After the long-standing disputes, the victory was left to the Polish boxing officer - 2:1.
The Lithuanian and Polish elections were won by the owners of the 10/8 (two points are awarded for the victory).
They managed to cause the Lithuanians for the sudden loss of their previous mother.
In 2015 at a meeting held in Marijampolje, Lithuanian boxers won even five fights out of six and sought victory at 10:2.
The meeting of Lithuanian election leaders in Poland was a general repetition before November 14-17.
Following the country's priorities, a new Lithuanian box will be formed, which will protect the country's respect in the next year's world and European championships.
How does the dog determine the direction in which the man went?
You already know that the dog is very sensitive.
They may employ hidden explosives, drugs, blood, other animals, some even recognize diseases by their breath.
It is well known that the dog’s trails are heard in movies, but their work is much more difficult than you thought.
How do they determine in which direction the owner of the trail went?
In fact, this issue is far more difficult than you think.
The follow-up consists of three steps - the discovery, the direction and the follow-up.
The second stage is far more difficult than the other two, since it is difficult to decide which direction a person took.
Well, there's not a second between the different steps, so their smell doesn't really differ, is it?
Not exactly.
In 1990, a study by the University of Oslo described experiments that led the dog to a 90-degree angle in the trajectory that man passed.
Tests carried out on grass and on asphalt.
And in many cases the dogs easily set the direction of human walking, even when he tried to mislead them by past relapses.
Can you imagine the challenge this is?
The difference between the nearby scent of the trails is very low and in time it is even more decreasing.
However, scientists say that this is not so strange - dogs can say and which part of the ground is covered first.
This is because their port is an incredible tool.
Dogs dominate the areas responsible for the disease in the brain (as our brain dominates the regions responsible for the disease).
Dog nose has 125-300 million smell receptors.
In general, dogs are at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but their ability to interpret different smells plays an even greater role.
Scientists then carried out analogous experiments and with bicycles left behind, but their path was much more difficult for dogs to follow.
This is because bicycle cancer is not segmented as a current human footprint, so it's harder to isolate different places for comparison - it's not natural for dogs, so it takes more time.
True, dogs are not the strongest owners of the bear.
This title is likely to correspond to the arcs.
The white beaks follow hundreds of miles of ready - to - marry chicks, and the red beaks catch up to 30 miles [30 km].
Private Forests Promises to Regulate Crossword Puzzles
Minister of the Environment Kęstutis Navickas will explain on Tuesday in Seim on the crossing of forests.
At the end of August there was a public dissatisfaction with the forests in the Labanor regional park.
For the month, the crossing of these forests was stopped.
The Minister has acknowledged that the trials of the attacks in Labanore have shown that there have been no serious violations.
However, the Ministry of the Environment has already introduced a number of restrictions, taking into account the proposal by the Working Group to strengthen forest management in forests belonging to the State.
The Minister promises that other legislation adjusting forest crossings will be drawn up by the end of the year.
The same restrictions are intended to apply to public forest crossings and to private forest management.
Agnie Jagelavičiūtė revealed the strategy of 170 thousand followers
We need to give people what they want, and at the same time put on what they want, LRT TV shows "Cultural with Nomad" says Agnie Jagelavičiūtė.
According to the stylists, it gradually formed a huge minority of fans.
"At first, I am pleased with the pleasure of the man, the tempo to himself, and in the course of time that taste is better," - believes A. Jagelavičiūtė.
A. Jagelavičiūtė has more than 170 thousand followers in her Facebook account - she has reached this number using a certain strategy: "At first, I am pleased with the pleasure of the man, the pace towards himself, in time for a little better taste".
Stylist A. Jagelavičiūtė says it is harmless to be suspicious, so he shows his face as he is - authenticity and ability to find the best way of presenting are the most important criteria in social networks.
It notes that there is no human culture left on social networks, because many Internet users are going to go back to them to make someone angry or read comments from other people who are in the process of being around: "For example, there was a time when I wanted to hang out with everyone and shit - now I don't want it anymore."
"False life is the most terrible thing.
And in social networks, that's a lot.
Faisbuke is a little less than an Instagram," she says.
A. Jagelavičiūtė is speaking about women's emancipation by sending a specific message on social networks.
It also promotes the production of journals and also looks at creation in its work.
"I can't say that fashion magazine is a pure art expression, but I know there's a lot of it there.
I believe that there are many creations in my work, as well as emptyness.
I'm balancing -- that's my key to those huge numbers.
I don't want to create a real life.
Where it's better to give people what they want, and quietly insert what they want," - believes A. Jagelavičiūtė.
One of the most difficult events for young people is classical music concerts.
Their popularity is a well-known offer in the history of life: to talk about backwardness, failures, and life events, thus remaining authentic.
That is exactly what A. Jagelevičiūtė proposes to apply to the whole culture.
It is said that without applying to anyone, without doing any entertainment and showing true values, culture has no opportunity.
"How is a boring teacher against students - are there any chances?
If we don't find a way to present this art, advertise without advertising, it doesn't matter.
When we're real and get the reader, maybe someone's gonna change.
Once again, the second, the third, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, and the second, the second, and the second,
Three people went down the cliff in Lithuania to the north of June
On Saturday after the helicopter crash to the north of June, a search started for three people in Alaska.
One man was saved after the disaster on Friday, and the other three failed to find him.
The helicopter crashed near the Lithuanian Gulf to the north west of June.
It was found that it was "Airbus H125" on a long journey to Grand Preria Texas.
On Friday, the aircraft crashed 100 feet from the coast.
According to the Associated Press, one person saved was 14 years old.
She was reported to have mild hypothermia, but there were no other problems.
Two adults and two teenagers fly in the falling wing.
According to KTVA, David King (53), Josh Pepper (42) and Andrew Pepper (11).
It was found that Senior Pepperd was the director of Davis Constructors & Engineers of the Alias Construction Company.
I don't know why the accident happened.
The National Transport Safety Council has declared that the investigation has been initiated.
"I have killed a helicopter, which was completely new – just received from the factory – two adults and two teenagers fly," says the report of the Coast Guard Officers on the basis of the KVA.
It was found that the pilot had 40 years of experience in flying fixed-wing aircraft and aircraft, including flights in Alaska.
According to Anchorage Daily News, a family friend Jeff Brodsky said that his neighbors "did not lose hope that a miracle would happen".
With the help of the coast guard helicopter, the rescuers updated on 17 February 2016 the search for alpiners who have experienced in Scotland on Nevis Mount Fort william.
On Saturday, in Alaska, three people were searched for after a helicopter crash.
"I've experienced sexual violence"
The president's counsellor Kellyanne'a Conway revealed sexual violence on Sunday morning.
Conway commented on the heated disputes between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh and his accused Dr. Christine's Blasey Ford.
Conway was moved to discover that he had experienced sexual violence himself, and defended B. Kavanaugh against the leader Jake Tapper, claiming that the judge was accused of sexual violence by ignoring the negative facts of the charges.
“I am very touched by the victims of sexual abuse and violence.
I experienced sexual harassment myself," Conway said at the State of the Union on Sunday.
"I'm a victim of sexual violence and I don't think Judge Kavanaugh, Take's Tapper, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible for this.
We ourselves must be responsible for our conduct."
Conway said the news network must be ashamed of Kavanaugh's comparison with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced last week to imprisonment in the state of Pennsylvania from three to ten years.
Conway also criticised the Senate Courts Committee because it was unable to remove former President Bill Clinton, who took up oral sex in his office and lied to the U.S. people.
The survey showed that Kavanaugh’s and Ford’s evidence divided the U.S. society
The Americans do not agree on the evidence of Bretto Kavanaugh and his accused Christine's Blasey Ford – the accused claims that the judge sexually attacked her when they were teenagers.
The figure of Ford or Kavanaugh’s lie almost matches: 38 per cent of respondents say that Kavanaugh’s probably or undoubtedly lied in giving evidence, and 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Courts Committee heard from both parties when Ford sent a letter to Senator Diane Feinstein with full charges against the judge.
After the letter was published, both Ford and Kavanaugh said that he was ready to speak before the committee.
In giving evidence, Ford claimed 100 percent is true that at the beginning of the 9th century, she tried to catch up with Kavanaugh, not another person.
In the emotional introductory language, 51 C.E., a woman said that she felt a civil duty and could not remain silent.
"I'm very scared," she said.
"I'm here because I think it's my civil duty to tell me what happened to me when Bretta Kavanaugh and I went to high school."
Ford and two other women’s allegations of sexual harassment by Kavanaugh stated that “there was never a sexual attack in high school, in college or at any time later”.
“All of us have tried to find something that would hinder the vote for my nomination, no matter how unrealistic it is or how clever it is,” he said.
"This is the simplest dirty last minute."
The results of the survey conducted by YouGov on 27-28 September, involving 2607 people, did not reflect the opinions of the different parties: Democrats were more likely to believe Ford (73%) and Kavanaugh (74%), although Ford was more likely to believe in evidence than Kavanaugh (14% compared to 11%).
The founder of the exhibition "Body Worlds" called "Daktaru Mirti", wants to be cut and demonstrated in his own exhibition
The German scientist who has invented plastinum wants to become an eternal part of his body worlds exhibition.
Guntheris von Hagens has devised an innovative method that enables the demonstration of the elephants, shells and organs around the world in a show, a show of surprise and surprise, and conflicting assessments.
A man who died from cancer at the age of 73 told his wife to plasticize him after his death to become a permanent exhibition at Body Worlds, which will be opened this week in London.
"It will certainly be the end of his life.
I now understand that I will have to do this because I will express my recognition and love" – Angelina Whaley told The Observer.
She said that the husband had given strict instructions about what to do with his laundry, and the whole process would take about a year.
Musculoskeletal, nervous and arterial disorders should be performed and silicone should be administered to the body and placed in the right position.
"He said to me, 'Angelina, you can freeze me up to 25 degrees a year, but then you'll have to add your hands, otherwise I'll lose my hands.'
So, I'll be able to fail for a year, then I'll have to take it."
Then, in the ideal case, he will join the exhibition in the pavilion of London next to other bodies that are hard in time with upright possums, such as riding horses or playing cards.
Von Hagens heard a broadcast in the United Kingdom during a direct broadcast of British television (this was the first public broadcast in 170 years).
Since 1995, more than 47 million people have visited Body Worlds worldwide.
The founder of Body Worlds London Peter Tabernalis told The Guardian that 100 percent of the exhibition, covering about 28,000 square feet, exposed by the donor people who "gived consent because they wanted to save the living, light them and help them see possible problems".
“We see and read so many terrible things that we are dying.
None of us will escape it, death is common to all of us, and I believe that Body Worlds shows that there is no need to be afraid," said Tabernalis.
Ronaldo's lawyers threaten the prosecution for the use of charges
The Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo's lawyers said on Friday that the German newspaper, published by the American "evidently illegal" statement that Ronaldo had been arrested in 2009, would be brought to court.
One of Ronald's lawyers, Christian Schertz, said that the article "Der Spiegel" was "an unacceptable statement of private charges" and he would seek legal redress for his client.
The application was sent to Reuters by Ronaldo, representative of Gestifute, in response to a request to comment on the article "Der Spiegel" published on Friday on the Internet.
Gestifute did not answer specific questions about the contents of the Der Spiegel statement, which Reuters could not self-test.
Der Spiegel first published the allegations in April 2017.
One of the most popular athletes in the world Ronaldo earned five times the title of the best player in the world.
This summer he moved to the Italian Youth from Real Madrid; the Italian club refused to comment on the Der Spiegel statement.
It is reported that the alleged abuse took place in the hotel room of Las Vegas in June 2009 – this was said by the lawyer of Kathryn Mayorga, Leslie's Mark Stovalls, who filed charges.
Stovall told the newspaper that Ronaldo and Mayorga did not agree with the court.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality contract for Ronaldo's $375 000 paid.
Stovall did not respond immediately to Reuters e-mails about comments, and Mayorga did not respond to calls on the home phone.
However, Stovalls told the journal Der Spiegel that he had filed a civil complaint in order to cancel the confidentiality contract.
Mayorga told the journal Der Spiegel that the contract did not exist because it still feels the consequences of the previous night nine years ago.
"I have experienced a serious crisis," she said, "Der Spiegel".
‘And yet, the charge of abuse.
I blame him and I blame myself for signing this."
A sustainable business that ensures the independence of the creators
Are you ready to try Self-Publishing 3.0?
The new White Paper, published today by the Association of Independent Creators on the "#selfpub3.0" website, explains for the first time in detail how to join other entrepreneurs, become independent and start a sustainable creation business.
The association of independent creators is founded by Orna Ross, not the first to be recognized by one of the 100 most influential people, will explain at the Digital Book World 2018 conference why developers should allow Self-Publishing 3.0 methods.
"The trends in handling, e.g. popularizing personal trademarks, responsible use and reading on mobile phones, together with digital publishing technologies create a very favourable environment for the business of creators," Ross says.
However, only independent and creative thinkers and their knowledgeable creators who understand the value of intellectual property can take advantage of these opportunities.
"#selfpub3.0" encourages developers to create several sources of employment through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and media.
It is possible to earn from direct sales, subscription models, concentrated aid, broadband models and other sources of income, such as online training and the activities of the relevant entity.
"#selfpub3.0" also encourages the distribution of books in various formats as widely as possible using retailers and other services.
The main objective of "#selfpub3.0" is to encourage change of mind and learn to manage your creative business so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative asset, would not be unintendedly transferred to another company, such as specialised publishers or an independent publishing service provider.
According to Ross, so the creators can increase their income, influence and impact, and these methods need to be interested not only in every digital age creator, but also in publishers; it also stressed that real independence of the creators (as well as other people) ensures commercial and creative freedom.
The future is here.
And its prospects for independent creators are now the best.
The book Self-Publishing 1.0 describes computer publishing and printing as required.
Self-Publicishing 2.0 theme is the sale of e-books for readers and telephones in online bookstores.
Now begins a new, Self-Publishing 3.0 era, where independent publishers will be able to start business with prospects and sustainable business.
The Union of Independent Creators is the only world non-profit organization that unites self-publishing writers.
The Union’s objective is to develop the skills of independent publishers, promote ethical activities, help start-ups sell books and encourage creators to carry out a sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
The presidents of the country and central bank warned the Italian government about the planned deficit
After hearing the plans of the populist government to raise the deficit expenditure a lot next year, the President of Italy and the head of the Central Bank warned on Saturday that the country's debt had to be managed.
On Thursday evening, the ruling party (opposing movement of the Five Stars and the Northern League of the Right) presented a proposal for a deficit of 2019 to achieve a deficit of 2.4 per cent of the total domestic product (GDP) and three times the previous administration's target.
This report affected the market on Friday and prompted the sale of bonds and hit the banks' shares.
Furthermore, such plans are incompatible with the European Union, applying EU fiscal rules and monitoring their compliance.
Speaking to the audience in the President's Chambers, which mentioned the 70th anniversary of the Constitution, President Sergio Mattarella said that, under the country's framework laws, "the budget must be balanced and the debt must be managed".
"This is how we protect our citizens' savings," he said.
At a conference in central Italy a little later, President of the Italian Bank Ignazio Visco said that the country's debt cannot be further increased, which is the largest of all the major European Union economies and is reaching 131 per cent of GDP.
"Italy must give priority to public and private investment and manage and reduce public debt," said Visco, based on the knowledge agency Ansa.
"School must be reduced consistently."
The North League leader and vice-president Matteo Salvinis replied in Matarella's words that the debt increased over the year under the strict requirements of Brussels.
"Don't worry, Mr. President," said Salvinis in a statement.
"The debt of the government has been depleted over the year by the budgets of Europe, and we finally change our plans and aim for a better future and growth."
Earlier, before speaking to Mattarella or Visco, the Five Star Movement Commander, Luigi Di Mayo, said that money would be stolen in advance" from the budget, but added that the government did not intend to oppose the EU or financial markets.
The ruling parties have been pressuring a non-commissioned minister of economy Giovanni Tria to support their planned deficit expenditure.
The Italian media said that Matarella supported Tria's failed attempt to maintain a budget deficit that would not reach 2% of GDP.
The presidents of the country and central bank do not have a direct impact on economic policy.
The President of the age of 77 may reject the law and return it to Parliament, but only once.
Parliament can then again adopt and legislate an unchanged law.
Official information: Large wave of Indonesian tsunami sensors passed
The Indonesian geophysics agency withdrew the warning about the tsunami 34 minutes after its release, and later a severe earthquake took place, sending a huge wave to the northeastern coast of the island of Sulawesi, where hundreds of people were killed and thousands were left homeless.
Car rentals after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, on 29 September 2018
At least 384 people died during the 7.5th earthquake and tsunami that struck about 1,500 km (940 miles) from Jakarta in the city of Palus.
Officials said on Sunday that the number of victims is likely to increase.
On Friday, a number of people gathered at the Palus beach festival, which hit a six-foot (18-foot) wave of the dead.
On Saturday, the geophysics agency BMKG called for criticism in the social media: a lot of people were wondering if the tsunami warning had been revoked too early.
The Agency claimed that it had carried out the standard procedure and decided to withdraw the warning according to the data of the nearest flood sensor about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
"We do not have observation data from Pal.
We therefore had to take a decision according to the data we had," said BMKG, Head of the Earthquakes and tsunami Center Rahmat Triyon.
The nearest flood meter measuring the changes in the sea level was only, he said, a six-inch wave (2.5 inch) of "unsignificant" and did not notice the huge waves near Paul.
"If we had had a floodbed near Paul or had received data from him, of course, the situation would be better.
We have to think about this in the future," Triyon said.
According to officials, the tsunamis hit Paul and the surrounding areas at a high speed — hundreds of miles per hour, but it is not clear whether it occurred before or after the notice was withdrawn.
The residents are checking the Lavonus in the street looking for their family members after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, on 29 September 2018.
"On the basis of video footage on the social media, we believe that the tsunamis occurred before the official withdrawal of the warning," Triyon said.
Most of the damage was caused by a 9.5-ball earthquake on the second day of Christmas 2004 and caused a massive tsunami, which killed about 226,000 people on the Indian coast, including 126,000 victims in Indonesia.
The picturesque city of Palu, where 380,000 people live, is near the narrow bay of Slaves Island in the north-east.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency (BNPB), the city was destroyed by tsunami in 1927 and 1968.
According to Oxford University Geophysics researcher Baptiste Gomberto, the earthquake was not expected to cause tsunami.
The earthquake on Friday took place due to a horizontal break – the nearby tectonic plates fell horizontally, not vertically, as usual for tsunamis.
"It is believed that there was a shipwreck in the sea, a flood of water and a tsunami," he said, adding that the force of waves moving along the coast could be concentrated in the narrow bay.
The representative of the disaster reduction agency Sotopo's Purwo's Nugroho told the correspondents that his team was "ready to send easy-to-understanding public warnings", when the tsunami warning was abruptly revoked.
According to the Ministry of Communications, there were repeated text messages sent to the residents with warnings, but Nugroho said that the electricity and communications lines had been cut off because of the earthquake area and there were no sirens on the side.
In the social media, the Indonesians doubted whether BMKG should have withdrawn the warning about tsunami and resented that the information had not been provided in time.
"I'm disappointed... the warning was revoked... and the tsunamis still happened..." -- Twitter user @zanogucci sent a direct message to BMKG.
Golf: Mollywood duet is about to crash ticket sales records
After winning the fourth match on Saturday, Francesco's Molinaris and Tommy's Fleetwood became the first two of Europe, which I won in all four pairs of matches, and is likely to be recorded in history, as Europe is already the first result of 10:6 before the Ryder Cup final.
After winning Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau at 5:4, they became the first European couple to win all four cats.
Only the Americans Larry's Nelson and Lanny's Wadkins were able to do this in 1979.
The alarming results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – show not everything.
Three times the couple won 14 important titles, Woods, and twice won over Patrick Reed.
They also sought victory against Jordan Speithe and Justin Thomas – this week's U.S. team, which won three more matches.
Molinaris and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans to win five points of the five possibilities.
Fleetwood has already earned most of the points in the Ryder Cup matches as a new European.
The couple, who will receive new sick people from the Mollywood industry, at first glance did not seem to be able to bring Europe's teams forward.
The Ryder Cup of News, such as Fleetwood, does not expect such an event, and Molinaris has not won any of the previous six matches and has been defeated by four competitors.
However, there was hope: Fleetwood was the first in Europe last year, known as Le Golf National Square as its five fingers and here in 2017 won the French Open tournament and demonstrated a strong temperament during this year's U.S. Open.
Molinaris is a new British Open champion and is considered by many to be the most consistent player in the European tournament – this is a useful feature on the top floor, where a high grass can lead to loss, as US failure has shown.
These players' features and harmonious game on the platform made them ineffective.
"Now I feel a little sensitive, but only on Saturday," said the cheering Fleetwood, who played the whole weekend with a broad smile in his face.
This afternoon we had a good show, a stable and good game.
If we get to know each other in history, it'll be a great achievement.
I'm just glad we tried for the team."
The moliners also enjoyed it.
"It was good to play with Tommy," he said.
"But we need to carry out our duty, not just to access the books of records, so tomorrow we will have to fight hard for the 4.5 point we need to win; it will not be easy."
Rhythm of the knights!
Irish village cooks mid-age fighting field
The Claregalway castle in western Ireland was once powerful, the main fortress of the 15-year-old family of the English Rite, and this Saturday was remembered for its origin.
Ritteri dvikova soldiers during the Middle Ages Fight Festival in Claregalway Castle in Golveju, Ireland, on 29 September 2018.
A completely restored Anglo-Norman house with a boxing castle has been converted into a medieval battlefield, where many enthusiasts from all corners of the world have restored contact fights and games that were popular many centuries ago.
On September 29th, 2018, Charles Dornán, who was armed with the Rite, and who was involved in the fight against Donna Dornan, was patrolling Claregalway in the major art of the city of Golvėja, Ireland.
"It's a great weekend and something unusual," said Denise Fitzgerald of Keri's graphics, who became the owner of the shackles at the end of the weekend.
"We have thus returned to the simplest things.
I'm trying to do everything the right way," said the theatre employee, who was the first to participate in the war festival.
In the field, the fightingmen were genuinely dyed, and although their swords were a bow, some of the colds were folded, and one injured his lips.
The riders demonstrated their skills by driving and cutting pillows and buffs across half.
The metal slabs put up weapons, and the tasters prepared drugs, and the artist’s rope and dyed wool.
Those who were seriously offended and deeply affected tried to get involved.
"I think anyone can wear a costume, but the feeling of being a role is art," said Helena Stackpoole, who played Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald and had a unique opportunity to use her fashion design knowledge.
“All costumes are handmade.
I've been wearing my belt for two years, and now I'm wearing my dress and I've only held 800 beads on her hands.
It matters to me," she said.
After earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of deaths increased to 832
According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency, the number of people killed by earthquake and tsunami in the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia increased by 832 on a Sunday and the affected area is higher than originally expected.
The agency's representative Sotopo's Purwo's Nugroho's said at the news conference that many people were hit by a 7.5-ball earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused a six-foot (20-foot) wave of high tsunami.
The FBI contacted the second woman who accused Kavanaugh
FTB agents investigating Bretto Kavanaugh’s case as a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court referred him to a second woman who was charged with sexual assault, the lawyer of this woman revealed on Sunday.
The report by Deborah Ramirez lawyer John Clune states that the FTB's investigation of the Kavanaugh's case will not only cover the separate charges that Dr. Christinea Blasey Ford presented to the Federal Court of Appeal judge at the dramatic Senate meeting this week.
Ramirez blames Kavanaugh for showing her her five at the party where she was drunk and who was at Jeil University when they both studied there.
U.S. President Donald Sumpas presented a press release to the independent Senate and instructed the FTB to conduct an investigation after a Thursday Senate meeting, where Professor Ford of California University made extensive accusations that Kavanaugh tried to seize her in the evening of 1982 when both of them attended school and were teenagers.
The NBC News reported on Saturday that the White House restricted the scope of the FTB investigation.
A short time ago, he denied it and published a message from Twitter: “I really want them to question all the people they need at their discretion.”
The representative of the White House, Rajas Shahas, said that the Senate had determined the extent and duration of the FTB study (the study should be completed within a week).
"The White House allows agents to do what they are taught," Shahs said.
United Kingdom does not comply with environmental or animal protection standards after Brexit
Minister of the Environment Michael Gove said on Sunday that the United Kingdom will not comply with environmental or animal protection standards so that after Brexit it can make trade transactions.
The Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of Britain, Michael Gove, arrives at the Downing Street in London on 24 September 2018.
Speaking at the annual Conservatory Party conference, Gove said that the United Kingdom would benefit from being aware of its quality food products and the government will publish a food strategy this year.
Europe returns the Ryder Cup in unit matches
Francesco's Molinaris won the prize on Sunday by returning the Ryder cup to Europe: italian won Phil Miquelon at 16 and earned a point that helped achieve the required 14.5 result.
Mikkelson went to the dome when he launched the first ball into the water, while Molinaris was able to remain in the driveway as the first European, winning all five cats a week, even though none of the previous six were successful.
The European victory has already been ensured that Italy launched a hit from the starting point and the ground victory was missing one point, while Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia were the first of the sword and was sure at least half of the point.
At the beginning of the day they were the first to score 10:6 and had to earn four and a half points from possible 12, so that they could return the Trophies and establish their stay at home, which has continued since 1993.
Prior to this, the team succeeded only twice in eliminating the difference between four points and winning the unit contests: this was done by the United States team in 1999 in Brooklyn and Europe in 2012 in the wooden miracle contests, but no one expected another amazing return.
Justin Thomas, Webbas Simpson and Tony Finau gave the Jim Fury team hope to win the first cats, but then scattered the European team points across the platform.
Thorbjorn Olesena upset Jordan Speithe, and his team friend John Rahm – Tiger Woods: 14 important titles were lost four times.
The best Ryder Cup player recognized by Ian Poulter was waiting for what was good, most of the ovation this week, when the world's best player Dustin Johnson released him at the 18th Riding Square and brought Europe to victory.
Then it had to wait, which mother would finish first, and it was Molinar's game that brought joy to the mini, which was the greatest event in history.
RT World News: German policemen protecting Erdogan used the name neo-Nazi as a code word
According to local media, secret officials in East Germany, who protected Turkish President Erdogan this week during his visit to Berlin, used the name of a pitiful neo-Nazi extremist.
The Ministry of the Interior of the region said that the Saxony Crime Police in East Germany is investigating two members of the elite anti-terrorist board.
Men were destined to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his long-awaited trip to Germany.
Officials had to work secretly, so the protocol required the use of a code name.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt, a pitiful neo-Nazi belonging to the extremist group of National Socialists (NSUs), who at the beginning of this century killed eight immigrants from Turkey, one Greek citizen and a German police officer.
The local media reported that a strange code name had been found when two police officers requested permission to obtain the internal documents needed to carry out the task.
The officers in charge immediately withdrew the officers.
The first police chief Petricas Kleine of the Saxon criminal police responded to the news.
He said that the decision to use the name Boehnhardt was "probably the stupidest" and thus "evidently ignored victims and their loved ones".
Mr Roland Waller, Minister for the Interior of Saxony, endorsed this statement and called the decision "silver, fearless and totally unacceptable".
Erdogan’s Friday visit to Berlin led to many contradictory assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticized for adopting the leader charged with growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said that this visit is very important, “if there is no disagreement, they need to be dealt with in private meetings”.
The public first heard about the NSU in 2011, when the bodies of Boehnhardt and his partner Uwe Mundlos were found in a trailer in East Germany.
One of them is thought to have killed the other and then killed the bank in Eisenach after a failed attempt to destroy it.
The third member of the neo-Nazi group, the last surviving Beate'a Zschaepe.
In July of this year, the German court sentenced her to death for 10 counts in murder.
She refused to contribute to the murder, but her lawyer claimed that the defendant felt morally guilty because he did not try to stop the murders.
After the NSU scandal, the German security agencies were in great criticism.
Lawmakers, activists and victims' relatives believe that the group had much more partners.
It also showed that the German internal intelligence agency BfV infiltrated many informants into the NSU and constantly interfered with the group-related murder, attempted murder and kidnapping.
Muska withdraws from the position of Head of Tesla and will have to pay $20 million a fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elonas Muskas agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which brought him before the court on the fraud of Twitter messages in which he said he would make Tesla a private company.
Musk will have to leave the leadership, but the Director-General will remain.
The documents of the Agreement indicate that Muskas must be removed from the office of President of the Council of Directors of Tesla within 45 days and shall be prohibited from returning to these duties for three years.
In addition, he'll have to pay $20 million.
It all started with a message from Twitter that was too careless or genuinely misread, so Muskas will have to receive prior approval before saying or announcing about Tesla "in any format, including but not limited to it, on social media (e.g. Twitter), on the company's website (e.g. the company's website), on press releases and on calls to investors".
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million because Musko's original Twitter messages have not been checked.
Muskas is accused of misleading investors in the twitter message of 7 August, in which he claimed to be able to make Tesla a private company, one of which would be worth $420 – therefore the company's securities cost more than 10 percent.
Muska soon withdrew his words by saying that Tesla would remain public and that investors were being misled.
The Securities and Exchange Commission decided that Musko’s initial statement “was incorrect and misleading because it did not consider the facts”.
Muskas himself explained on the website that this error could be justified: after meeting with the representative of the independent wealth fund in South Arabia, he seemed to have been able to agree on the funds.
It is reported that Musku and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been drawn closer to the lesser penalty – Musku should have refused the President's position for only two years and should not be admitted guilty, but Muskas refused this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday the price of Tesla's securities fell, and it is likely that this changed his opinion again and agreed with more stringent conditions.
However, under the new agreement, as under the old one, Musku does not need to be admitted guilty of the error of investors.
The Patriarch of Alexandria committed himself to supporting the canonical church of Ukraine and called for Orthodox unity
The Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria stated on the basis of a canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Patriarchate of Moscow.
He responded to the separation of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
On Thursday II, Teodor arrived in Odessa, South Ukraine, and met with the highest church representatives and the faithful Orthodox.
The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected Orthodox hierarchies, which only deplaces the ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.
"I have come to tell you: do not give up Orthodox faith and the canonical church," said Patriarch Theodore II.
Prior to his visit to Odessa, he met with the mayor of the Polish Orthodox Church, Savva, who also supports the canonical church of Ukraine.
They also called for the prevention of conflicts arising from attempts to justify the autonomy of the Ukrainian church.
"We will always support those who seek Orthodox unity," said Theodore II.
The Orthodox Church has recently experienced a major crisis following the decision by Constantinople to recognise the independence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.
The latter belongs to Russian Orthodox churches, also called the Moscow Patriarchate.
Constantinople decided to send exarches to Kiev, thus violating the rule prohibiting one Orthodox church from interfering with other matters.
Egzarchai are special patriarchal representatives formally occupying a higher position than the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which is currently head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Moscow Patriarchate took a bad view of Constantinople's actions and called off all the church's requests and members of the organizations which were managed or co-chaired by the representatives of Constantinople.
However, it is claimed that this decision has warned Constantinople not to take any other hostile action and that both churches have completely discontinued their ties.
Of the three churches in Ukraine, only one of the other churches is recognised as part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate.
Most Ukrainian clergy recognize its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the separate churches – the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Kyiv Patriarchate, which was established in the 10th decade.
This religious movement even has the Patriarch's published leader, Filaret, in order to recognize the official Orthodox Church, complete independence and equality with the Patriarchate of Moscow.
Damascus opened the main Syrian-Jordan trade transition for the first time in three years
According to the State News Agency SANA, the Syrian government has claimed that it is opening a crossing of the Nasiba border with Jordan, which has been closed for three years for military action in this territory.
This can be done because the fighters on the Syrian side left the land to the city of Dara.
Nasibas is the most important trade link not only between neighbouring countries, but also between the Gulf of Lebanon and Persia.
Main ideas from the UN Lavrov language
While visiting the UN Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergeius Lavrova attacked the West on the "political blackmail and brutal force" and said that diplomacy should not give rise to dictatorship and unilateral sanctions.
At the UN General Assembly on Friday, the minister said that some Western countries were trying to maintain "the positions of world leaders themselves" without conscience.
He did not mention specific countries, but said they use "political blackmail, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world must pay a high price for the selfish ambitions of a small group of countries.
Lavrova, representing Russia for ten years, said at the meeting that the culture of diplomacy and negotiations changes the dictatorship and unilateral sanctions applied without UN approval.
The Minister said that the sanctions applicable to many countries are "illegal or ineffective" and recalled the embargo imposed on Cuba for many years.
"But history has not taught us anything," Lavrov said, adding that "the Westerners are willing to blame only if it is "very likely".
We remember how often confusion and wars were justified by such unjustified accusations, such as the 1999 explosions in Yugoslavia, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 intervention in Libya."
Of course, Lavrov did not mention all Western invasions and mentioned the seven-year Syrian war as one of the most recent cases.
A failed attempt by extremists to overthrow the Damascus regime could have been lost all over the country and opened the way for the establishment of "terrorist caliphate".
Lavrov welcomed the Astana peace process launched jointly by Russia, Turkey and Iran and said that this process helped prevent the Islamic State (IS, previously referred to as ISIS) and other groups that wanted to capture all Syria.
Now it is most important to restore the country's lost places of war and to help refugees return safely.
Lavrova returned to the battle of the great forces and said that the UN was actually set up "to learn from the Second World War".
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia recalled that in 2018 the "disgusting" Munich Treaty, signed in 1938, which France and the United Kingdom agreed to allow the nations to join the German-occupied part of Czechoslovakia in order to instruct Hitler.
Although British Prime Minister Neville's Chamberlain at the time said the Munich Treaty "will bring peace to this time", the war began a year later.
"Munchen's betrayal" shows how far "the country's selfishness and violation of international law can go," Lavrov said.
"The dictatorship and oppression of the colonial era must help the history archive or trash."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the world's problems, Lavrov said.
"If you have any questions or objections, sit down and talk, reveal the facts, listen to your colleagues' arguments and try to reconcile interests."
Krislas, let's see?
RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are sinking into the fog, and Bibi's fingering into Iran
The President of Israel, in the speech of the UN General Assembly, claimed that Tehran has secret nuclear weapons.
It may be that the accuser of Israel is hiding something.
The favorite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released the news on Thursday, showing highly photographed photos of places where Iran is likely to hold nuclear material.
Tehran replied without delay that Tel Aviva would rather take care of his "undeclared nuclear weapons program".
Although Israel never recognized (but did not deny) the possession of nuclear weapons, RT journalist Muradas Gazdjevs tried to find out if Tel Aviva really should look for the poison in his eyes.
The Scottish Government: no complaints concerning Alexo Salmondo were made before January
The Scottish Government stated that no complaints concerning Alexo Salmondo were recorded before January of this year.
In January, the former Prime Minister was charged with two counts of sexual harassment, although he strongly denied them.
In March, he was informed of the investigation.
Salmon, after resigning from the Scottish National Party, will deal with the Scottish Government on the grounds of the complaint against him.
In reply to the claim that one complaint was first examined in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaints were recorded before January.
A representative of the Scottish government said: “In January the Scottish government received two complaints about Alex Salmon.
We could ignore them or hide them.
Previously, the Deputy Prime Minister did not hear any complaints about Alexo Salmondo and, as we have already said, the Prime Minister heard for the first time about the study from Alexo Salmondo in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legitimacy of our processes and will firmly defend our position.
The Scottish Government will try to obtain as much information as possible over the time available.
However, as we have already mentioned, we cannot now comment on Mr. Salmon's case for legal reasons."
Alexo Salmondo said: “We will not hesitate because our petition against the Permanent Secretary is now being considered at a court hearing and we hope that a decision will be taken soon.
We'll talk in court.
Our aim is to prove that the complaint procedure against Alex by the Scottish Government is illegal."
Glazgas disturbed by the result of the Dragons 29:13: "Warriers" played Lee Jones Smurf
Glazgas returned the winner title of Guinness Pro14 by winning additional points and winning the Dragons Scottstone Stadium, and Coach Dave Rennie is not blind to satisfaction, but he believes that the game could have been more precise.
After the unexpected loss of the Southern Kings team in Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie's highly changed teams asked her to try and although she was able to collect the necessary points so that she could remain at the top of the A conference, the wind and the rainy air played was certainly not brilliant.
"I think we've defended well tonight, played on the right side of the field, and our strategy was good," Rennie said.
"We had to play more precisely and we could take advantage of more opportunities.
The conditions were unfavourable.
We have created many opportunities, and we are happy.
It should be played more precisely, but 40 or 50 profit points today would not have been a good result.
We should have tried.
We won additional points, but we have to make more effort next week to play home with Zebra and next week with Saracens in Europe.
Although the air was windy, the Glazgo team started to win points early, but TMO received all the lost balls of Huwo Jones, including the internal transfer of Niko Matawalu to the left corner.
Disillusionment did not last long: the left column of Olis Kebble passed through the middle of the fourth minute, and Adam Hastings easily received the casting.
The Dragons reduced the difference when Arwel Robson received the penalty, and the security converted the other player immediately after 20 minutes of marking and the whales won the point.
The match after a rather peaceful first took place after almost half an hour's notice: the Glazgo attackers consistently attacked the Dragons line, then the judge from South Africa Stuart Berry punished the bikers for 22 minutes on the side of Hastings.
Warriers went into the caves but lost the ball after a smooth transfer, because after a few hits the left side of Matawalu could not control the ball and it was transferred to the left.
The second test was carried out two minutes after the interval: Hastings launched the Dragons line and wisely transferred the ball to Lee Jones.
The ball was returned to Hastings in his position and the result of the matches became 12:6.
The first minute of the second half of Glazgui was very successful: Alex Dunbar was hit by Lee Jones and helped by Hastings.
However, the Warriors failed – just four minutes ago they took over the ball in the middle of the square and the Dragons Center Adam Warren pushed him through the door, thus winning points, and then took over Josh Lewis after the open game with Robinson.
Warriers quickly returned to the leading position and the 54th minute after the fourth test won additional points when Huwas Jones fled to the right and Hastings failed to pass the ball (this was the third failure of four tests).
The Glazgas maintained a comfortable higher position and did the fifth test several minutes later – Dunbarus passed the ball after a thunderstorm with George Horne, and Hastings won points.
Kebble's published by the best match player, but Rennie's been chasing Hastings.
"They obviously prevented us from playing, but we broke up in the middle," the coach said.
"He missed a few meters, but he was skimmed and still managed to get away.
He is good in form and trusts himself."
"Ayr United" won by Morton 1:5: the five stars "Ayr" shook the host team
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore won two rounds, and Declan McDaidas added one more and thus helped "Ayr" to stay on top of the championship table.
"Ayr" flew forward after Shankland's invasion of six yards after Michael Rose's vantage point to McDaid.
Morton compared the first 35 minutes of the first test with Charlie's Telferas taking the ball from Robbie's Crawford in his own field and sending it down by Air to Ross Doohan.
The players of the Grinoko's fourth-second shoot had a chance to push forward when Doohan smashed Gary Oliver, but Michael Tiderser launched a weak sentence that the triggerer easily caught.
The 74th minute of "Air" was the second time the rivals crossed, when the transfer of Craig McGuffie's long distance was dropped in the air and dropped onto the ground was sent to the door of another replacement player, Craig Moore.
Moore transferred the ball to Shankland the same minute, which had invaded 17 this season.
To the fans, Moore returned to his side a quarter from the edge of the square, and McDaida sent a jumping ball to the door.
Alloa and Falkirk games ended with 0:2: first youth victory in league
"I'm glad, I feel relief, I'm happy," said Ray McKinnon after the very first Falkirk victory league and the winning season points.
“Rangers” borrowed by the attacker Zakas Rudden (18) earned after being put in both stands and pushed the owner team “Alloa Athletic” into the bottom of the championship and released the club from under pressure.
"It was an important game for us," said McKinnon.
“We probably earned more during the last three matches, so it was good to earn three points in a tense situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
It would not have been a result, but it was important for us to win."
Rudden sent a ball to Patrick Brough in the 26th minute and earned a consumption from the second line of the gate in the middle of the well, when Diamond Petravičius slowly blew the ball over the well of Neil Parry.
"We wanted to protect firmly, but failed," said Mr. Wasps's head Jim Goodwin.
Hearts patients' request for half-finals received more than 11,000 signatures
Hearts' patient petition for the Betfred round half-final schedule was signed by more than 11,000 people.
The surgeons are upset about the decision to organize both semi-finals on the same day and at the same stage.
As advised by the Scottish police, the SPFL decided last week to hold the "Aberdeen" – "Rangers" at 12:00 and "Hearts – "Celtic" at 19:45, thus provoking the "Jambos" and "Dons" of the sick.
"The Evening News" together with "Aberdeen Evening Express" called for a fair solution to the situation on Saturday.
The so-called "Super Saturday" decision was condemned by Aberdeen and Hearts: both clubs issued statements criticising the schedule.
On Thursday, a request was published on the change.org website requiring one of the games to be moved to another place or date.
A man indicted by two women in the village of Kent
Two women, who were about the sixth and the eighth, died in a place of crime.
According to police representatives, another man, also within the age of 70, has been hospitalized and is stable.
The 28-year-old who lives on the same street is arrested and will be sentenced on Monday for two murders and one incarceration to kill Medveja judges at a court meeting in which he will participate in a videotape.
The police haven't named the victims yet, but they think they knew the suspect.
The neighbors said they were shocked by such an event in a village that they say is “silly and friendly”.
In 31st century, Sophie Moorey-Brown, Press Association, said: “We have lived here for five years and have never heard of any bad events – always very quiet and happy to live here.”
The royal archives and the musical "Hamilton" create a world of light about the King's Jury III
After the Queen presented the project, which opened a large archive of documents compiled in the year of the reign of George III, it was hoped that letters, journals and languages would help society to get to know the kings of thought.
Now these documents will reach a different audience – the Royal Archives decided to cooperate with the Westendo music in an unexpected way.
The academics who wanted to reveal the true face of the king invited the musician "Hamilton" Jury III to review the most important documents from the time of the reign's propproproval.
Researchers are trying to make old manuscripts available to a wider audience, so they will be able to obtain digital documents from the audience.
The members of the royal family have already publicly supported the creation of music, and the Hercogay and Hercogay show will be seen twice, although Prince Harry’s father is constantly shown on stage.
In Westen, Michael Jibson, who was the king of the West, said that the documents made him think and helped him to get to know the king, whose image was made by the audience by the musician Hamilton, the film "Keralian Jurgis's Ignorance" and the series "Honey History".
"We fell in love with beautiful letters"
U.S. President Donald Sumpas did not maintain enthusiasm after trying to reduce tension with North Korea's leader Kim Yong Unu and said on Saturday at his sponsors' meeting that after writing letters they "loved me".
Mr brief and Mr Kimas said that they would pursue nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula, as they discussed at the unprecedented meeting that took place in Singapore this year.
Before moving to a new phase of history after many years of public disagreements, the leaders of the countries changed threats and abuses because North Korea wanted to create a nuclear missile that could reach the United States.
“I was as strict as he was.
We have always spoken," said Dr. Druppas at a meeting in West Virginia.
"And then we fell in love, you know?
In fact, he wrote me beautiful, beautiful letters."
Lekavičius and Panathinaikos entered the Greek cup half-final
In the fourth final match of the Athens "Panathinaikos" of the Greek Cup, the victory was celebrated without any greater effort by Lukas Lekaviči.
The Athens team escaped with 76:68 (29:24, 17:15, 15:11, 15:18) defeated the Patru 'Prometheus' team.
Lithuania spent 14 minutes in the square, earned 4 routes (2/2 dvit.), recovered one ball and performed one transfer of results and went twice.
The result was that Nick Calathes, who won 15 points in the Panathinaikos.
Squirrel cross for Shimonyte: everything decided by the party's "roof"
Prime Minister Saulius Squarenelis said that there was a lack of democracy in the internal elections of the Conservatives, and the party's leadership actually appointed Ingrid Shimonyta as a candidate for presidents.
The feast of "democracy" itself was still strange, gently saying when the party's grill, the top decided and actively supported one candidate.
Perhaps the second candidate had no chance of winning even theoretically," said S. Skvernelis to journalists in the government.
"The Conservatives appointed their candidate, with this and we welcome them," the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister of the Greens of the States said that I. Shimonyt should appreciate the voter by recalling her work in the Andria Kubili government.
Mr Quavernelli has not yet commented on whether he will participate in the President's election.
The Union of Lithuanian States and Greens intends to approve its candidate next year.
The leader of the ruling "states" Ramūnas Karbausskis called the conservative elections "the unsuccessful experiment" because of the activity of the few parties.
"First of all, we need to congratulate the experiment, which has absolutely failed.
Only 55% of the party's members, totaling only about 20,000 voters.
Knowing what money was needed to be spent to organise those elections, it is clearly one that did not justify it," - the news portal delfi.lt said to R. Karbauskis.
"I don't think the cost will be worth the result, because the result is nothing, the party has decided that their candidate is doing so - it's all right, but for whom to spend as much money," he added.
During the weekend of the internal elections, 79% of Conservatives and their supporters voted in favour of Šimonyte's candidacy.
Lithuanian wages joke Estu: one area can change everything
According to the Baltic Salary Survey conducted this year's Baltic State survey, the wage has grown mainly in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia have little left behind from their neighbours, which is written in the company's press release.
"After surveying 850 companies and examining changes in remuneration in the Baltic countries, we see that monthly wages before taxes this year in Lithuania grew 81.8% and on average increased 7.7% and annual wages with additions - 10.5%.
Latvia has given us little attention - a little bit more annual pay, but as in Estonia, a smaller number of employees compared to our state," says the representative of the company organizing the pay survey, Povilas Blusius, and adds that with such wage growth trends, the overall economic indicators of the country that dictated them should also be taken into account.
In Estonia, wages are increasing as fast as possible
Although wages in Latvia and Estonia were lower than in Lithuania, the increase was higher.
In Latvia, the annual wage rose by 71% of the company's employees surveyed and reached a little more than 11% in our country.
In Estonia, the remuneration this year rose by 73% and an average increase of 13%.
Remuneration trends also have a significant impact on workers' change, as changing jobs can be much more rewarding than in the previous workplace.
For those who did not change their jobs in Lithuania in recent years, the annual salary increased by 8.8% - more often than in other Baltic countries.
In neighbouring Latvia, the annual wage growth for such workers was 3,6 per cent, respectively.
Estonia remains the leader in the Baltic countries, not only as the average wage for new and long-term workers.
In the absence of changes in jobs or jobs, the reward was the fastest: monthly - 6%, annual - even 9%.
According to the R & D expert, such trends often depend on, or go along with, the overall economic indicators of the country: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, state monetary policy, prevailing market trends.
For example, forecasts of the coming economic crisis encourage business to behave more cautiously, less investment.
The dominant and fastest growing sectors of the country, such as information technology, construction, pharmacies, can also generate common statistics and absorb smaller changes.
The largest tax burden for Latvians
In comparison to wage growth, it is important to take into account the different tax systems in these countries.
In Latvia, employees pay most of the taxes, depending on the remuneration, even 31 or 34%, which may increase to 42.4 per cent.
There is a constant 24% rate in Lithuania, so with higher wage growth in Latvia, workers can expect a similar or even less sensitive increase than in Lithuania.
Estonia is subject to a similar tax rate as in Lithuania - 23.6 per cent, so in this country we find the most favourable labour tax in the Baltic countries.
In the field of IT - the most competitive remuneration
According to the study, in all Baltic countries, almost independent of the level of duty, the position of IT specialists remains among the best paid.
The opposite is the situation in retail trade - the market indices in this area are one of the smallest and therefore employees earn less than the average market income.
Compared with the previous year, the rate of pay grew rapidly for engineering specialists in higher positions as well as for risk management professionals.
This increase in remuneration did not cover some IT positions this year - a large part of the monthly remuneration for information security specialists increased to up to 14 per cent.
In the meantime, the wage in retail trade remained almost unchanged.
However, some companies have successfully implemented remuneration systems and have raised the annual salary due to premiums by about 2 per cent.
According to the remuneration experts, the trend is that wage growth dictates the need for the most demanding specialists - the demand for system analysts continues to grow in the Baltic States.
Ariana Grande suffers again: the former promises don't lie
After separation with Ariana Grande killed Pete Davidson, he poured out his pain by creating rumors about their two relationships.
By participating in Saturday Night Live, he chose to laugh about how fast he attacks serious relationships.
The honourable Members say that the truth is that just three weeks ago Ariana and Pete withdrew their pledges, which took place just after a few months of knowledge.
Pete's tried to create scenarios that mention his relationships that didn't work out, but it will happen on screen a little later.
The humorous humour of his former relationship exacerbates Ariana himself.
She's not in her heart. She's in pain.
At least that's how TMZ told the foreign news portal.
White or red: the dietologist recommends the choice of sugar
Baltasis on the object?
Which sugar?
During the polling centres, it became clear that although Lithuanians still traditionally collect white sugar, the fact that many nations completely renounce this white-dead ingredient is surprising.
The fact that black sugar sales are growing does not blind the representatives of trading networks.
According to the representative of Maximus, red sugar is becoming more popular and the nations are buying it more and more, although the usual white sugar - according to choice is still the first.
Also growing and organic sugar sales are growing and specialised in organic products shops.
One of the most popular products there is coconut sugar.
According to Dietologist Dalia Waitkevičiūtės, the main difference is the price and the adverse health effects may have on both.
"The raw raw sugar is three times more expensive, but from a health point of view these sugars have increased, and their use is harmful to the body," said Mr. Vaitkevičiūtė.
In the case of non-sugar-free living, the dietologist advises that his daily intake is reduced gradually.
This means that the benefits are all-round - falling down and unwanted kilograms, better and better health.
A month of consistent use of less sugar will make it easier to give up altogether.
"Every habit we develop is about a month from time to time, so after doing such an experiment, let's say, a month from time to time when we drink a product without sugar - coffee or tea, we'll see how positively this will work and I think that we can all give up a little bit of effort," - advice on how to refuse sugar was given by an ideologist.
Doctors claim that white blood sugar is not necessarily used - abuse of sweeteners can become causes of obesity, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases.
Therefore, it would be worth trying to use it as little as possible, so that this product is added to many foods, even to food.
Another "Lietkabel" step: Lipkevich lends other LKL teams
The Lietkabeli team of the Panevežios said goodbye to Vyteni Lipkevičii - the attacker is loaned by the Prienų' Skycop teams.
In this "Betsafe-LKL" season V.Lipkevičius established 6.4 points in 22 minutes, recovered 2.8 balls, performed 2 successful transfers and selected 8.5 points of utility.
FIBA Champion League 29 years 198 cm high athletic statistics scored 3,8 points, 2,5 points recovered, 1,5 results transfer and 4,8 points in 21 minutes.
In the near future, Lietkabelis will publish a new purchase that will strengthen the composition.
S. Buškevics joined the training staff
The Senior Coach of the Lietkabeli team, Nenado Chanak, became an assistant to Lithuanian Sandis Bushevics.
In the 2005-2006 season, 41 Latvians played Vilnius "Lithuania in the morning", and in 2014-2017 worked in this club's system as a male coach.
Last season, S. Buškevics trained Jäkabpil's Jekabpils team.
The sports director, Jonas Vainauskas, invited Stephana Babraska to the headquarters, but he is still planning to continue his career as a basketball player.
Vytenis Jasikevičius was also invited, but he was unable to agree on both sides.
Buskevicas will work with Robert Kuncaiči and Algimanta Bružu at the Lietkabeli training staff.
On Tuesday, Latvia will join Lietkabel and will be on the Cido Arena during the FIBA Champions League match with Dijon U.S.A., but we will not develop it on the ground yet, as registration ended 24 hours before the start of the match.
Biofuel prices reduction will not be acceptable for all
In order to reduce biofuel prices, more leafy trees will be passed in Lithuania in 2019, says the Minister of the Environment.
According to Kęstusti Navicko, this is how you want to "affected" biofuel prices.
"We have a large collection of certain species.
The balance should be taken (...).
The concentration on soft leaves is because we can do a little bit of impact on biofuel prices," said Mr. Navickas on Tuesday when presenting the situation of forest crossings.
According to Navicko, this year the price of wood in Lithuania increased by around 20%.
According to the Minister, in the next year, the spear will be lifted as much as this year and the eagle will be about 80 hectares less.
According to him, more wood is harvested in Lithuania due to favourable natural conditions.
"It shouldn't be next year," said Mr. Navickas.
Now 10.2 million ha of forests are state-owned and 800 thousand ha are private.
Fighting food prices - doubtful obligation: will encourage you to buy only in your area
The proposed obligation for public bodies and organisations to buy 50% of food from local producers among the measures submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture is announced by the news portal 15min.lt.
"The law would apply not only to small traders operating in the regions but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or office goods could also be supplied to the buyer in municipalities by local companies that won the competitions," said Mr. Virginius Sinkevičius.
The president of the association of meat processors, Egidijus Mockevicius, does not doubt that this provision would discriminate against part of the businessmen, and would be difficult to control whether the law is not used by the sellers.
The measure of inconsistency is also criticised by the Head of the Business Confederation of the Sotkus.
Macrono calls on Europe to defend Russia and the US
French President Emmanuel Macronos called on Tuesday to create a "real European army" with the possibility of protecting against Russia and even the United States.
Mr Macron, calling on the European Union to build a common force from its accession to power, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on the US military.
Recently, he gained a weight argument after US President Donald Trump announced that Washington would withdraw from the important Cold War Treaty on Nuclear Forces.
"We need to protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States," - E. Macron said to the radio "Europe 1.
This is the first interview for his radio since the position of the President of the Labour Force began in May 2017.
"What do I see as President Short says that he withdraws from an important disarmament treaty created after the 9th decade of Europe's missile crisis, which will be the main victim? - Europe and its security," said the French leader.
The above-mentioned missile crisis has led to the development of non-strategic nuclear weapons, through which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
This crisis was a major factor in the United States and the Soviet Union's 1987 nuclear power contract (INF).
"We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army," said Mr. Macron in an interview that took place on Monday evening in Verden, northeastern France, to the President this week visiting World War I battle sites before the 100th anniversary of the end of this conflict.
According to Mr Macron, in this situation, 'as Russia, which is near our borders, has demonstrated the potential threat... we need a Europe that is better protected by itself, rather than simply dependent on the United States.'
The French leader became the main initiator, pushing the project into the establishment of forces from nine European countries capable of rapid joint military operation, evacuation from the war zone or assistance in the event of a natural disaster.
The Defence Ministers of these nine states will meet on Wednesday for the first time in Paris to discuss details of how this force will act.
The European Union has also been committed to significantly increasing its defence budget since 2021 and for research and development of new technology over the last seven years to around EUR 13 billion.
The current EU defence budget does not reach EUR 600 million.
However, Professor Bruno Alomaras of the French Military School of High-ranking Officers said that the vision of E. Macrono about the closely united European defence is difficult to implement.
"The idea of creating a common strategy culture is not bad, - he said to the news agency AFP.
- There is, however, a huge gap between the European defence that Emmanuel Macron has dreamed of and the facts are very big disagreements between the European partners."
Lukashenko threatened NATO with rockets: we are not idiots
Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said on Tuesday that his country will need new weapons if NATO continues to force forces to the Western border of Belarus.
"If NATO continues to be afraid of deploying the bases in Poland or elsewhere, Belarus will need more effective weapons, in particular missiles," the State News Agency BelTA quoted Mr Lukashenko as saying to the group of American analysts in Minsk.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already has its missile industry.
"In recent years - you have noticed and we are not blind - we have created our rocket industry and produced our very precise (applicable) missile weapons," said the President.
Last week, Mr Lukaschenka said that Minsk and Moscow were looking for an adequate and inexpensive response to the plans to build a base in Poland and to name it for the honor of President Donald Trump (Donaldo Trampo) of the United States "Trumpo Fortu" (Fort Trump).
"Of course, this is causing us concern.
If, let's say, in Poland they're going to say that they're willing to spend millions of dollars in order to dislodgment (...) some kind of Short Gate, of course, we're not idiots and of course we're responding to it," said Mr. Lukashenko, during the discussions of the Munich Security Conference.
"Of course, we are discussing with our main union (Russia) how to answer all of this and how to find an appropriate answer at minimum costs," he added.
Western relations with Moscow were marked by Russia's 2014 Crimean Annexes.
Their communication also covers Moscow's role in the Syrian conflict and this year's fight in Great Britain, as it is believed that the Russian special services have attempted to deplete a former double agent of the Sergei script as a paralysing substance.
The tension between Moscow and Washington further exacerbated October after D. Trump announced that he was planning to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on the regulation of nuclear weapons.
Russia warned that this step could undermine the global security system.
The man who executed the strike revealed how his wife was killed by a footballer
Brazil was ravaged by a crime in which the national footballer, Daniel Correa Freitas, was severely executed.
The athlete killed an 18-year-old girl at the birthday party.
A 24-year-old footballer was found dead in Paranas, southeast Brazil.
It is announced that he has been executed: severe neck injuries are reported, severe genital mutilations are reported.
After killing a footballer for 38 years, Edison Brittes Junior admitted his guilt and claimed that he did so because D.C.Freitas had abused his wife Christian Brittes.
Later, when the crime was committed, a Brazilian man on television told the details of what had happened on the final night.
"The dinner had already gained speed when I realized that for a long time I had not seen my wife Christian anywhere.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
After nothing was done, I broke down the door, and I saw Daniella lying down in bed with my wife, who asked for help.
I've been killed.
Together with my former friends at dinner, we pushed him into the field and drove him into the car.
Here I had a bullet with which I had fatally subjugated my wife.
I was very angry, I couldn't do anything at the time," the killer said.
Along with his friends, he threw a dead footballer's body next to the river, where police officers are looking for a major crime weapon.
The Brazilian civilian police arrested E.B.Junior, as well as his wife and his daughter, who were celebrating Christmas.
It is said that police officers investigating the incident are still finding evidence that the woman was abused during the evening.
True, the latest news and photos of the football player recently distributed on the WahtsApp can help you run the study.
The footballer sent two pictures to one of his friends through "WhatsApp" in which he stuck himself in a bed next to a sleeping woman who, as revealed later, was a murderer's wife Christiana.
"I can sleep here.
There are many women sleeping in different rooms.
I'm going to eat the mother of the cheerleader, although her father is somewhere nearby," the footballer wrote to his boyfriend.
Daniel Correa Freitas, a member of the São Paulo Club, was seconded to the São Bento league in Brazil.
The tragic death of Paul Walker’s daughter celebrating the 20th year: she did not go around without tears
The tragic death of Corporal Paul Walker's daughter, Meadow, will celebrate a special occasion - it takes her 20 years.
Meadow Walker, working as a model, lost one of the most loved ones in the world five years ago and is still a wall of silence.
In social networks, the girl very rarely left her teenage year with tears as she celebrated her birthday.
She mentioned him after she had met a little penguin, on whom was a beautiful pink number "20".
On the Internet, the frames where a girl calls on her birthday were spread, but they were quickly removed from social networks.

He was very proud of her.
"Ostino Powerso" fans left their heads: another part of the film is waiting
The cult comedy "Ostin Powers" has fascinated millions of people around the world.
Futuristic, funny frames and costumes are still becoming an inspiration for many fans.
The filmmaker and star star Mike Myers announced that the fourth movie "Ostino Powers" is also waiting.

He was a great cascade, a great dancer and a great man," said Mike Myers.
Juliette Lewis will join the Konersa series, created by Rosana

It's good that we're all headed by the wonderful Clairea McCarthy, and I don't want to see how this great team will destroy this story."
Thanks to Hurts, it is no longer possible to take advantage of the suspension
After this Saturday, Jalen Hurts will no longer be suspended for this season.
Hurts is included in the highest ranking "Crimson Tide" Saturday match against the weaker Louisian team and this is the fifth player's match this season.
The NCAA applied a new rule this year – it is possible to suspend the player who participated in the four matches.
This month, Athletic reported that Hurts was planning to do this because of the rivals' evaluations and team coaches' response to them.
At the beginning of the season, Tua's Tagovailoa changed Hurts, but Coach Crimson Tide said Nick Sabana was still planning to use Hurts' skills.
Last season Hurts helped Alabama to get to the matches for the title of the national championship against the Georgian team, but on the other hand Tagovailoa changed it, contributing to the victory of Crimson Tide 26:23.
The former South East Conference year attacker Hurts started the last 28 Blessed Cats and entered the season with a record result – 26:2.
During Saturday’s competitions, Hurts finished 22 of the 31 broadcasts during the first four Crimson Tide episodes, ran 276 yards, earned four points and took over the ball once.
He also ran with a ball 15 times and ran 54 yards.
Owens: Dezas must immediately sign the contract
The former attacker of Dallas 'Cowboys' Dezas Bryantas said shortly after returning to NFL.
A member of the famous museum, Terrell Owens, said that Bryant was better off without delay.
In response to a question posed by Twitter, when planning to sign a contract with a team, Bryanta announced on Friday a message from a single word on Twitter: "Soon."
Three times selected at Pro Bowl matches Bryantas does not belong to any team since, in mid-April, Dallas 'Cowboys' refused him in the face of a reparation dispute.
Bryanta, who may have refused the contract with Baltimore Ravens and is constantly linked to Kliveland Browns, said before the season that he wanted to improve before signing the contract with the team.
In August, when Owens, still talking about returning to NFL, came to a professional American football museum, told the TMZ site that Bryanta should try to get back to sports as soon as possible.
"He must join the team and prove to everyone what he can," said Owens to the website.
“All the investigators believe that he is no longer sitting and that he is no longer as good as he thinks he is.
He must now enter the team for any remuneration, accept a one- or two-year contract – this is completely irrelevant – and show everyone what he can do."
In 2017, Bryanta caught 69 times the ball, ran 838 yards and earned six times the points.
The 29-year-old player in his career – 23 matches – did not run 100 yards.
After signing a $70 million value contract for five years in 2015, Bryantas did not escape 1000 yards in one season and did not hold more than eight points of winning balls.
"If the Director-General or the owner knows that your skills are failing, you will not be able to secure or collect the required amounts," Owens advised.
He also warned that Bryanta had to get to the team as soon as possible, because later it could not be done at all and said that it would be possible to get back to the Cowboys who lived in difficult times.
“Of course, I don’t know if their relationships are bad enough,” said Owens, who won the points 38 times for playing three seasons in the Dallas team.
"I think that in the case of Dezo, if cowboys take him back and he gets the chance, it will be useful for Dezu and Frenchie."
The CERN Business Development Centre is being set up in Lithuania
In Kaunas last week, representatives of the European Nuclear Research Organisation (CERN) assessed the possibilities for setting up a CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten business incubators in Europe in which companies receive assistance in commercialising CERN technologies, developing innovative products and adapting them to the needs of the public.
Although Lithuania became a member of CERN only last year, the establishment of this organization's business incubator in the country was already mentioned.
CERN representatives visited the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) and the University of Kaunas Technology (KTU) Material Science and Biomedical Engineering Institutes in the valley of Santaca.
At the National Centre for Innovation and Business (NIVC) in conjunction with KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Grand University, Lithuanian Institute of Energy, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Agriculture and Business, guests discussed the Kaunas Innovation Ecosystem and opportunities for young, innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important because if the CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a major impact on the region's science and business innovators.
"This incubator would encourage the application of CERN's knowledge and technology to key issues such as new technology and artificial intelligence would be used for diagnosis and treatment, for the processing of large data," says Dr. Leon Balasevicius, Director of Science and Innovation.
CERN incubators, as well as other young business development centres, provide business development assistance - provide information and expert advice on product development technologies and assist in finding funding sources.
The difference is that the CERN incubator is more scientific.
This centre includes experts from various fields in Lithuania: information technology, materials engineering and medical specialists.
The CERN is best known for the largest Hadron anti-flux accelerator in Switzerland (LHC, The Large Hadron Collider), the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world.
However, studies are carried out not only in quantum mechanics but also in other areas, ranging from cryogenic (very cold temperature effects) to particulate monitoring and radiation studies.
The work carried out by these technologies and scientists has an impact on many areas of public importance: medicine, security and industrial development.
"Vilnia burner" has a new guide
The drink manufacturer AB "Vilniaus burnernė" appointed Roka Mituza as the new director-general, who will replace Raymond Pilka in these functions.
Since last summer, the company has been headed by Mr. Pilke to continue his duties as financial director of Vilnius Fuels, as stated in the report published by the Vilnius Stock Exchange.
Mr. Mituz is the co-founder of the manufacturing company Buga LT, listed in his LinkedIn account.
In 2012-2017, Mituz was the director of the region in the group "SPI Group", previously worked in the groups "Reckitt Benckiser" and "Unilever".
The "Vilniaus fire" ended in the first quarter of this year with a loss of 315,500 euros.
Last year, during the relevant period, the company made a profit of 392,300 Euro.
The company's sales revenues without excise amounted to EUR 4,956 million and decreased 13.16% compared to the first quarter of last year.
More than 100 people are working in the Vilnius Firehouse.
STT detained R. Ača - Business knowledge
The former parliamentary and former director of the administration of the municipality of the Rasei district of Remigius is suspected of embroiling.
He's in custody.
The Special Investigation Service (STT) shall report that the officials of the Šiauliai Board are carrying out a pre-trial investigation into possible corruption in the municipality of the Razeni district.
"The former director of the district administration of the district of Raseių municipality, R. A. (Remigius Akaz - ret.) is suspected of embalming.
The circumstances of an inadvertent public procurement, R. A. in the run-up to the municipal director's office, are examined: the possibility of an exclusive advantage for a private company to conclude a public procurement contract with a company managed by the municipality of the district of Rasenia.
It is suspected that R. A. has adopted a high-value basket (more than 250 MGL) for this," says the STT press release.
BNS adds that the company is "Rasian Bus Park".
On Monday, officials also detained the alleged head of the company "Raseių bus park" Vladislov Šimaits, a suspected corruption.
This was confirmed by BNS by the STT representative for the press Renata Enskorytė.
The STT report also states that the suspicions are also expressed to two representatives of companies who directly papered Mr. Ač or participated in the masking of a variety of financial transactions.
All suspects are detained, their workplaces and their home-scrats.
LSDD was suspended
After Remigius was a director of the district administration of the district of Rasenia for a while, but he lost these duties in April, without the Council's approval of his report.
He was also the mayor of this region in 2011-2012. Mr. Acz - a long-term member of the Seimas, he has been elected to parliament since 2004 as a candidate for the party "Tvarka and Justice".
However, in 2013 he and these parties split up and failed to deliver his own mandate in the Seimas elections in 2016.
Now P. Ajam is dependent on the separate Social Democrats and the newly created Lithuanian Social Democrats' Labour Party (LSDD) led by Gedimino Kirkil.
Shortly after this announcement, LSDD President Kirkyl informed the press that Mr. Time temporarily suspended membership in the party until the investigation was carried out.
"The actions of the Special Investigation Service and the suspicions expressed to Remigius Thank us are an unpleasant surprise, but in all cases it is necessary for law enforcement to take all the necessary steps to clarify the truth.
R. At the time, membership was temporarily suspended in the party until the pre-trial investigation took place," says LSDD leader Kirkyl.
In 2003, he was the head of a group of former President Roland Paxus, who was later removed from office by the prosecution, the National Security Advisor.
Maras A. Gricius: I did not directly control R. Ačo’s work
Neither the mayor of the Raseių district Algirdas Gricius nor the current head of the municipal administration Liudas Kavalaiskas BNS said on Monday that they did not have any information concerning the specific purchases of the law enforcement investigation.
Ms. Gracius said that he had heard about Mr. Acha's arrest from the media.
"I can't really say that we've been very influenced by the functions, I worked as a mayor, he (R. Achaz - BNS) - the work of the administration, and I couldn't tell you either for any reason or for what reasons this case was made of public procurement," - BNS said the mayor on Monday.
He also claimed that for the same reasons he did not wish to assess Mr Ach’s former municipal administration.
I was afraid to say something that I could evaluate his activities, because I did not directly control the work of his administration, as I was presented to me about public procurement, about the tenders, said that such and such public procurements, such tenders, after what was seen in the public space, were concluded contracts, which I already saw as mayor.
I cannot therefore state how he led the administration at that time as its director," said Mr Gracius.
He himself said that he did not interfere with public procurement and that he did not influence them.
Minister of Culture team - new advisor
The team of advisers from the Minister of Culture, Liana Ruokytes-Jonsson, was complemented by Dr. Jozapas Blažiūnas.
He advises on the management of archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage.
The Ministry of Culture reports that P. Blažūnas, a professor of literature and art at the Vilnius Academy of Art, was the director of Lithuanian literature and art archives from 2016 until now, the Professor of the Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University of Museums.
In addition, in 2017 VU students from the Faculty of Communication elected Mr Blažūna as the best faculty teacher.
The new adviser to the Minister is the author of many scientific articles on cultural heritage and value conservation.
Other not containing added sugar
VZ recalls that in May this year, Dr. Viktor Bachmetjev, who advised the Minister on public information policy, left the team of the Minister of Culture Ruokytes-Jonsson, was also responsible for media literacy and strategic communication.
On 2 October, Renaldas Augustinavičius announced his resignation from the post of Deputy Minister of Culture.
He was responsible for cultural heritage, archives, museums and libraries.
At that time, Mr Ruokytė-Jonsson said that the new Deputy Minister she has chosen will burn the same area as Mr Augustinavičius.
Currently, in addition to the area being cultivated by Mr Blažiūnas in Augustinavičius, the Council of Ministers is composed of Rita Grumadaitė, Evaldas Stankevičius, Egidijus Gailiūnas, Rusnė Rinkevičienė and Senior Counsellor Eglė Sadargaitė.
S. Gentvilas: A fine of EUR 90 million is being imposed on GPAIS's non-functioning business
The Vice-President of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, Simon Gentvilas, said that the poorly functioning product, packaging and waste accounting system (GPAIS) for Lithuanian producers and importers may have to pay nearly EUR 90 million at the end of the year.
"As the end of the year draws to a close and the GPAIS system fails to function normally, the systemic crisis in the packaging sector is becoming more and more real.
Unofficially, it is said that only 1% of the planned processing tasks have been issued of certificates approving the treatment of packaging waste", says Mr Gentvilas in the press.
On 7 November, the Seimun shall launch an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on the Environment, which will discuss the situation, to find out why the functions of this programme are not affected, why the programme module is not actually implemented, and how the Ministry of the Environment intends to address the problem.
"Without taking the necessary legislative or legislative initiatives, producers and importers are at risk and are getting huge environmental pollution taxes again at the end of this year," says Mr Gentvilas.
In his opinion, the shortcomings and inaction of the GPAIS accounting system signal a serious crisis in the packaging waste sector, which can be compared to the Metroil crisis.
Concern about tasks
Some of the companies may fail to carry out the tasks of processing the packaging wastes identified by the State in 2018, and some experts also warn.
In the light of the results of the first half of the year, experts confirm the underlying concern that some organisations may fail to manage the necessary packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, some companies might no longer be able to benefit from the tax exemption and would receive a pollution tax for the quantities of packages they have placed on the market per year.
The GOC noted that two out of three producer organisations currently active have rejected such concerns and that one does not comment.
Kęstutis Pocius, CEO of all Green Point organisations, said that at least formally it would be possible to overcome the tasks, depending on whether the problems of the information system for products, packaging and waste (GPAIS) will be solved.
The Green Point plans that this year will succeed in overcoming all types of package management tasks, except for glass.
Although the Green Point task of the glass will not be able to overcome this year, the organisation promises to compensate members for the resulting losses.
Experts doubt the benefit of food coupons
Experts doubt the benefits of this innovation when planning to share coupons for food products to the government and thus promote trade in family or farmers.
They agree that the new system would create an additional bureaucratic burden.
The head of the Lithuanian Confederation of Business Tax Commission Marius Dubnikovas says that the coupons have survived and the problem is not solved, and the Government should focus on increasing human income.
"The system seems rather strange and as if taken from older leaders.
If we want to help society buy something or have more purchasing power, we have to focus all our capacities on how to increase people's income, and people have to decide whether to buy in one or another shop," said Mr. Dubnikov.
In his view, the government, offering food coupons, would make it easier for people who receive less income.
"Of course, it applies to those who receive less income, as if by using a vacuum cleaner on the counter on which it would be written, we, this Government, gave you a vacuum cleaner, and be kind to us.
This sounds like certain anti-election promises where they want to write their signature very clearly," said the analyst.
It states that the food coupon system will require additional investment, and will also increase administrative burden, as it will need to monitor who and how they are protected from processing.
The bank's chief economist, Nerius Mačiulis, says that with one instrument to achieve both objectives - to support low-income people and small businessmen - would not succeed.
"If this is aid for small businessmen, the difference in prices and the population can buy more expensive goods in smaller shops, the difference in prices is compensated by the State from the budget.
Then it is support for business, but not support for the people,"- BNS said Mr. Mačiulis.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macroeconomic impact and would not substantially alter the competitive position of small shops and would, on the contrary, create an additional bureaucratic burden and could make the arrival of new market participants more difficult.
"It seems that this would be a fairly bureaucratic instrument with high administrative costs and would also be quite uncomfortable for the people, they should buy not in any larger shop with a larger assortment closer to home, but looking for several specialised stores with a smaller assortment," said the economist.
According to him, coupons are used in other countries where the volume of goods or services is limited and should be granted to all equally, or to some social group.
The people then receive coupons free of charge and can be released for food.
According to Mr Mačiuli, they are also used in the labour market by providing temporary tax benefits to businesses, by hiring long-term unemployed or, for example, former prisoners.
This practice, in the words of Mr Mačiuli, has also been successfully applied in Lithuania.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said on Monday that the government is considering a new system of food coupons would help the poorest people to increase competition and promote small traders or farmers' business.
The Prime Minister's adviser, Skirmantas Malinauskas BNS, said on Monday that the idea was mostly directed towards farmers and family businesses, and buyers with coupons could get a 20%-30% discount.
According to him, the amount of coupons would be limited so that farmers could not abuse.
According to him, 3-5 coupons would allow a person to benefit 10-15 euros a month.
Although the State budget does not yet provide for funds for the programme, it could be financed from this source, perhaps even from the European Union funds.
"Not everything currently provided for in the budget will be final, it will change in Seimas, so it happens, there may be funds being transferred from one line to another, and from ministries, to exchange possible financing matters.
It is always a matter of priority to decide whether or not to find another additional source of income and similar," said Mr Malinauskas on Tuesday.
To date, the scope and time of innovation has been determined.
