The members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they “seem to be like leaves ”
Some Members of the Assembly abstained from the proposal to change their name to MWP (see MEPs).
This relates to the intention to replace the Assembly's name with the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly were concerned that this could cause ridicule at political level.
One member of the Labour Assembly said that his group was concerned about "that this is bothering the Twp and Pwp.
Not for Welsh readers: The word "twp" means "devil", and the word "pwp" means "cuckoo".
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the whole group was "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
The Conservative of Wales claimed that his group was "open" because of the change of name, but noted that it was a reduction in the word from MWP to "claw".
On the other hand, the word w is thought to be similar to the word u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislation to replace the title, said: "The final decision on all the names of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be the issue of the members themselves."
In 2017, the Law of the Welsh Government granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals which were expected to give strong support to the Assembly to be called the Wales Parliament.
With regard to the appointment of members of the Assembly, the Commission has given priority to members of the Wales Parliament or WMP, but during public consultations, MWP has become the largest supporter.
Members of the Assembly clearly offer alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement may become the head of the President of the European Parliament, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislative amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on the scope of reforms and other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules on the plan for the disqualification of a member of the Assembly and the Committee's system.
During the debate on legislation, Members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on what they should be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A general vote was taken to resolve a dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, called Macedonia, for decades.
Athens has long claimed that its name as a northern neighbour represents claims to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's efforts to join the EU and NATO.
Contrary to the Plebiscito for the change of name, Macedonian President George Ivanova said that the vote would not go away.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is simply a price that needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s and other churches have been defeated in Harlem’s difficulties
“The old people I spoke to said that historically on each corner there was a bar and a church,” Adams said.
- Today you can't find either."
He said he knew why the bars disappeared.
“In these times people interact differently,” he said.
– Only there are no neighborhood sites where people gather all the time."
Speaking of the churches, he is concerned that the money that he receives after he sells the property will not be long enough, as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will come back to where he started.”
He added that the churches can be replaced by multi-bedrooms with cooperative apartments where people who will not help the remaining saints will live.
"Most people who buy cooperative apartments in these multirooms will be white," he said, "and will therefore hasten to the moment when the church will completely close, because it is unlikely that most of these people who have moved to these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built in 1870 in white congregations, before Harlem became the black metropolis, a metropolis community, and St. Martin’s church was built decades later.
The primary white Methodist congregation was deposed in the 20th century.
The black congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses, who had prepared the nearby prayer, took the name of the building.
St. Martin's church was taken over by a black congregation with the priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycotting boycott on 125th Street, at Harlem's main shop, which refused to hire or assign to higher positions blacks.
In 1939 the building was destroyed by fire, but since the parapets of the spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered the charilion.
John the Baptist, the son of a spiritual father, and the successor to St. Martin’s church, proud of the charilion, called the poor.
The experts who played the baton called it the "cultural lobby" and the "unchangeable historical instrument".
The University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also mentioned that it was the first charilion in the world to be played by the black musician Dionysius A. Lindas. 18 years ago he started playing a larger charilion in the church of Riversaida.
Merriweather said the church of St. Martin did not change it into another musician.
What happened in the last few months in St. Martin's church was a complex history of architects and contractors, some of whom were invited to the worlds of the church, and others by the Bishop of the Episcopal Church.
Zakristija – a parapia management body made up of world leaders, in July, expressed concern at the bishop that the bishop "will try to transfer expenses" to Zakristija, although she did not hire the architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained that the bishop lacked transparency.
In California, he injured a recipient of a 13-year-old lobster
Officials reported that on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy when he was in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
He was attacked 7 hours ago in Ensinitas near the Swiss beach.
Chad Hamelis San Diego's KSWB-TV show said that on Saturday morning he snored with his friends about half an hour when he heard the boy cry for help, and then he went back with the group to help him get out of the water.
Hamle told me at first that the boy was nervous about getting the lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: “I’m begging!
I'm impressed!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his whole key had been broken.
"I began to cry out to them all, that they might run from the water: 'There is a shark swimming in the water!' said Hamelis.
The boy was shot down by a plane to the San Diego Children's Hospital, where he was admitted to be critical.
It is not known what kind of boy has been attacked by a shark.
The rescue captain, Larry Giless, told the media that a shark had been observed in that area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Giless added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Officers closed the beach from Casablanca Ponto to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours for investigation and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
"Sainsbury's" plans to enter the UK's beauty market
"Sainsbury's" takes over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with the beauty of the universal shop-style sections where specialists will work.
Actively brewing into the UK’s 2.8 billion-weight sterling beauty market, which continues to grow and the sales performance of fashion and household goods is declining, larger beauty items will be tested by 11 shops across the country and, if they are successful, more shops will be installed next year.
Investments in beauty are growing, and shopping centers are looking for ways to use a chair, sometimes for televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's reported that it would double its beauty range up to 3,000 product names, including signs such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and for the first time Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will also receive more local brands in areas similar to those in shops such as Boots.
The Shopping Centre also re-issues its Boutique makeup range, most of which are vegan products – this is increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will test discounts in two Sansbury's shops, the first of which was opened last week in Kroid, South London, and the second will be opened later this year in Seli Ouke, Birmingham.
Due to the purchase of the internet and the desire to buy small quantities daily from local supermarkets, there is a need to make more efforts to attract people to visit there.
Sainsbury’s Director General Mike’s Coupe’s said that corporate stores are increasingly like universal stores, because the trading centres’ networks are trying to fight the selling goods at a cheaper price than Aldi and Lidl shops offering more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's included Argo's shops in hundreds of shops and also installed several Habitat stores, because two years ago they bought both networks, which are said to have strengthened the sale of food and their purchase was more profitable.
The previous attempt to update its beauty and medicine department was unsuccessful.
At the beginning of the first century of this century, Sansbury's tested a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended up arguing how to distribute revenues from pharmaceutical shops located in malls.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold a company to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network of the company Celesio for 125 million pounds in its 281 pharmaceutical stores three years ago.
It was claimed that Lloyds contributed to this plan by adding an extended range of brands of luxury leather care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
“We have changed the exterior and atmosphere of the beautiful rooms to improve the environment for our customers,” said Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be prepared to give advice.
The range of our brands is designed to meet every need, and because of the attractive environment and comfortable places, we are now a beautiful place that creates a challenge for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "incarcerated" because Holly Willoughby stopped his 11 million-weight sterling transaction with him
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones "ingested" after the TV show led by Holly Willoughby ended the 11 million-weight sterling transaction with his life-style brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
H. Willoughby no longer has time for their housekeeping and accessories brand "Truly".
The couple's business was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" series was announced in Instagram.
The last moment Holly Willoughby left a profitable mark of lifestyle to focus on his new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, the Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
According to sources, Jones was "insane" when the gold television girl at her busy meeting on Tuesday at the Marlou (Bakingamshire) capital of his business empire admitted that she would no longer be timed for her to use her household goods and accessories for the brand "Truly" due to new transactions of up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop, and was expected to double H. Willoughby's 11 million weight sterling assets.
As 37 years of H. Willoughby Instagram reported leaving "Truly", Jones left Britain for one of his summers.
The source said: "Truly" has so far been one of Holly's most important priorities.
This should have been her long-term future, lasting over the next few decades.
Its decision to leave was unusually surprising.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
There is a full stock of ready to sell the goods in Marlou's living room."
Experts believe that the launch of the The Morning pipeline, which is one of the most financially successful stars in the United Kingdom, can cost millions for large investments in products, starting with carpets and candles and finishing with clothes and household items, as well as delaying the start of everything.
And that could be the long end of friendship.
The mother of three children, H. Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been in close contact with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for decades.
In 2016, H. Willoughby and T. Cappu established Truly, and for 52 years Mr. Jones joined the fight as president.
The couple are on vacation together, and Mr. Jones has 40% of Baldwin's production company's shares.
H. Willoughby will become M&S’s trade mark ambassador and replace ITV with I’m A Celebrity’s leader Anta McPartlin.
The close source of Jones said yesterday: "We will not discuss his business."
We talked very hard and “then we fell in love ”
He laughed about the criticism received from the media about the comment submitted, which some might consider as "non-presidential", as well as the positive response of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trumpas give up so much?
A brief trusted "new leader" said:
"I didn't say anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was held a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, the nuclear disarmament negotiations are under way.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders on Saturday during the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not receive a "response" from the United States for the early disarmament of North Korea.
He noted that the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain pressure instead.
In his short speech, he expressed a much more optimistic view.
“We have a great deal to do with North Korea,” he said.
– We're going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We now support these excellent relations."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: it was after the rocket tests, the rescue aid and the return of American troops.
He defended his unusual attitude when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to get into this crowded arena, we'll have about 200 people standing here," said Trump, pointing to the mine standing right in front of him.
In Indonesia, tsunamis and earthquakes devastated the island by killing hundreds of people
In the wake of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organisations were notified that their aid was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the inhabitants of Lomboko were deployed, this was not announced in the national disaster – a necessary condition for providing international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been very clear that there is no need for international aid, so it is a little difficult," said Sumbun.
Although "Save Children" prepares a team that will travel to Pala, it is not clear whether foreign workers will be able to work on the spot.
The representative of the National Disaster Agency said that the Indonesian officials appreciated the situation in Palus in order to know whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has not yet developed a sad nature.
Although the specimens from the tsunami were built in Ačehe, they are not common on other shores.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palus, despite the announced warning, was likely to increase the loss of life.
Most of the time, it is difficult to travel between many Indonesian islands.
As a result of disasters, logistics becomes even more complex.
The Lomboki hospital ship, which treats victims of earthquakes, is on its way to Pala, but it will reach its new disaster site at least three days later.
President Joko Widodo chose the reconstruction of the broken Indonesian infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign, he generously issued money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not give peace to the administration of Joko, as he will again take part in the elections in the coming years.
No one is also under pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims are more conservative in form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes because of the use of cats, arrows, and other simple weapons by Christian and Muslim gangs.
See: Liverpool player Daniels Sturridge’s introduces a far-reaching consumption in games with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing Chelsea in the 89th minute of the Primer League in London on Saturday.
In keeping with the result 1:0, Xherdan Shaqiri transferred the ball about 30 meters from the Chelsea gate to the former Sturridge.
He hit the ball on the left leg and hit the far side.
High above the penalty court, the balls are flying to the right top of the network.
Finally, he crossed over the step-by-step of Kep’s Arrizabalaga and reached the network.
“I just tried to take a position so that I could get a ball, and players like Shaqas always play as much as possible ahead, so I just tried to stay as long as possible for the hit,” said Sturridge’s LiverpoolFC.com.
– I saw the coming in Kante, I fixed the ball one by one, and, too much thought, I just blew it."
After Belgium's star Eden Hazard's 25-minute intruder, Chelsea was first 1:0.
During that attack the "blue" attack in the middle of the field returned the ball to Mateo Kovaciciu and hurried towards Liverpool.
This area in the middle of the square quickly played the wall.
Then he quietly sent the ball between his opponents to the courtroom of the fallen Hazard.
Hazard lured the defenders and shot Alsson Becker through the Liverpool player with his left leg to the net.

The number of deaths from Indonesia’s tsunami has already reached 832
As reported earlier Sunday by the country's disaster agency, the number of deaths in Indonesia from earthquakes and tsunamis rose to 832.
The agency's press representative at the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho press conference reported that many people had been hit by buildings that broke down on Friday's account of the 7.5th earthquake of the ground, caused by a 6-metre wave, in ruins.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, was bombed by the ruins of fallen buildings.

The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was the resident of Berkenheda and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who knew my wife came to the event to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still ongoing because the police have reported that they are informing the victims of the nearest relatives.
Greison Mouse, a taxi driver who lives, has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have said that no one can enter the building and get out of it.

The Statute of the Parliament of the Cromwell shall be affected by the last blow of the "historic rewriting" dispute.
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the destruction of the cultural and religious heritage of England, which the fanatical followers of Cromwell Puritans are responsible for.
However, the Cromwell's friend, J. Cricko, described the proposal as "the stupidity" and "the attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the course of the current discussions on the statues transfer of Oliver Cromwell to the Westminster Chamber, the statue of Oliver Cromwell had to become an inevitable peace.
Cromwell didn't tell English civil war iconoclassm and failed.
Perhaps not that Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his father Tom in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's wonderful image of the Cromwell is a reflection of the 19th century's view and a part of histories, which many are still worthy of honor.
Goldsmith The Sunday Telegraph said: “Many people, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, were considered to be the defender of parliament from external pressure, and that was, of course, a monarchy.
Whether this is accurately illustrated, historians have argued so far.
Clearly, the mid - 17th century conflict formed a later development of our nation, and Cromvelis became an exceptional figure representing one of the parts of this magazine.
As the LORD hath preserved him, so are his accomplishments to be remembered and to be glorified.
The pig killed a Chinese farmer dead
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a South Western Chinese trade.
On Sunday, Morning Post reported that he had found a dead man named Yuan. Because of his damaged artery, he was bleeding and lying next to a pig at the shop in Liupansuja, Guiju province (South China).
On 30 May 2005, the pig breeder in Sining, the province of Shanghai, China, prepared to inject a vaccine for pigs in the pig population.
He reported that on Wednesday, he and his half brother from the neighboring province of Junan will travel to the shops to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the half brother found his family dead and found a door to the nearby pighouse.
He said that there was a great bull in the pig, whose mouth was covered with blood.
As stated in the report, the Court’s expert confirmed that the pig weighed 250 kilograms and weighed the farmer.
"Guyang Evening News" quotes: "My half brother's legs were bloody and injured," said the half brother, stating his name Wu, .
The material filmed by the security camera showed Yuan entering the shops to feed his pigs on Thursday at 4.40 p.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
When the man was found, the animal did not belong to Yuan or his half brother.
The manager told Evening News that the pigs had to be locked up so that other people could not be torn apart and kept up until the police picked up evidence on the spot.
It is reported that the Yuan family and trade authorities are responsible for compensation for death.
Although few, however, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016 the pig attacked a woman and her husband in a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly badly injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 295 pounds [295 kg] pressed a farmer named Wales to the tractor and pressed until the animal was raised by his wife.
After the pigs had eaten the Oregano farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but may promote the taste of blood.
"They're just playful.
They like butter, very delicate... who don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
Hurricane Roz's "remains" bring a lot of things to the U.S. South
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves through the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring a lot of things to the whole of North Mexico and the US.
On Sunday, from 5 o'clock in the morning, Rosa moved at a speed of 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane and was 620 km south of the Euchenian Gulf (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, on the Pacific side, it begins to form an extended area of low pressure and moves east, to the west coast of the United States. Since Rosa is approaching the California peninsula on Monday as an atrocious storm, it will start to carry a large atrocious humidity to the north, to the south of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico.
The humidity of the returnees, interacting with the approaching extended low pressure area, will then bring in in the coming days a wide-flowing rain to the south.
Instead of 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rain, it will cause a dangerous sudden flood, torrential current, and possible precipitation in the desert.
Because of the high humidity in some places, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, falls from 5 to 8 centimeters an hour.
The 5-8 centimeters of rain are expected in the south-west regions, especially in the major part of Arizona.
As a result of the rainy nature of the storms, there was a sudden flood and a rapidly deteriorating condition.
In the event of a storm of return, a particularly bad idea would be drawn into the wilderness by foot.
The heavy rain cannons can be transformed into riverbeds, and the perch can cause wind and dust.
The approaching extended low pressure area will bring some local heavy rains to the southern California coast.
It is expected that there will be more than one inch [1 cm] of rainfall that can cause a slight drop in flow and the roads can become slippery.
This would be the first drop in the wet season in the region.
Some of the rainstorms will begin to approach Arizona’s late Sunday and early Monday, and later the rain will spread late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains after Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and South America will rise on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In the spring, intense temperature fluctuations are possible in all the United States, because the Arctic is dense, but it will be quite warm in the rainy zone.
This is sometimes due to major changes in temperature in small distances.
On Sunday, there was a great example of major temperature differences in the Central US.
The temperature of Kanza Sičio (Misiūris) and Omaha (Nebraska) is almost 20 degrees different from the temperature of St. Louis and Di Moino (Ajova).
In the next few days, the heat from summer should again rise and cover more places.
It is expected that in the vast majority of the United States, from the Great South to the North-East, a warm October will rise with much above 27 degrees.
In New York, temperatures should rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, with about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the eastern US temperature will be higher in the first half of October than the average multiannual temperature.
More than 20 million people attended the Bretto Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people on the six television broadcasts were watching on Thursday the overwhelming attention of the statements made by the Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh and by the woman Christine Blasey Ford in the ninth decade of sexual violence.
However, the political unrest continued, after the broadcasters had interrupted regular programmes on Friday's last minute change: the senator of Arizona had an agreement to conduct a weekly investigation into city charges.
Ford Senate's court committee said it's absolutely true that when Kavanaugh heard it on high school dinner, she was arrested and tried to strip her of her clothes.
Kavanaugh was angry at testifying that he was absolutely sure it wasn't.
On Friday, Nielsen reported that it was possible that more than 20.4 million people were watching the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers watching the broadcast through CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has a certain difficulty with people watching television in offices.
In order to explain more clearly, it is an audience of the same size as it would be during the voluminous football matches or Oscar awards.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, led from all networks when the number of observers reached an average of 5.69 million throughout the day.
ABC, with 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS had reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, CNN 2.52 million.
A great deal of interest remained at the end of the trial.
The main figure of the Friday drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office announced a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was arrested on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameramen when the protesters called on him trying to lift him to the Court Committee meeting.
CNN directly filmed him with the eyes of the dead when he was drowned by people.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
– Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He was told, “You have power when so many women are helpless.”
Flake said that his office issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, added that he would have to say more at the sitting of the Court Committee.
The cable television and broadcasting networks were discussed directly when the Court Committee voted in favour of Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate.
However, Flake said that this would only be done by knowing that the FTB will investigate the allegations made to the candidate in the coming week, which the investigation called for to be carried out by a minority of Democrats.
Flake’s talk with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, was partly convinced.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake’s decision was taken.
Flake’s choice was valid because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve the Kavanaugh study.
President Trumpas launched an FTB investigation into suspicions against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister blames criticism of Brexit
President Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused her plans to leave the EU's critics "by playing politics" with Britain's future and to harm national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservatory Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published after her photo on the first page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called "Brexit" plan "Saxi" that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs, and said it was "total nonsense".
Shooting Wayde Sims Police arrested suspect Dytheon Simpson for LSU's death
The police arrested a person suspected of shooting 20-year-old LSU basketball player in Wayde’s Sims’ death.
Baton Ruže Police Department reported that 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for his second-degree murder.
Officials published a video of Simsa and Simpson’s capture, and the police mentioned that during the mustache, Simsa left her glasses.
The CBS branch of WAFB reports that the police took the glasses from the scene and found them on Simpson DNA.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had killed Wayde.
The lawyer informs that his release security is $350 000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rose Parapsy Expert Service issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet in the head, turning to the neck.
The section is awarded to the refugee police working group of the state of Louisia, the State Police Laboratory, the Southern University police and the local population who helped during the investigation after which the suspect was arrested.
The Director of LSU Sport Joe Alleva thanked the area for its right to "protection and enforcement of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
1.98 m high boy grew up in Baton Rose, where his father in Wayne also played basketball LSU.
Last season, the young man on average planted 5.6 points and captured 2,6 jumping balls during the game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "scattered" and "shocked".
"This is always thought of," Wade said.
Firefighting in Mexico City
From Popokatepetil’s volcano, ash has reached the southern Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans to keep away from the firehouse when the activation of the crater was recorded and the emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours 183 times.
The center has observed a number of threats and threats.
The pictures on the social media show a fine layer of ash covered with car front-glasses in the vicinity of Mexico, e.g. Chočimilke.
Geophysics noted that 72 km south-east of the capital’s volcanic activity increased when the 7.1-ball earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The fire department, called Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Prior to the vote on independence, the annual police met with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the independence protestors clashed with the rioja police and thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mention the first annual separation vote against Catalonia.
A group of boxed separatists who stopped the river police were covered in egg and powder paints. This caused dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
The police used the ladders to stop the later day’s mustaches.
In a few hours' time, an independent group singing "Imfortable, Unforgivable", met with Union protestors who called out: "Living Spain!"
The local press reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries suffered by protests.
The year after 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is ridiculed by Catalan separatists, remains a major tension in the region of independence.
The majority of voters decided to become independent, but because of a large majority of the votes cast, the number of voters who did not want to be separated was low.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year nearly 1,000 people were injured by police throughout the region in an attempt to stop the vote in the polls.
On Friday night, an independent group set up a camp to prevent demonstrations supported by the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to change the route.
At 68 years of age, electric Narcissus Termess, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer a true candidate for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we survived one of the best moments.
I watched my parents joyfully call for possible votes, but now we are in a hurry," he said.
Despite the vital and serious victory of the regional elections in December of the past year, it was difficult for the parties to the independence of Catalonia to maintain speed this year, when many of their most known leaders withdrew into voluntary detention or are detained and are awaiting a trial for the role of the referendum and later of independence.
According to a 42-year-old mechanic named Joan Puig, after filming a protest on his phone, the police said the conflict had enriched the politicians on both sides.
"Temperature is constantly growing," he said.
On Saturday, Orioli Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned in pre-trial prison since the end of the previous year, announced that he will be in the European Parliament elections next year.
"The candidacy in the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish government," he said.
Londoner. Keep in the house with the men who entered the car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after the car was reentered into London’s home.
The incident took place on Thursday about 7.30 p.m. (BVL) Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building were damaged.
At a certain point in time, the car could also have been fired with an arrow.
The Mengos hit secured Livingston's 1:0 victory against "Rangers"
"Livingston" player Dolly Menga's first takeover guaranteed victory
On top of the league, Livingston surprised Rangers, forcing Steven Gerrard to lose the second of the 18 matches, the leader of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengos hit was very important because the Gary Holto team compared it to "Hibernian" at the moment.
The Gerard team will meet with the Leaders of Hearts next Sunday during this season of the Premier league, from which they will be left at eight points.
Previously on Thursday, Rangers European league games at home with One Rapid.
At that time, Livingston extended his disproportionate series of unparalleled games in the division to six, while Senior Coach Holt has not yet felt the taste of losing, as Kenny Miller changed only last month.
Livingston's chances in games with static guests
Before the collapse of the Holto team due to its resilience to the various problems of the Rangers, it had to be before.
At first, Scott Robinson crossed and knocked across the gates, and then Alan Lithgow was unable to reach the head of Craig Halkett's transferred ball, and he pushed it next to the gates.
The owners, allowing the Rangers to play in front, were not upset because they knew that they could cause trouble to the guests by creating standard positions.
That's the way it was going to be.
The Rangers passed the free blow and Livingston took the lead; Declans Gallagher and Robinson transferred the ball to Menga, and after stopping it, he earned a profit from the center of the fine.
Since then, the ball has been controlled by Rangers for a longer time, but the protection of the owners has been ineffective and Liam Kelly's job has almost been lost.
Such a weight game continued in the second row, although Kelly had to work by pulling Alfredoed Morelos’s punch into the door.
Scott Pittman's gun was fired by Allan McGregor, and after another standard hit by Lithgow, the ball sent by the door.
When the ball was transferred, it was kept standing in the Livingston penalty court, but once in a while it was exhausted, and the two requirements for the penalty — one for meeting Halkett with Glenn Middleton after the change — and the other for the ball case — were not satisfied.
Analysis of the phenomenal appearance of Livingston
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni Arena
The Phenomenal Lifeston game and result.
For all up to one they were excellent and continued beyond expectations for the ever-increasing game.
The style of the game and the staff from the return to the highest league almost did not change, but the great merit should be given to Holt, because when he arrived he set the team on fire.
He's been treated by a lot of giants.
It was wonderfully played by Captain Halkett, focusing on a well-organized defense, and Menga was worth Connor Goldson and Joe Worall not to lose consciousness.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they play well under Gerard, this time they lacked much to reach their level.
They suffered a slight blow and only one time passed through the defense of the owners. Some worry calls were made in the middle of the table for the Rangers team.
Erdogan Kalne has been agreed variously
On Saturday (September 29th), there was a smile and blue sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's opposing visit to Germany, when he was aiming to restore relations between NATO allies.
The leaders argued about problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Calvary to open up a new giant.
The city has been established by the largest Turkish population community outside Turkey.
The police banned 25 000 people from fighting in front of a machete for security, but many supporters came to see their president.
These protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also tried to be heard by condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to accept it in their country.
Different protests show the breakdown of visitors: some German Turks consider him a hero, while others call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford. A bicycle driver died in a car accident
In London, a bicycle driver died in a car accident.
An accident took place near Beswood and Evelyn Street, on the road of the mobile Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10.15 a.m. BVL.
The driver stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
A few months after the accident occurred on Childers Street, another biker was killed, separated by a defendant who then fled, and this accident occurred about 1.6 km from the accident on Saturday.
The city police said that officials are trying to identify the person and inform his nearest relatives.
Roads are closed and bus routes are changed, drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartino Prison. Six officers injured during the crash
The Prison Service reported that six prison officials were injured during a major incident in the prison of special security men.
The incident occurred in the "HMP Long Lartin" prison in Vustershire on Sunday about 9.30 a.m. BVL, where it continues.
Special Tornado officials were called on to manage this riot involving eight prisoners and taking place in one prison.
Officials are treated for minor facial injury at the site.
The prison official said: “In order to manage the ongoing incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison, special trained prison workers were called.
Six staff were treated for injury.
We are intolerant of violence in our prisons and we are ensuring that responsible people will be handed over to the police and, possibly, will spend longer time than the players."
More than 500 prisoners are held in HMP Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison manager was being treated in the hospital after being attacked by the prison.
In October last year, officials were called to prison to deal with a serious riot, during which some workers were treated with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa with its sudden floods threatens Finiks, Las Vegas, Solt Leave Sichui (it can be useful for foreign territories)
It is not customary for the return depression to hit Arizona, but it is likely that it will happen next week when hurricane Rosa with her remaining energy will melt through the south of the desert and this will result in a sudden flood risk.
The National Meteorological Service has already announced that it will observe a sudden flood on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona, which is flowing south and east of Nevada, southern California and Jutos, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Solt Leave Site.
On Monday, it is expected that Rosa will be drawn directly to Phoenix as she approaches the rain.
In Finland, the National Meteorological Service noted that “only ten atolls have maintained the status of atoll or atoll depression no more than 322 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane not more than 64 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict that a drop of 5 to 10 centimeters will rise and the drop will reach 5 centimeters in some areas of Arizona Mogolon Rome.
Other areas of the desert southwestern, including central Walnut Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to range from 2.5 to 5 centimeters and can fall to up to 10 centimeters.
For people who are not hit by sudden floods, the rains of the Rose can be blessed because the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of them can be useful because they are now suffering from droughts in the south.
According to the US drought monitoring centre, a little more than 40% of Arizona suffers from very high drought, and this corresponds to the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa travels to the coast across the California peninsula, which belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still equivalent to the hurricane category of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of the Euchenian Gulf (Mexico) and moves to the north at an hour’s speed of 19 km.
The storm is facing colder waters in the Pacific region and is therefore severe.
So it is expected that it will reach the coast of Mexico with the storm force on Monday afternoon or evening.
Critics in certain parts of Mexico may be severe and pose a major risk to the flood.
"From the California peninsula to the North West Sonor is expected to wait between 8 and 15 centimeters, but a possible thing – and up to 25 centimeters of rainfall," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will pull north through Mexico as a storm of adventures, then Tuesday morning, reach the Arizona border as a result of the Return Depression, and Tuesday evening through Arizona will pull south Jutos.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is a huge amount of rain on the California coast, on the north-west Sonor and on the south-west of the US desert," the National Hurricane Centre reported.
These rains are thought to result in life - threatening sudden floods, torrential rains in the deserts and debris in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsamer Norton. Arrested four people suspected of attempted murder
Three adolescents and 20 years of age were detained by a suspected attempted murder after the founding of a 16-year-old boy by Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsamer Norton in the "Excelsior" terrace area, approximately 4 am according to the BVL on Saturday.
He's been taken to the hospital and now he's stable.
Eivono and Somerset police reported that at night a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in Radstock.
Officials have contacted all persons who may have any material filmed on the mobile phone about what happened.
In short, Kavanaugh said that he was "insulted by the evils and wrath of the Democratic Party".
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that we would like to reject the unforgivable and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," Shortas said in his speech in Willing, West Virginia.
In short, Kavanaugh said that during his candidacy process, he experienced "the ills of the democratic party, anger".
Kavanaugh testified on Thursday to the congress strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were still a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans saw on that day what Kavanaugh was like, loud, and courageous.
– The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, he is a lawyer who has a reliable reputation for public services," he said to the West Virginia sponsors.
The President referred indirectly to the candidacy of Kavanaugh, together with the importance of the Republican elections in the middle elections.
"The most important elections in our lives have remained for five weeks.
I don't participate, though I'm really participating,' he said.
– That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
A brief statement was made that the Democrats were seeking to "oppose and hinder".
The Senior Assistant Head of the GOP said that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday.
The number of victims of drought and tsunami in Indonesia continues to increase
The authorities reported that at least 384 people had died, many had been killed because of huge waves that were inundated to the beach, when strong earthquakes and tsunamis hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.
On Friday, these people gathered at the city beach festival in Palu, where they gathered to the shore to try out the six-metre wave of height. Most of them were fatally relieved and destroyed everything that happened on the road.
After the tsunami, an earthquake of 7.5 bullets occurred.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away right away, so they became victims,” said Mr. Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the BNPB Agency for Disaster Reduction in Indonesia during the information report.
“Cunamis didn’t blow up alone, he pulled cars, castles, houses, he hit everything on the ground”, said Nugroho and added that, before hitting the coast, the tsunamis ran at 800 km/h.
He said that some people slipped into trees to avoid tsunamis and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24 centers in Palus.
The photos of the crash agency from the air showed that many buildings and shops had been destroyed, and bridges had been torn down and bridges collapsed, and the castle was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the city of departure continued to be shaken by repeated beatings.
Earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported that, on Friday, a particularly severe earthquake caused energy to rise about 200 times above the nuclear bomb, which was hit by Hiroshima during World War II.
It was reported that the tsunamis could have been strengthened by the city’s geographical location, as it lay at the end of a long, narrow valley.
Nugroho described the damage as "great" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped in the ruins of the buildings, later added to the damage of 540 people, and 29 people died without knowledge.
Nugroho said that the number and damage of the victims may be higher along the coast than 300 km north of Pala, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Nugroho said the communication networks were "completely paralysed and therefore no information was received" from Dongal.
"There are more than 300,000 people living," said the representative of the Red Cross, adding that workers and volunteers are taking part in disaster-affected areas.
It has been said that "it can already be seen as a tragedy, but the situation can be even worse."
On Saturday, the agency was highly criticized for not reporting that the tsunamis hit Paul, even though officials said that the gangs had left after the warning was issued.
In the general social media sample, you can hear a man standing on the top floor of a building calling for a coming tsunami for people down the street.
Within a few minutes, the water wall runs into the coast, sending buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately approve the filmed materials.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, electricity supply was disrupted and communications networks around Palus were lost and it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate the provision of aid.
The authorities reported that the Jakarta military and other cities began to send cargo aircraft with aid supplies, but the evacuated persons still need food and other essential goods.
The airport was reopened only to provide aid and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the Palus evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
Doseb reported that when the World Vision staff from Dongal traveled safely to the city of Palu, where the workers lay in the homeless tents built in the yard of the office, the images were taken away.
"They told me that they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups started taking difficult steps to provide disaster relief, some people complained that those with a lot of experience in foreign aid had been banned from travelling to Palu.
Under the Indonesian regulations, funding, care and foreign personnel can only help when the disaster area is announced in the national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still an accident at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
– When the government says, “Yes, it is a national disaster”, we can call for international aid, but such status has not yet been published.”
On the second night after the earthquake on Friday and tsunami Paul, close friends and relatives hoped that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would affect the noose’s history of natural disasters.
A small boy was taken out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been laid down two days after her mother’s fall.
Coach Gendon Subdono, a national sports team in Indonesia, was trained by two talented Asian athletes who ended up in Indonesia earlier this month.
Other members of Roa Roa's hotel, including Mandag, were his students.
"Since I am an elder in the field of sports, I bear my emotional burden," he said.
Gendonas told us very little about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in a few hours. He sent messages through the WhatsApp program to the Palus competitors who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages contained only one grey, not two blue threads.
"I think this means that messages have not been received," he said.
When the ATM was filled, Newport on the Levee stole 26 750 US dollars
According to a press release from the Niuport Police Department, on Friday morning, the thief stole 26 750 US dollars from a staff member of the Brink's, who filled the ATM at the Newport on the Levee.
"The driver of the car was a ATM banker in the entertainment complex and was ready to add more money," said Detective Dennis McCarthy in a press release.
While he was busy, the other man “came from behind the back of the Brink’s employee” and stole to supplement the money bag.
According to the press report, the Witnesses noticed a number of suspects who ran from the scene, but the police were unable to identify the number of persons involved in the crime.
Any person who has information about their identity should contact the Niuport police by telephone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. Reperis changed his name to Ye
Reperis Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, after announcing the changes in Twitter, he wrote: “A person previously known as Kanye West”.
For 41 years, K. West has been known as Ye and on this behalf named the eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes began before the show "Saturday Night Live", where West was expected to present its new album "Yandhi".
He has to replace the singer Ariana Granda, who called off the performance for "emotional reasons," said the creator of the show.
This is not only a reduction in the current professional name – Mr. West said earlier that this word has religious significance for him.
“I think yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you”,” – this year K. West said earlier when referring to the name of the album with the radio director Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and it's just Ye, which means the reflection of our good, bad, panic, everything.
The album is more reflective of what we are."
He's one of many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced the name of Love and Brotherly Love.
Former Westo colleague JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without his or her capital letters.
Mexican policy Andrés Manuel López Obradar (short AMLO) promises not to use war against civilians.
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrodaras, promised never to use military forces against civilians when the country was approaching 50 bloody repression against students annually.
On Saturday, López Obradar promised at Tlatelolco "never use military forces to disturb Mexicans".
On October 2, 1968, at the time of the movement of left-wing students throughout Latin America, military personnel shot at a peaceful demonstration in the field and 300 people were killed.
López Obrador made a solemn promise to support young Mexicans each month by subsidizing students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education include young people in criminal groups.
The US should double the funding for artificial intelligence
"Since China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount released for research in this field," says the investor and artificial intelligence specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were received after the various US government bodies published reports on artificial intelligence, even the fact that the US is not in general an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year – the goal of leading up to 2030 in the field of artificial intelligence innovation.
"The enhanced research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the USA and are expected in the field of other breakthroughs in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Co-financing could double the likelihood that another great achievement of artificial intelligence will be the USA, as Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director-General of Synovation Ventures, investing in one of China's most important artificial intelligence companies, and is the director-general of the company "Face++".
In the 1980s, he worked with an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the top-ranking American player Othello, and was later head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has recognised previous US government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when there will be others to help find more intelligent people.
Lee said that U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win state grants.
"It's not China taking academic leaders away, it's companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired bright universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that developments in immigration policy can also help the US strengthen its efforts on artificial intelligence.
"I think that doctors working in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published its New Generation artificial intelligence development plan.
In addition, Lee said that the Chinese National Science Fund is funded by academic institutions, similar to the National Science Fund and other government organisations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which aims to include partners from the industry and the academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA (the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency) announced an investment of US$ 2 billion for the AI Next initiative.
NSF is currently investing more than US$ 100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, in the coming months, nothing has been done about US legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The Macedonians voted in Sunday's referendum on whether to replace the country's name with the name of the Republic of North Macedonia would be an action to resolve a ten-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is in the province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents claims to the territory of Greece and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments agreed on the proposed new name, but opponents say that the change of name would affect the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian celebrities.
President Gjorge Ivanova said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts as to whether voters' activity would reach the minimum 50% needed for the referendum to enter into force.
The issue of the referendum on the ballot card was put forward: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU in favour of an agreement with Greece?"
The sponsors of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that have fallen behind Yugoslavia, is worth the price to pay to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the country's future, the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely, are protected by the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members said that they would respect the results of the vote and make them decisive.
The title is to be replaced by two-thirds of the majority in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission reported that there were no reports of infringements up to 1 p.m.
However, voters’ activity reached only 16 percent compared to 34 percent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of voters gave their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old President of Skopje.
Macedonian Parliamentlor Zoran Zaevas, his wife Zorica and his son Duška are voting in a referendum on the change of country name to open the way for NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled the chairs in front of the tents, which were built by the boycotting referendum.
"We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads raised rather than enter the door of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
– We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can return to others, such as China and Russia, and participate in the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaevas says that NATO membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent, will attract the necessary investments.
"I believe that the vast majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are favourable to the EU and NATO," Zaevas said after giving his vote.
He said that the "Yes" result would be "a guarantee of our future".
According to the poll results published by the Macedonian Research Institute on Monday, 30 to 43 percent of voters should participate in the referendum – less than the required voter activity.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV Telma, 57 per cent of respondents are preparing to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote "Yes".
In order for the referendum to take place successfully, it must be attended by 50 per cent of voters plus one vote.
If the referendum did not succeed, it would have been the first serious failure of the pro-Kerat government policy since it took over power last May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero defeats all Brighton's defense and profit consumption
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defense, and the Manchester City team on Saturday, playing at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, won the victory at 2:0.
Aguero's 65-minute intake was inflamed, apparently unlikely.
The Argentine attacker got the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
Before going out into the open field, he passed between the three Brighton defenders.
At that time, Aguero was surrounded by four green players who were pulling their trolleys.
He ran through one defender, before that, the Brighton penalty court was on the edge of a few others.
Then he transferred the ball to the left where Sterling was.
The British attacker, with one blow from the fine court, returned the ball to Aguero, and this right-wing blow launched the ball to the right side of the gate network, overcoming the Brighton well of Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said the city leader Pepas Guardiola.
– We talked about him playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were told that at that moment he earned a living."
However, it was Sterling that helped the first Sky Blues to move forward in these Primer League matches.
The consumption won the 29th minute.
At the time of Aguero's attack, the ball was found at the bottom of Brighton Square.
In addition to the left, the border between the two opponents was beautifully transferred to Leroy’s Sane.
In Sane’s path, the sparrows pushed the ball forward until Sterling swirled toward the further rope.
The Sky Blues attacker launched the ball at the door just outside the edge of the field.
On Tuesday, 12 a.m. 55 minutes, City meets with the Hoffenheim Championship league group at the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Zinsheim (Germany).
Sherzer wants to play friendly games with Rockies
After the Nationals dropped out of the volleyballs, there was no longer any significant reason to force them.
After a competitive decision by Scherzer, he hopes to win Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still has the chance to remain in the volleyballs; in the national league "West", they run the Los Angeles Dodgers.
“Rockies” on Friday evening, with 5:2 winning “Nationals”, has at least secured the chance to get a pass, but will still have to try to ensure the right to play in the first division.
"Although we are playing for nothing, at least we will be able to escape to the square knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where people and other teams are going to meet, will probably be at the highest level we can reach this year.
Why don't you just sit down?"
On Sunday, the Nationals team's start team has not yet announced, but in this case they're clearly willing to throw the ball out of Scherser.
Scherser, who will be in the building of this game on Thursday 34th, became a fitness coach and a medical position for him to take a normal day of rest on Sunday.
The statistics of the right-hand Washington season: 18-7, 2,53 ERA and 300 cars over 220 2/3 of the hill.
Short speech in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of the electoral activity of the Republicans in the mid-term elections, the President indirectly recalls the situation regarding the appointment of Bretto Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“All that we have achieved will be put on the table in November.
Up to five weeks remained the most important election in our lives.
It's very important, I'm not running... but actually running, that's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Then he went on: – You see this horrible, horrible group of democrats, you see how this is happening right now.
And they're willing to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how bad it is.
They don't care what they've stored, what they've been through to get power and control; that's what they really want – power and control – but we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, have the mission to "oppose and prevent".
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "the angry, the terrible, the dead, and the wrong people."
He referred to the Senate Courts Committee, referring to the name of Senator Dianne’s Feinstein, which caused great ovulation of listeners.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, um, how.
No, um... no, I'm waiting for one – it was really a simple language of the body – the simplest language of the body from all I've seen."
Leborists have lost a variety of opinions.
They do not tolerate those who openly express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party voted in favour of my mistrust, I say it was necessary to observe.
Finally, I am the latest of the Lebanese parliamentarians who have been told that I am undesirable – and this is for what I have said.
My colleague, Mr Ryan, was faced with similar threats because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
My disbelief was expressed in criticizing me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironic, on similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday that "we want many members to participate in the meetings and that meetings will be productive."
Most of the eight years when I was a local parliamentary member of the Labour Party, the meeting of the GC on Friday evening was exactly the same.
It is sad that today's tone of many meetings is not exactly the same and the promises of a "seriouser, more pleasant" policy have long been forgotten, even if in general it has ever been realized.
It is increasingly evident that the other opinion is intolerable and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party to be led.
This began shortly after the party leader became Jeremy, and colleagues, whom I thought were similar, and my previous political views, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and follow the opinions I would never agree with – either on national security or on the EU single market.
As soon as I speak in public – and no matter what – the social media are investigating the violations that encourage my withdrawal, the central policy is being condemned and it is said that I do not have a place in the Lebanese party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I have achieved something far more than some of my colleagues because the comments I have made are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to endure daily sexual and racist abuses.
One of the most depressing things in this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Last week Jeremy Corby said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party of the same views, and with every 'intrust' procedure or amendment of the electoral system, this party is becoming less and less.
In the last two years, I have received much advice to keep quiet and not speak out loud, and then “everything will be fine ” with me.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, I have been a scientist who has been provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which has really broken my whole class of schools in that sense, trying to save better public services for those who need it most – whether a local council member or a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my policies, including recent elections.
No one in the Nottingham East had to be surprised in any way by my political opinions and by my disagreement with the current leaders.
To those who promoted this procedure on Friday, I can say that when the country moves towards Brexit's, from which households, businesses and public services will suffer, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Leborist Party.
But in fact, one message I have for my electors, members of the Labour Party (or not): I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats to the revocation or political accuracy will prevent me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and all your best interests.

“Ayr”- “Melrose” – 38:17 Unaffected “Ayr” beats tabletops
Two late tests to the extent that the final results were distorted, but there is no doubt that Air won this triumph's impressive moment in the events of Tennent's Premiership.
Now the team is at the top of the table – the only one not affected.
Finally, they were given the opportunity to defend themselves and make good use of the opportunity, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
"We've taken all the tests through all the matches that have been done so far and we're still not going through, so I'm really happy," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said "Ayr" turned out to be good, the players took advantage of their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute trial, which was successfully completed by Frazier Climus, led to Air, but the yellow card to shoot Rory Hughes, which was released by Warriers, allowed Melrose to collect the numbers and Baggot stopped the non-resultive test.
The climate increased the advantage of Air when before, in the middle of the race, it earned points and successfully completed the personal test by helping Air before the break-up result 17:5.
However, Melrose's second climb started fine, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which was successfully completed by Baggota, reduced the gap to five points.
The matches were suspended for a longer time because Ruaridhas Knottas had suffered a severe trauma and was left out of sight on the carriages. After the extended air games continued to move forward when the trial of Stafford McDowall resulted in a successful completion of the climate.
Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose tried to exploit the player's surplus, but Bruce's Colvin's test was unsuccessful after the low pressure.
The home team player returned, however, after receiving a yellow card from Straan Hutchinson for stopping the Clim without a ball, MacPherson from the fine line pushed the ball for the occupied "Ayr" caves.
The climate successfully completed its test, as it had already done since almost the beginning of the match, after Kyle Rowe held David Armstrong's arm to the corner of the square and stopped the country's attacker Gregor Henry from holding the fifth attempt by the home team to win points.
"Still Game" star, apparently ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
The "Still Game" star Ford Kiernana seems to be ready to move to the housing and catering services sector after explaining that the director of the licensed restaurant company has been appointed.
A 56-year-old man in the popular BBC comedy plays Jack Jarvis, writes scripts and plays together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The duet announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last season of this show, and it seems Kiernana is already planning her life after Kraiglang.
In official data, he became the Director of Aragingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this fact, although the sources of the Scottish Sun noted that Kiernana was looking for ways to engage in the "professed restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"We belong to the sea": Bolivia is incarcerated in the ground, hoping that the court will reopen its way to the water
The sailors are patrolling the ship at La Pase.
On public buildings there is a watermelon flag.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the base of the sea is filled with a shout: “We are legally owned by the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, there are still vivid memories of access to the water, which had to be sacrificed to Chile by means of resources in the 19th century.
In recent decades, the hopes of the World Court of Justice, which will be published on 1 October, have been greatly strengthened, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice after five years' consideration.
"Bolivia has a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is willing to wait for positive results," said Bolivia's diplomat Robert Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens throughout the country will monitor the publication of the TTT decision on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will take a positive decision on Bolivia’s complaint – Chile will be obliged to negotiate on Bolivia’s access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia, who is awaiting a counter-election campaign for re-election, is also very interested as soon as the decision on Monday ends.
"We are very close to getting back to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts would like to believe that it is unlikely that the court will take a decision in favour of Bolivia, even if it does, there is little change.
The United Nations institution established in the Netherlands has no power to intercept the territory of Chile and has indicated that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the TTT decision will only be published six months after the last arguments were heard hardly or shows that the case was "not difficult", said Paz Zarate, expert in international law in Chile.
And even if Bolivia had been able to do something about it, for the past four years, it could have been blocked back.
"This issue of access to the sea has been raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She believes that any remnant of Chile's good will has been destroyed by the crusader of Morales.
Bolivia and Chile will be able to continue the conversation at some point, but after all this discussion will be extremely difficult.
The country has not changed its ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court decision was taken unusually quickly.
"In the spring, Bolivia will have the unique opportunity to start a new relationship with Chile and to end the 139-year-old disagreements for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, and uses the sea as a political manipulation.
"Bolivia will never promise to have the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must agree with the past."
North Korea argues that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the United States
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho believes that his people will never return the first nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises, which the leaders of the rival countries agreed on at the Singapore meeting.
His comments were made at a time when the Secretary of State, Mike`s Pompey, apparently intended to renew the nuclear diplomacy that had been established more than three months after the meeting with Kim Jong Unu in Singapore.
Ri says that "a utopian dream" is that the continuation of sanctions and the US of the declaration on the end of the Korean war could ever be blocked by North Korea.
Washington is not in favour of the declaration unless, first of all, the Pchenjana has committed credible disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Short wants to hold a second meeting.
But the widespread sceptical opinion that the Pchenjan is not seriously going to give up the arsenal that the country seems to see as the only guarantor of its security.
Pompey intends to visit Pchenjane next month to prepare the ground for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show was revealed that the latest trend is massive head coverings, and they will soon close the nearest fashion shops
If you want to add your bird collection or completely protect from the sun, this trend is just like you.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentricly large head coverings in their spring and summer collections in 2019, and he just caught sight of Paris’s fashion week.
This summer, these particularly impractical airplanes blocked the social network "Instagram" and these designers presented eye-catching works on the podium.
The distinguished work of Valentino was a huge body coloring flyer, surrounded by a wide, wing-mechanical landscape that covered the manikin’s head.
Other non-standard-sized accessories have been adorned with precious stones, amber and even anacondas – but they are not designed to protect your head from cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange cowboys – at the same time to Helovin.
Many colorful blankets were bound with lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than the high fashion.
One of the works looked like a member's costume, with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other remembered the soluble ice sheet.
And if you get this huge fashion trend, don't ask.
Stylish experts believe that these large covers can enter shops.
The big birds were still popular with the La Bomba high-pitched, and the two-legged birds were all coming from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand of the goods, which created extremely impractical shelters that shut down all social networks, placed another large piece on the podium – a narrow beach basket, almost the same size as the one wearing a bathing suit to pull a manikin.
The basket of red-plated paint rafies, decorated with rafie corners and white leather handle, became the exclusive accent of the Jacquemus collection "La Riviera SS19" during the Paris fashion week.
Familiar Luke-Armitage-Stylist FEMAIL said: “I think that next summer the big airplanes and beach bags will be brought back to the shops because the designer has had such a great impact, so it would be difficult to ignore the need for non-standard-sized accessories.”
John Edward: “The payment of talks is an extremely important training for the world’s citizens”
The independent schools of Scotland have improved the record of academic achievements in 2018 and have again demonstrated the exceptional results of the exams, which have only been further strengthened by individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community benefits.
When more than 30,000 students are taught throughout Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), aims to provide their students and their parents with the highest level of services.
Independent schools aim to train their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and to be citizens of the world.
As we work in the education sector, which can create and implement the school programme, we see that modern languages continue to remain popular and are willing to collect them in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you can speak to a person, he will understand you.
If you speak to him himself, you shall speak to his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we cannot only speak English if we want to build trust and trust in people from other countries.
According to the results of this year's recent exams, languages are well-known in the top of the population and in independent schools are the best maintenance rankings.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students received the highest A rating.
The data collected from 74 schools, which are members of SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A score during the Mandarin language exam, the highest A score was 72 percent in German, and the highest A score was 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland take the time to pay for foreign languages with the essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as an optional subject are now considered to be important in independent school programmes and elsewhere as basic subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
According to a survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014, 17% of all the reasons why jobs were difficult to fill were insufficient in language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory for young people to prepare for their future careers.
Since employment in the future will depend heavily on languages, these skills in the globalizing world become essential.
No matter what career a person would choose when he would learn a second language, he would in the future be much more proficient than others if he had all the skills he needed in life.
With the ability to communicate directly with people from abroad, a person learning a few languages will be much more competitive.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 involving more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were not able to speak in a foreign language well enough to participate in the conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken in which a double percentage of people, i.e. 15 percent.
That is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
In a number of languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In school, each school varies according to the language they are taught.
Many schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom in view of the future of 2020, such as Mandarins or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, there will always be many languages from which you can choose in an independent school with training staff and specialists in this area.
School independent schools are prepared to develop a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to live in the future.
It is not denied that today the world’s business environment remains a language of vital importance for the future of a country, so it is also necessary to reflect it in the education system.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity to choose, diversity and results for young people in Scotland.
It is necessary to do so.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent School Council
LeBron will start the "Lakers" debut on Sunday.
There was little waiting for the fans to see how LeBron James would start the Los Angeles Lakers season.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton reported that James would play the opening of the Sunday season with Denver Nuggets San Diego.
But just a few minutes of play, I still don't get it.
"This will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell on Twitter said James is likely to play a limited time.
As early as this week, James was asked about plans in the Lakers team during six pre-season games.
"At this stage of my career, I no longer need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Short speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Short this evening starts his campaign in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned short-term languages next week, including braking in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In voting on the suspension procedure for the candidate of the Supreme Court chosen by him, the short-term aim is to focus support in the forthcoming mid-term elections, as the Republics were threatened with losing control in Congress in November.
The following hour will take place this evening in Short language in West Virginia, and how can you monitor it online?
Short speech in Willing, West Virginia, scheduled for 19 o'clock in the evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the short language in West Virginia on the internet in the following version of "YouTube".
The theme of the Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh will be briefly discussed this week, because it has put much stress on the suspicions of improper sexual behaviour when the Senate voted to suspend the nomination of the candidate until the week before the FTB conducts the investigation.
But the main objective of this campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength in the coming November elections.
Therefore, the representatives of the campaign of President Trumpo said that the purpose of these five meetings next week, as Reuters is announced, is to "energize volunteers and supporters who are trying to defend and extend the majority of the Republics they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"Congress control is so important on its agenda that the president will go to as many countries as possible, because the campaign season is beginning very hot," said Hurmpu campaign representative, reluctant to reveal his name.
"The language planned in the Wesbanco arena should attract sponsors from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of Pittsberg's media," says Metro News in West Virginia.
On Saturday, Shorty will visit West Virginia, in a country where more than 40 percentage points have won in 2016.
A brief effort is being made to help the West Virginia candidate to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is according to the polls in the rankings.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to get him to the top of the rankings," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, as Reuters reports.
2018 Ryder Tournament Tournament: United States team assigned troops and expected to enter Sunday's unit races
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, the quartz can be just what was needed during this Ryder Tournament.
Such a course of success is totally designed, but players really believe it, especially in such games as this.
So whose side is success now?
"They've led by six points, and now by four, so I guess we can keep it such a success," said Jordan Speithes, preparing for the day.
Europe, of course, is the first one, has a four-point overlap and is still waiting for twelve matches.
American enthusiasm, says Spietho, has faded, and they do not miss it, no longer speaking about the shape of Spietho and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each gathered three points out of four.
Spythe was invincible from the beginning to the end and was irreprehensiblely directed.
As the round went on, those wild wins all sounded loud. To finish the fourth match, Thomas earned two points out of two possibilities.
His defeat, winning them in this mother's 15th duel, was accompanied by similar tricks that seemed to say the end of the American team was not yet coming.
"You just need to focus and take care of your own games," Spies said.
Now each of these players has been played separately.
Until the successful end – 18 gift boxes.
The only players who have collected more points for Spythe and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, the story of the Ryder Cup is undisputed.
A strange but beautiful couple from Europe have gathered four points out of four possibilities and can be quiet.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't need any extra hits not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and on Friday morning.
The course of these events and the reaction of the smiling viewers only confirms that they will be the players who will win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve a popularity such as Fleetwood or Molinauri, which will have the chance to win Europe after the last launch of the Le Golf National.
It would be good to meet both at the same time.
Although it is too early to talk about Europe's fame.
Bubba Watson and Webba Simpson played briefly with Sergio Garcia, a four-ball club in the morning when he was hanging with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles during the first nine rounds of punched Spanish and swooped into trouble from which they could not escape.
But on Sundays, no one will get out of trouble.
Four cats and four cats are so interesting to observe for the interaction between couples, for the advice they give and for which they do not give, and for the strategy to change instantly.
Europe has played better as a team, so it has come to the final with a strong lead, but this fourth stage has also shown that the U.S. team has a fighter pillar, which some, especially in the states, doubted.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup Europe top 10:6
Europe will meet the final day of the Ryder Cup with a major over-the-counter, after the fourth stage of the Saturday, leading against the United States result 10:6.
Inspiring Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario's duet continued to heat the atmosphere by winning two victories against the hard fighting Tiger Woods and taking the lead at four Le Golf National points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, in order to preserve the trophies that Hazeltine had lost two years ago, dominated in the early fourth match against the unsuccessful American side and ended the stage with a result of 3:1.
The U.S. demonstrated more opposition in the four quarters when it won two cats but was unable to overcome the points.
The side of Jim Furyk needs eight points of 12 units running on Sunday to keep the trophies in their hands.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four points in a row when Molinaru and Molliwood doubled after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second couple who won four points during their first four cats in the history of the Ryder Cup.
When Woods and Patrick Reed were attacked in the fourth century, they irrevocably disturbed the trust lost by Woods and America's new Brison Dechambeau with an even better result 5:4.
Woods, not so defeated two Saturday cats, at some times showed a high level of professionalism, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his cats in four, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose fell asleep at four o'clock in the morning and returned to play with partner Henrik Stenson at four o'clock; they won 2+1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third place in the world rankings.
No matter how pleasant, gentle the windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, Europe is not all about butter.
Three times the winner Jordan Speithes and Justin Thomas took out an American card, winning two points on Saturday.
Four ballmates' mother they sought an easy victory by 2:1 against John Rahma and Ian Poulter in Spain, and the fourth mother defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy’s result by 4:3 without a bullet in the first two pieces.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Tower, the team managed to regain the balance of four points by going to a single cat, even though the Fury side would be equal enough to maintain the trophies.
Although there were two days in the second place, on Sunday the success of them seemed to have disappeared.
North Korea says they won't fight unilaterally in no way without believing
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that the continued sanctions were still deepening their mistrust in the United States and that in such circumstances the country would certainly not unilaterally react to nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly that in recent years North Korea has taken "significant good-will measures", for example, stopped testing of nuclear missiles, dismantled the nuclear test base and committed itself to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"But we did not wait for a similar response from the US," he lamented.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm."
Before Ri heard the North Korean complaints about Washington's phase-by-step approach to nuclear disarmament, according to which the North Koreans would be rewarded at the stages of its action, his statement was based on the fact that he had not completely rejected the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pchenjan had done in the past.
Ri noted the joint statement submitted by Kim Jong Unas and Donald Sumpas during the first meeting of the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed himself to working on "the Korean side of disarmament", and the short promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end of the Korean war from 1950 to 1953, but the United States says that Kenya must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to mitigate the severe international sanctions for North Korea.
"The US requires nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its objective by means of forced-out methods, even by refusing declarations of the end of the war," said Ri.
“To think that sanctions can be blocked is the same as for people we don’t care about to follow utopian dreams.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second meeting of Kim and Short, which was highlighted by the US leader in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings of the leader of Kimo and South Korea, Moon Jae-in in the last five months: "If the other country were South Korea on this nuclear disarmament issue rather than the United States, the issue of nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula would not have been accepted."
However, Ri’s tone of speech changed dramatically compared to last year’s time when he told the UN General Assembly that when “Mr. Bógio’s President” Shortos called Kim “a rocket master” who was preparing a suicide mission, the direction of the North Korean missile to the United States was totally inevitable.
This year in the United Nations Short, which threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, fought for the courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions should remain until North Korea meets the nuclear disarmament requirements.
On Wednesday, Short said it had no time schedule, and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should compensate for the actions taken by Chengian.
However, on Thursday, the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr Pomeo, told the UN Security Council that "the sanctions of the Security Council must be firmly continued without any concessions until complete final evidence has been carried out by nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council, with all its votes, endorsed the sanctions imposed by North Korea since 2006, in order to prevent the financing of the Pchenjan nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pchenjane again next month to clean up the ground for another meeting.
Pompeii had visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was a failure.
In July he left the city of Pchenjan, saying that all progress was just for North Korea to declare after a few hours that he had submitted "gangsterical demands".
During the meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile base and nuclear complex this month if the United States takes "relevant measures".
According to him, Kim said that those "relevant measures" which he was seeking are the security guarantees promised by the short promise in Singapore and will try to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough to rest
The new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all its students to sleep more, to fight the growing culture of the sword in studies, to use caffeine and not to sleep at night
One academic found that at the best university in the world, students often have no basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and Brigam Sichi, a specialist in women's hospitals, prepared a course that, he says, is the first such type of U.S.A.
The inspiration to prepare this course visited him after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the conversation, one girl came to me and said, "Why are you telling me about this only now, in the last year of the study?"
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me," he said "The Telegraph".
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to the students how the most important quality sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results, improve the common sense.
Professor of the Harvard Medical School of Psychiatry and Executive Director of the University of Health Services Paul Barreira said that the university decided to offer this course when it became clear that students were very sleepy within a week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a photo of a shared room where students can click on a cup of coffee, snacks, coaches and books and thus learn about the effect of caffeine, light, how lack of sleep affects sports results and how important it is to go to sleep routine.
In the next section, participants learned how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the student city with interactive icons that encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
"We understand that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the health consequences when you choose to smoke," explained Professor Cheisler.
The culture of growth does not sleep overnight, he says, still exists. Modern technologies and increasing pressure on students have led to the growing problem of lack of sleep.
"In order to ensure that he was sufficiently and qualitatively relaxed, there should be a secret weapon of students in the fight against stress, persecution and anxiety, he said, even avoiding weight gain, because the lack of sleep turns the brain into a mode of hunger, so the students are always hungry."
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler prepare a course when last year, in his first year in Harvard, he attended one of his lectures.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course available to the whole student city.
He hopes that the next step will invite all second-stage students to listen to this course before starting to visit this competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students set up a promise when it is time to go to sleep, as well as rising, and to protect the harmful effects of blue light, which is spread by electronic devices and light diode lighting, because they can shed your circular rhythm from balance, so it can be difficult to sleep.
"Livingston" 1:0 "Rangers": Men's consumption killed Gerard's men
"Rangers" experienced another disappointment when Dolly Mengai Livingstone managed to overcome the depressed Steven Gerard result of 1:0.
"Ibrox" hoped to win his first victory in the run after the February triumph at 4:1 St Johnstone, but Gary Holto's team won Gerrard the second time during the 18th stage and now the last team has eight points left behind from the late leaders of the "Hearts".
Menga was stabbed seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration, the Rangers did not see the possibility of balancing the result.
"Rangers" is now falling to 6th place, "Livingston" has risen to 3rd and is left with only one intruder.
And the Rangers' concern is not over, because it is probably from a tribune butter thing that struck the head of the side judge Calumi Spencui and injured him.
Gerard made four changes that led to the rounding of Air and led to the half-final of the Betfred.
On the other hand, Holt believed the same monologue that took the point out of Hearts last week, and he would be pleased to see how his well-thought combinations brought up opponents in each step.
"Rangers" dominated the control of the ball, but having it, "Livingston" did more.
They were able to get in the second minute when Menga hit the ball near Allan McGregor's door to Scott Pittman, but his chances were secure by turning the ball away from the door.
After a long strike by Keaghan Jacobs, Captain Craig Halkett was reached, but his co-rapporteur Alan Lithgowas asked for the country.
"Rangers" took control, but the last third of the matches were only hopes, not faith in their games.
After 15 minutes, Alfred Morelos was sentenced to a fine when he met Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson handcuffed the Colombian complaint.
In the first row, Rangers managed to hit only twice, but ex-Ibrox was hit by Liam Kelly with poor or enchanted by Lassana Coulibaly's blow of the head or gentle blow of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's 34th-minute consumption may not match the race, no one will dispute that they deserve him for his efforts.
"Rangers" and again failed to overcome Jacob's clever defense.
Scott's Arfield didn't like it when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his self-name and handed it over to Menga for easy completion.
During the break Gerard took action by changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and that exchange almost immediately gave fruit when the country's security defeated Morelos, but after an impressive match, Kelly arrived and pulled the blow.
Livingston included guests in the game that he loved – with the far-off transmissions of the Lithgowo and Halkett ball.
At the end of Holto's team could have raised their pride, but McGregor was protected from the beating of Jacobs after Lithgowa's shot from the corner.
After the change to the square, the Ranger player Glenn Middleton again appealed at the end of the match for the penalty after meeting Jacobs, but Thomson and again he did not.
Germanach: Geigerian numerator inventor
And now the page of our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, today it is already 136 years ago and many years ago... That day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hanss) Geiger was born in Germany.
Geigeris invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity. The invention that later created the device is known as the name of the Geigeri calculator.
Since then, this device has become the world’s scientific hit and later the popular cultural hit, when in the 1950’s, “Bells of Coronado” was played by scientists who did not particularly remember the cowboys Roy” Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “It is a geigerian numerator used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When these ears are sealed, they can actually hear how atoms act, throw radioactive effects into the minerals."
Evans: "Hey, it's really shooting!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, after only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention of his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to develop bad cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to develop bad cells and kill them
Vaccine has been given an immune system to recognise bad cells – this is part of treatment
The method includes the release of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory
Then cells can "see" proteins characterized by many forms of cancer and re-injected
The test vaccine has given many promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
For one woman treated with this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has lasted for more than 18 months.
The method includes the release of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory, then cells can see proteins characterised by HER2 cancers and are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Betesd, Maryland said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
“ HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and direct intestines”, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach when immune cells are derived from patients and are taught to move to cancer cells has been successful in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye's West launched a troupe-supporting tyradius, wearing the MAGA kepurate, after his performance with the SNL show.
Well, that's not over.
After a silent presentation of Saturday Night Live, viewers ridiculed Kanye West, who praised President Donald Trump of the United States; he said he would participate in the 2020 campaign.
On that evening, after performing the third song "Ghost Town", during which he was wearing a hat with the title "Make America Great", he continued to condemn the Democrats and expressed his support for Trump.
"How many times have I had to talk to white people, they said, "How can you like Shorts, because he's a racist?"
Well, if racism were to worry me, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL show began with a comical scene in which Matt Damon complained to the Senate Court of Justice of Bretto Kavanaugh on charges of improper sexual conduct brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this has not been broadcast, the filmed material with West Replicas has been uploaded to social networks by comics Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock has tried to trust this entry from West.
In addition, West complained to the audience that there were discomforts in the back of his head because of his head covering.
"They're worried about me in the back.
He said not to be there with such a hat.
They're mad at me!
They said I reached the bottom," he said, "Washington Examiner."
West continued: “Do you want to see what the ground is? ” He asked.
Start to love."
His statements caused at least twice the uncontested frauds in the audience and the members of the SNL broadcast appeared to be disappointed, as Variety reported. One man said to the media: “The whole study had a fatal silence.”
West was invited to quickly replace the singer Ariana Grande because her ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West swallowed up a lot of his performance by performing the song "I Love It", wearing the "Perrier" bottle costume.
He received support from the conservative leader Candace Turner of the TPUSA group, who announced in the Twitter section: "To one of the bravest souls: TO THE PRESENT MINIAS."
But the interviewers led by Karen Hunter in the Twitter account published a record that West was simply "self and this is extremely wonderful".
"But I choose the NEREMTI person (by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his "art") whose beliefs are a loathsome ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we are also free," she added.
Prior to the start of the show, the rapper in the Twitter account announced that it changed its name and that it is now formally known as Kanye West.
He wasn't the first creator to change his name, but he was on the same path as Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collegiate rapper Snoop Doggas originally called Snoop Lions; the music legend Prince has changed his name to symbol and later became known as Prince.
The charges of killing a mouse at the Belfast restaurant
A 45 - year - old man was accused of murdering a man in the eastern part of Belfast when he was injured by a knife.
According to the police, this incident occurred in Balihakamore.
The defendant is expected to stand before the Court of Justice on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor.
"Wars of Stop" Star Another Harington criticises a distorted view of manhood
Another Harington sounded like a sword-fighting character in John Snau HBO's fantastic adventure series about the Middle Ages "Wars of the World".
But the 31-year-old actor criticises the dog’s giant stereotype. He says that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they should be tough to be respected.
Speaking on "Sunday Times Culture", another said that he thought "something is wrong", and raised a question about how to fight the problem of distorted manhood in #MeToo.
Another, who had been married to a 31-year-old colleague named Rose Leslie, a star of the Sostos Wars, admitted that this theme “has been deeply touched. ”
“I feel that this subject is very touching to me now. Where did we make the mistake of cultivating manhood?” he asked.
"What do we teach grown men that we face such problems?"
Another believes that because of this distorted pattern of manhood, television could be responsible because it creates very male characters.
He continued: “Who is born again, and what is taught?
What is taught on television or on the street, so that young people are convinced that they need to be guided by such a type of headship?
I think this is one of the important issues of our time – how can we change it?
Clearly, young men and I made a mistake somewhere."
He also confirmed in the interview that he would not participate in any of the anti-wars or continuums when the next summer's show ended and said that "he already had enough fighting fields and horses".
Since November, another film by Samo Shepard True West has been in the modern version. It's a film about the shooting of film directors and his brother.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him when he was building the Soste War – there he met his wife Rose.
"In this series I met my wife, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and a future life," he said.
The "Emmy" award in the fantastic Rose series was played by Igrit, the object of John Snow's other character.
The couple married Leslie in June 2018 at the property of the family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases of disease 14 %
China reports an increase of 14 % of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 people were infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most newly infected people were sexually transmitted, and this differs from previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection in some parts of China is rapidly spreading due to infected blood clots.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has declined almost to zero, indicating the representatives of the Chinese health authorities during a conference in the province of Junan.
Over time, however, HIV infection and the number of people living with AIDS in China increased to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV by sex is an issue of concern in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China has been decriminalized in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT persons has been widespread.
As conservative values prevail in the country, 70 to 90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually lead women.
Most cases of infection occur due to inappropriate protective measures in such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as one of the ways to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the workers have leaked data from the Republican Senator, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied the suspicion that one of her employees had published personal information from three United States senators on the Wikipedia page of lawmakers.
Los Angeles Democrat believed that the accusations were made by ultra-right wing experts and websites.
"Meas, lie and again no lie," said Waters in his Twitter account.
It is reported that there were also United States Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike ́s Lee and Orrin Hatcho, both from Juto, home addresses and telephone numbers.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill at the time of the Senate's allegations of improper sexual conduct against the candidate Brett Kavanaughi.
The missing information appeared a little later when these three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
"Conservatories' websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have been notified that the IP address, according to which the source of these records was identified, is related to the Waters Bureau and information from the Waters staff member has been disclosed," .
"These unjustified suspicions are completely uncertain and absolute lies," continued Waters.
"My staff member whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these false and false suspicions is in no way responsible for the destruction of this information.
These unwarranted suspicions are completely uncertain and absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly became critical of the Internet, as well as of the press of former White House representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds bad," Fleischer wrote.
“It says that it does not have enough self-reliance to be a Congressman.
If anyone is accused of things he has not done, he should not be offended.
He shouldn't be defending.
He should not doubt the accused’s motives.
He should be calm and humble."
It seems that Fleischer tried to compare the Waters reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry at the Thursday session.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who participated in the mid-term election campaign to change Waters, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"True, if you don't lie," he wrote.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office informed the relevant institutions and law enforcement bodies about these false accusations.
"We will make sure that the organizers are explained, she continued, that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my staff without exception."
A review of the comedy "Jonis Ingliša again" – an exciting exhibition of snowflakes with Rowan Atkinson
The tradition has already become the focus of Brexit in any British film. The same can be said of the restoration of the French comedy "John English" – "John English" was started to show again in 2003, and in 2011 he returned to the screens with the comedy "John English Rise".
Will this sarcastic self-satisfaction about how we have clearly taken over become a new option for national exports?
Whatever the case, the unqualified John English with wide eyes and rubber face has the second opportunity to ascend to the surface of unpleasant truths, since the very name clearly indicates that this comedy work is intended for non-English cinematographer regions.
Of course, this wobbling secret agent, who, although he has a claim to profit, acquired and a little inspector Clouseau's properties, a little of Mr. Byno's features and a stick of similarity to that man, suggests that which was used during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games to create the theme "Fire Transport".
He is also a bit based on the person about the traveler and the mysterious man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV advertising.
This latest John English movie has several beautiful moments.
I liked it when John the English approached the helicopter, pulling a middle - aged suit and scarves, and the artist’s rotor came into his cold.
The comical Atkinson talent is obvious, but the humor itself seems to be inhaled and strangely redundant, especially when serious movie brands such as 007 and "Mission impossible", boldly insert the elements of the comedy.
The humor is like being used to children rather than adults, and I don't believe the adventures of John English don't seem as inventive and peaceful as the silent jokes of Atkinson playing Mr. Byne.
Today’s most common theme is that Britain was in serious trouble.
The cybernet hacker successfully hacked into Britain's highly hidden network of snakes and exposed the identities of all of Britain's snakes in this area, causing the agent's outrage – a too insignificant role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop in the Prime Minister's cup of empastic and angled character, which is already suffering from the blushing political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of Teresa May expresses everything he can, but in the script, good materials are not enough.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents is revealed and that she will have to look for people among those who have retired.
This means that you're going to have to go to John English himself, a school director currently working in some requesting institution, but providing an illegal lesson as a secret agent. Here were some good jokes when English offered a School of Rock ski academy.
English sends back to Violet to discuss the extraordinary situation and there agrees for a long time to its common Bough, which is again known as Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a captain of the submarine, and Vicki Pepperdine, a high - altitude girl, seems to be underexploited.
So Batman and Robin, who are able to interfere with all the affairs of His Majesty's secret service, again takes action and meets with Olga Kurylenko, a fatally beautiful Ophelija Bulletin.
The Prime Minister is threatened by a charismatic billionaire saying he can solve the problem of British computers, i.e. malicious Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odists: redesigned by the fans, they cause fire in the French restaurant, cause chaos in the luxury Volta yacht, and English starts a complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality ears to meet the interior of the Volta house.
All the stops were clear to support this last series, but whatever it is pleasant or wild, all of this reminds children of the television.
It's pretty mean.
As with other English movies, I couldn't get rid of the idea: the unadulterated British film industry can't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really be worth his talent?
The Labour Party denies a plan for the British for four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyna is planning to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but to pay for five days.
It is reported that the party wants the company leaders to share the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution (DI) by giving their employees one day off.
This would allow workers to enjoy three days a week and at home to share the same amount of remuneration.
The source says that this idea is in line with the Party's economic agenda and plans for targeting the country's development workers.
The transition to four working days weeks was also welcomed by the Congress of the Professional Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the benefits of the changing economy.
One of the sources of the high-ranking Leborist Party The Sunday Times said: "The review of the political provisions is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but a four-day week is in line with the party's approach to economic balance for the benefit of employees, as well as the overall strategy of the party's industry."
The Leborist Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party also promised a four-day public election campaign during 2017.
However, this idea is currently not supported by the entire Lebanese party.
The representative of the Laborist Party said: "The Party's policy is not a weekend and this is not considered in the Party."
The shadow government representative John McDonellis took advantage of the opportunity to present his vision at the conference last week of the Labour Party in the field of the socialist revolution.
Mr. McDonellis said he was willing to recover power from "unfair dictators" and "profit hunters" in municipal service companies.
Such shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all their share, because in view of the flight done, the Lebanese government may have something to report.
It also approved plans to include employees in the Board of Directors and to create ownership funds to transfer 10 % of the capital of private sector enterprises to employees and to receive up to GBP 500 annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the question "60 Minutes" whether an FTB study on B. Kavanaugh can change their opinion
In the case of an investigation by Judge Brett Kavanaughi, the FTB was suspended at least one week after the final vote, whether he was appointed to the Supreme Court, so the question arises as to whether the facts to be clarified by the Bureau of Investigation could affect the views of any Republican senators in such a way as to prevent them from taking this judge.
In an interview on Sunday evening, the 60-minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asks Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it can happen in such a way that the FTB will find out something that will change their opinion.
Senator Kennedy seems to be more liberal than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Well, yes, of course," replied Mr. Kennedy.
“As I said when I went to the meeting, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened when the charges came, I called him and asked him, “Did you do that? ”
He answered firmly, firmly, indistinguishably."
Therefore, Mr Graham's opinion seems to be unchangeable.
"I've decided on Bretto Kavanaugh, which should be a serious accusation," he says.
“Ford – I don’t know what was there, but I know one: Brettas is categorically negative,” added Mr Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one, as she says, can approve it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything new will turn up."
What is the Festival of the World's Citizens and did it contribute to poverty reduction as a matter of fact?
This Saturday will be a World Citizens' Festival in New York, an annual music event that shows an impressive number of stars and aims at the least impressive goal of eradicating poverty in the world.
For the past seven years, the World Civilian Festival of the Central Park will reach tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawnas Mendess, but will also spread more information about the real purpose of the event – to eliminate particularly great poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival was launched in 2012. It will continue the World Fight against Poverty Project – an international mediation group that aims to eliminate poverty by actively increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless he wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform various tasks or actions, such as engaging in volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world’s leader, calling the phone, or otherwise helping to increase awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
However, are the people of the world successfully pursuing this goal? 12 years have elapsed until the deadline.
Is the idea of comparing people to a free concert really going to convince them to demand and encourage them to act? Maybe it's just another example of so-called clickivism, fictional activation, people think you'll really change the situation by signing an online petition or posting a post on Twitter.
According to the World Citizens' Festival organizers, since 2011, the movement has recorded more than 19 million of its supporters' actions, encouraging the achievement of many of the various objectives.
They say that, under the pressure of these actions, the world leaders have announced 37 billion US dollars' worth of commitments and policy strategies that plan to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group indicated 390 commitments and statements that the Group's actions have already received or collected at least US$ 10 billion.
It is estimated that almost 649 million people around the world have been directly affected by the funds provided.
Among some key commitments can be mentioned "The Power of Nutrition" – a partnership between investors and executives operating in the United Kingdom, which aims to "help children to grow and discover their full potential". After more than 4,700 messages from the World Citizens Twitter, she promised to provide Rwanda with US dollars to help solve the food shortage in the country.
"With the support of the United Kingdom governments, supporters, governments of countries and such as you, the citizens of the world, we can achieve that social injustices such as malnutrition of food will become a thing of the past," said Ambassador Tracey Ulllman, who met in London in April 2018.
This group also indicated that after receiving 5 000 applications in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "Power of Manhood" project, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In replying to one of the FAQs that asks "Why do you think we can eliminate a particularly great poverty?",
The world’s citizens answer: “This is a long and difficult path — sometimes we get into a fight and we’re going to fail.
However, like the great movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win because we are all stronger together."
Janet Jackson, "The Weeknd", Shawnas Mendess, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the performers participating in this year's event in New York. The event will be held by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
As said by the Secretary of the Interior, the US can use the fleet to block Russian energy exports
"If necessary, Washington can use the ship to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, as well as the Middle East markets," says US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner.
R. Zinke says that Russia's participation in Syria, especially when it acts as a legitimate invitation to the government, is a pretext based on the research of new energy markets.
"I think that Russia is involved in the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy field, as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," said R. Zincke.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to address this issue.
"The United States can do this by using a ship, can make sure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, can run a block, make sure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
R. Zincke said this to participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called the US "Energy Consumers' Voice".
He then compared Washington's methods with those that apply to the issues of Russia and Iran, and noted that they are essentially equal.
"Iran and Russia's economic alternative is to find a greater or lesser balance to change fuel," he also called Russia a country whose entire economy is dependent solely on fossil fuels.
These statements have appeared to the Short Administration in the mission to increase their liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace Russia on the market, which offers European consumers a much cheaper opportunity.
Therefore, the officials of the Short administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the wrong North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Dr. Trump, has become free of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion value of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is just an economic project.
In the Kremlin's view, the cause of the opposition to this project in Washington is only economic, which is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a pressure measure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position was the result of a hostile German reaction, and it reaffirmed its willingness to continue this project.
The main organisation of the German industry, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I certainly do not agree with the involvement of third countries in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after the recent meeting of Chancellor Angelo Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren says seriously considering raising his candidacy during the 2020 presidential election
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, seriously discussing the question of presidential candidacy after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting in the capital city of Holjok in Massachusetts, E. Warren approved the candidate.
"The time for women to go to Washington to deal with our failed authorities, they must also go to the highest position," she said in the rotary.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential elections."
During the meeting at the town hall, Mr Warren spoke to President Donald Trump, saying that he was leading the country in an inappropriate direction.
"I am very afraid of how Donald Shortas treats our democracy," she said.
E. Warren openly criticises Dr. Trump and his proposed candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Mr Warren, in his Twitter post on Friday, said that "there is no doubt a need for an FTB study to be carried out before the vote".
However, the poll published on Thursday shows that the majority of the voters of the state itself, E. Warren, do not believe that it should not run for presidents in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Political Research Centre at the University of Safol and Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters are expected to say that the senator should not participate in the elections.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The survey showed that more support was being received by former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 percent supported his possible candidacy and 48 percent opposed.
Other discussions were held on the potential candidate for 2020: former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Mr Biden said that he would take the decision in January, as the Associated Press reported.
In the conference of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic disorder of Track Palin
At the age of 26, Track Palin, who was serving as a military officer in September, spent the year in Iraq.
On Monday night, after an incident of violence in the family, he was arrested and accused.
"I see what my son is going through when he comes back to the day, so I understand the other family that feels the effects of post-traumatic disorder, and some of the injuries of our soldiers they're returning with," she said to those gathered at the Donald Trump Summit in Tals, Oklahoma.
S. Palin called his arrest an evasive truth. She said that the sons and other war veterans “returned a little bit, they returned with a more firm heart, they returned with doubts, whether they would gain respect for what their fellow soldiers and lacunas and all the other soldiers had surrendered to their country”.
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilo, Alaska, charged with violence in the family and assault against women, as well as with charges of reporting violence in the family with a gun and being unscrupulous, as reported by Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasila Police Department for the press.
18 States and the Colombian District maintains opposition to the new asylum policy of asylum seekers
The Eighteen states and Colombian district support the legal challenge of a new US policy which refuses to grant asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday, 18 states in Washington and representatives of this district submitted comments from friends of curiae (court consultant) to support the opposition of asylum seekers' policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace v. Sessions process, which the American Civil Liberties Union has launched against federal policy, is undeclared.
She says her partner "and his gang members" raped her, but on 20 July the US officials rejected her application for asylum.
She was detained by Texas.
Lawmakers from Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the United States receives many requests for asylum, such as States, to address persistent domestic violence and violence.
The new U.S. Asylum Policy was repealed by the 2014 Decision of the Immigration Appeals Council, which allowed non-documented immigrants fleeing the violence family to apply for asylum.
In his report on Friday, the District Attorney General of Colombia, Karl Racine, stated that the new policy "is not subject to the laws of state, federal and international in force for decades".
"Federal laws require that decisions on asylum applications be taken in the light of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that this principle is infringed by such an insurance," says a friend in Curiae.
In this note, lawyers also say that the policy of banning immigrants from entering the country is detrimental to the US economy, and that immigrants will be more likely to engage in business and "provide the necessary services".
On June, Attorney General Jeff's Session instructed immigration judges to stop providing asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"It is granted to those who leave their country of residence for persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or to certain political views," said J. Sessions in a policy report of 11 June.
The aim of the asylum agreement was never to solve all the problems (not all the serious problems) people face worldwide every day.
Twice the number of victims of Palus is desperately sought out for the remaining living
The rest of the living are constantly getting worse.
"It's very stressful," says Risa Kusuma, 35 years old, while resting her son hotly in the city's evacuation centre.
"The good one does not continue to carry more and more bodies.
There's no clean water."
It has been observed that people return to their homes in ruins, collect heavy - water supplies, and try to save as much as they can.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and 7.5-ball earthquake hospitals have been depleted.
Some injured, like Dwi Haris, experienced back and heel fractures, have been placed in the field near the Palus military hospital – patients who continue to suffer from severe repeated beatings are treated in the field.
His eyes are filled with tears as he says that he felt a great earthquake in the five - room high room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save others.
I am shown to have broken through the walls of the wall," said Dr. Harris "Associated Press" and added that he and his family had come to the city to participate in weddings.
“I heard a woman’s call for help, and then I kept silent.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughters.
I hope she'll be well."
US Ambassador accuses China of promoting advertising
Last week, when the official newspaper of China published four pages of advertisements in the U.S. daily, awaiting the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald briefed China Daily on the appendage of the most affordable newspaper Des Moines Register of Iowa and accused China of affecting the elections of the United States Congress on 6 November. China denies such an accusation.
"D. Short charge that Beijing is attempting to affect the US elections marks the phase of a new strengthening Washington campaign aimed at putting pressure on China," said US officials to the Reuters Agency.
While it is common for foreign governments to spread advertising in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now entrapped into a strengthening trade war, and both countries are collecting tariffs for imports of each other.
According to Chinese and US experts, Chinese tariffs were applied to exporters of Iowa and similar countries that supported the lot of the Republics of Short.
Terry Branstadas – the US Ambassador to China, the former Governor of Iowa and one of the major exporting producers of agriculture to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
On Sunday, article T. Branstada, published in Des Moines Register, stated that China "is more concerned about printing propaganda advertisements in the press".
"In spreading the propaganda, the Chinese government used a respected freedom of speech and press in America and ordered a paid advertising report "Des Moines Register," wrote T.Branstada.
“In the meantime, you will not find each other’s votes in the local Beijing press, and you will not find a real picture reflecting different opinions that Chinese people may have about the Chinese economic trajectory, because the press is under the firm support of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
Mr Branstada also added that "one of China's most famous newspapers has withdrawn from printing" his article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: As the mid-term elections are approaching, B. Kavanaugh has failed the Republican voter
Although many Republican leaders remain loyal to the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, to whom even some allegations of sexual harassment have been made, analysts have warned that this will result in a negative response during the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The situation is very strong, and many Republicans are already officially saying that they want to vote.
Such things can't be removed later," said Professor Grant Reeheris of the University of Syracuse, at the University of Maksvelo School on Saturday.
Mr. Reeher said it was questionable whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last minute's call to launch an FTB investigation would be sufficient to discourage the bad voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will remember it both tomorrow and November," according to the Washington newspaper, on Friday, the Senior Adviser of the Progressive Group on MoveOn, and the National Representative Karine Jean-Pierre.
On Friday morning, protestors scolded: "Lapcritis is approaching!" during the demonstration, the Senate Forum, when the members of the Court Committee decided to appoint Kavanaugh, despite the evidence from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Kzip reported "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be felt across the country," said a political analyst named Stu Rothenberg for the news website.
– People say it was already strong, and they're right.
But it could further strengthen the positions, especially between undecided women's electors in the suburbs and younger voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although not in favour of the President, often simply do not vote."
Even before Mr Ford publicly giving evidence, when she detailed the allegations of sexual harassment to the candidate in the Supreme Court, the analysts said that if the Republicans approve the candidacy, this could cause a deterioration.
"The parties of the Republic have made this a big surprise," said former president of the National Committee of the Republicans Michael Steele at the beginning of last week, namely NBC News.
"We are talking not only about the committee's or final vote, not only about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed a judge, but also about how the Republicans managed this situation and how they dealt with Ch. B. Ford," said Guy's Cecil, Director of the Group of Priority USA, who helped the democratic elections.
However, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree on what to expect after the evidence from B. Kavanaugh and Ch. B. Ford, even though it is somewhat more supportive.
The new survey "YouGov" shows that 41 per cent of respondents are fully or most likely to believe in the evidence of Ch. B. Ford, while 35 per cent are fully or most likely to believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that B. Kavanaugh really or probably lied in giving evidence, and only 30 percent believe the same about Ch. B. Ford.
Mr Flake’o, FTB is currently investigating the allegations made by Mr. B. Ford and at least one other accused, Deborah’s Ramirez, has reported the evidence.
Mr Ford, who had sworn to give evidence to the Senate Court Committee last week, said that Mr. Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Mr. Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at the evening in which they attended a study at the University of Jeil.
The newsperson plans to create a new internet to oppose Google and Facebook
World Network Designer Timas Berners-Lee is creating a new startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor "Inrupt" is a company based on Bernerso-Lee's open source platform "Solid".
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as what information they have.
In an exceptional interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, the goal of Inrupt is to manage the world.
“We have to do this now,” he said about the start.
- It's a historic moment."
The Solid technology-based software enables people to create their own personal data store – POD.
It may include lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be available in one browser at the same time.
The internet store of personal data is unique to the fact that only the user decides who and to which information can be accessed.
The company refers to this as a personal authority through data.
According to Director-General John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and skills necessary to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce’s, IBM’s purchased security platform, several programmers who are convicted of working with this project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, global technology developers can develop their own decentralised programs using the tools provided on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not agree with Facebook or Google about the changes that would turn all business models up at night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In the Medium Report published on Saturday, Berners-Lee said that Inrupt "is a mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the sustainability and quality of the new Solid-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a Consortium of the Journalist at the University of Massachusetts Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Media Consortium, the Media Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I feel a great optimism about this new Internet era," Berners-Lee added.
Honored Bernard Water – Priest awarded in World War I by the Victorian Cross
The 100th anniversary of his birth in his hometown is celebrated by the only Church of England priest, awarded by the Victorian Cross as a fighter during World War I.
Lieutenant-in-chief pastor Bernard Vannas won the award on 29 September 1918.
Unfortunately, after four days the pastor shot the sniper, so he remained unaware that he had been awarded the highest level prize by the British army.
During the parade in Skashden, Northamptonshire, the stone of memory was exposed to two rings.
Michael Vannas, one of his predecessors, said that the stone was exposed 100 years ago to the reward of a profitable trade mark, was “beautiful symbolic”.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the lieutenant colonel led his battalion through the St. Kent Canal "by producing a highly refined smoke, by severely evaporating state and automatic fires."
Later he rushed to the shooting line and "especially gallantly" led the line ahead, and then one attacked the situation himself and killed three bull fighters.
The German sniper, Lieutenant Vanna, shot the colonel on 4 October 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
At 72 years of age Michael Vanna said that his old man’s actions were “like someone who will never be equal, but at the same time a very inspiring thing.”
After the parade led by Brentwood’s imperial youth orchestra, Michael and his brother, Dr. James Vanna, helped the defendant.
Michael Vannas said that he was honored to participate in the parade, and he added: “The true giant shows the support that a large number of people will give. ”
MMA astrologers didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but had to meet Kialyte Pepa
Imagine: you don't have to sleep all night to see the beautiful Bellator 206, but finally you can't see the main vision.
There were 13 fights in San Choze posters, six of them on the main card and broadcast directly in the United Kingdom all night through Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, Ggardusi and Rory MacDonald, the film "Kailytė Pepa" stopped the broadcast.
Some observers were not surprised when they said mildly, for it was because they did not sleep until the events began.
On Twitter, one patient named the change in the transmission with a children's animation film "some kind of liquefied pouch."
"In accordance with the rules laid down by the authorities, such content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., and the children's programme had to be activated," asked Bellator, chief marketing and communication vice-president Dave's Schwartz.
"Yes, "Peppa's kiss."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that in the future, efforts will be made to adjust timetables in the light of observers in the United Kingdom.
"When I think about repetition, I think we might be able to do that," Coker said.
"But then there will be 6 o'clock in the morning, Sunday, and we would not be able to resolve it until Sunday's time – on Monday's time.
However, we are already working on this.
Trust that after the transmission has changed, many messages have been exchanged, which were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the situation, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it's a government issue.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of battles to five instead of six – as we usually do. We wanted to give more to the astrologists, but just failed.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tomas Daley felt uneasy about his sexual orientation
The Olympic swimmer in the water, Tom Daley, says he grew up feeling less than others because of his sexual orientation, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
24 A sportsman only said in high school that he was not the same as everyone.
For the first time, Lauren Laverne, in the play "Radio 4" on Desert Island Discs, said he began to speak publicly about gay rights because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that after becoming a father, it was not so important to win the Olympic Games.
The permanent lead of Kirsty Young for several months has been retired from work on the disease.
In L. Laverne's first performance, which guests are asked to imagine is going to an uninhabited island, T. Daley said that growing up felt less than everyone else, because it was socially unacceptable to love both boys and girls.
He said: “To this very day, the feeling of inferiority and cynicity has been a source of encouragement to me by the forces that have helped me to succeed. ”
He said he wanted to prove that he was worth it so as not to disappoint the environment when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The winner of two Olympic bronze medals became a high-level LGBT activist, and this year he took advantage of the opportunity to invite more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he began to talk about it to the public because he believed that he had succeeded in being able to live openly without any consequences, so he would like to give others such hope.
Three times the world champion said that he was not expected to love a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance, who was introduced to him in 2013.
Mr. Daley married a 20-year-old in Oscar's high school last year, but he says the age difference never caused any problems.
According to T. Delay, when so many lives are so young – he participated in his first Olympics only 14 years after his father died of cancer – it's hard to agree something that would be the same age, but experienced the same height and lowness.
In June, the couple became the parents of Robert Ray Blacko-Daley's son, T. Daley's perspective, he said, changed completely.
“If you had asked last year, I would have said that it is most important for me to win the gold medal,” he said.
– But, you know, there are also more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robis is my Olympic gold medal."
His son's name is the same as his son Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011, when he was 40.
And T. Daley, the father didn't want to agree with death, so one of his last questions was whether to buy tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games he was going to watch in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he would no longer live so long as he could sit in the first row,” said T. Daley.
– It was more time for him to stop breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he is not invulnerable,” said T. Daley.
After a year, the athlete competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and earned bronze.
"I just knew that I had dreamed about it all my life – jumping into the water watching local audiences in the Olympic Games – there is no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the first song's selection for the song – Heather Small's "Proud", which echoed his feelings when preparing the Olympics and still pleasantly sharpening the skin.
"Desert Island Discs" is broadcast on Saturday at 11.15 a.m. in the summer of Britain.
After losing the form, Ph. mickelson passed a Saturday’s Ryder Tournament on the ground floor
The American Phil Mickelson will finish the record on Sunday, as he will participate 47 times in the Ryder Tournament, but in order not to become a failure, he will need to improve his form very much.
Ph. Mickelson, who has already played the 12th time every two years in the competitions that take place, placed Captain Jimas Furyk in the Saturday fourth match on the castle.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as was often the case in the United States, the main winner spent five times a day on the maintenance team, and the remaining part improved his technique in the field to correct fault-finding errors.
Even in the height of his career, without being hit very directly, 48 athletes are not ideal players in the pitches of Le Gold National, whose long blades of hot grass are very unpleasant to the aimless blows.
In addition, as if the platform itself weren't scary enough, in the ninth mother who's going to be on Sunday, Ph.
If the four remaining American points are able to get the next 12-unit match going well, Ph. Mickelson's mother can become absolutely determined.
Furyak expressed his confidence in his player, but he probably couldn't speak differently.
“He well understood the role he played today, hugged me through my back and shook his hand and said that he was ready to play anyway tomorrow,” Furykas said.
– He doesn't lack confidence in himself.
He is on the list of the most famous athletes both in the past and this week he gave a lot to these teams.
Maybe I didn't imagine he was playing two cats.
I imagined more, but it went like this, so we decided we'd do that.
He wants to play like everyone."
On Sunday, Ph. Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo's record and become the main athlete of the Ryder Cup.
It may be that this will mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, as well as of his personal record heights.
Ph. Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 losers and seven equals, but Fury says his presence has brought no material benefits to the team.
“He’s happy, sarcastic, conscious, he likes to laugh at people and he’s a great man with whom he’s happy to be in the team room,” he explained.
– I think that younger players were also happy to compete with him this week, it was good to look at it.
It brings much more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great deal of overpowering can happen quickly
Thomas Bjørnas, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the great overpowering approach to the last Ryder Cup matches can easily lead to a difficult fight.
The Danish athlete began in 1997 in Valderamo, where Captain Seve’s Ballesteros led the opposition team with five points to the Americans, but the finish line was crossed just as early as the result of 141:131.2.
"Let's not forget that we had a great advantage in Valderamo; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valderamo, where we just won," said T. Bjorn (in the picture), observing the victory in 2018 at 5:3 Friday and 10:6 at the Le Golf National Square.
Then the story will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow's gonna take all the power.
Go and do everything right.
Until there are no points in the board, the game is not over.
We have the goal of trying to win this prize, so we must consistently pursue it.
I always said, I trust those 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well who is in another – the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the display of his players in a difficult spot, T. Bjorn added: “I would never want to run away from my eyes in any way.
Tomorrow's gonna be a whole different hair thing.
Tomorrow will be the most important individual game – this is everything else.
It's good to play with your partner when everything's okay, but when you're in the square alone, you're testing your ability to play golf limits.
This idea needs to be introduced to players – tomorrow it will be necessary to get it all out of your mind.
Now he's going to have to be separated with his partner, and he's going to have to print everything out."
Unlike T. Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk hopes that his players will look better individually than their partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have gathered three points out of four.
Furyak himself experienced the two sides of the last day's surprise because he was on the winning team in Brussels until Europe performed the miracle of Medina and turned them into losers."
"I recall every damn word," he replied, asked as Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 to motivate his players on the last day.
– Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but seek a quick start – as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When speed occurs in one direction, the middle cats become very tense.
We have formed our team accordingly and released the players in a way that we, you know... try to create some magic tomorrow."
Mr. Thomas will have the task of trying to engage in a responsible fight and meet with Rory McIlroy's highest-level match, and Europeans will be the first to have Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jonas Rahms, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulteris.
"I have chosen these men in this order because I think they will successfully win the whole game," T. Bjorn said about their choice for the units.
New German military ship's delivery delayed again
The latest German military fleet fleet had to start work in 2014 and replace the wartime warships, but, according to the local press, they will not be seen until at least next year because of the ever-growing systems and the high prices.
According to the military representative quoted by Die Zeit, Rheinland-Pfalz, the main new Baden-Viurtemberg fleet, the delay in operation has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the military ship in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project has obscured the problems that the ship has already encountered.
Four Baden-Viurtemberg-class ships ordered by the military ship in 2007 will replace the Santant Bramen-class frigate.
It is believed that they will have a powerful condition, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft rockets and certain secretive technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Another important feature is longer periods of care, which allow the latest cargoes to travel far from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, military vessels of the latest technology, which, according to the report, should allow Germany to direct its military power to the overseas territories, will pass before they are used.
The unsuccessful F125 frigate came to the headlines last year when the German military fleet officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the buildings of the Blohm & Voss ships in Hamburg.
This is the first time a military ship returns the ship already delivered to the builder.
The reason for the return is not known, but Germany's press has limited the number of major software and technical equipment defects that would have caused the ship to trust anyone in the military mission.
The lack of software is very important because the Baden-Viurtemberg class ships will run around 120 sailors’ crew – through less force than in the older Bramen class freight.
In addition, it has been shown that this ship is too difficult – it reduces its effectiveness and limits the possibility of a military vessel to put in place various improvements in the future.
It is believed that 7 000 tonnes of Rhineland-Palatinate are twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project – including team training – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said that it rose from EUR 2.2 billion to EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion).
The latest problems of the frigate have become very important following recent warnings that the German military fleet is losing its power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the military ship is actually "in need of proper use of ships".
The officer said that over a period of time, problems had arisen because the old ships had already been written down, but there was no way to change them.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Viurtemberg class frigates could join the military fleet.
"National Trust" listens to the life of the secret schizophrenia
A new study carried out in one of the highlands of Scotland is aimed at discovering how frogs use land-based hunting food.
It is expected that the natives will provide new knowledge of the behavior of unique flying mammals and will provide some guidance for future natural protection activities.
The researchers of the National Trust for Scotland will monitor the slender pines, soprano pines, red ausyls and watery bats in the gardens of Vester Roso Inverevo.
Special recorders will be deployed in certain areas of the territory allowing for the monitoring of anti-personnel activity throughout the season.
National Health Service staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys by manual detectors.
The experts shall carry out an analysis of all sound recordings to determine the frequency and activity of any type of anti-personnel broadcast.
A map and a report of living areas will then be created to help shape the image of the detail of the behaviour across the landscape.
The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) Natural Protection Advisor Rob Dewars hopes to reveal the results that are the most important and how they are used by all kinds of people.
This information will help to identify the benefits of residential areas maintenance, such as the development of dunes, as well as how to best manage forest areas so that they are suitable for turtles and other related species.
In the last century, the stockpile population in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined.
They are threatened by building and real estate development, affecting the periphery and destroying residential areas.
There are also threats to wind power plants and lightnings, as well as mosquitoes, some chemical tools used to treat building materials, as well as hunting domestic cats.
The bastards aren't really blind.
However, grabbing a hole during the nighttime hunt helps the ears more than the eyes.
The location of the obstacles in the path of the cows or flight shall be precisely determined by means of an intelligent echo location.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, has a very responsible view of schizophrenia.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out screenings, screenings and sometimes rescue operations .
The organisation has even created the first and only reserve dedicated specifically to schizophrenics in Scotland in Damfris and in Thrave in Galve, where eight of the ten species of schizophrenics live.
David Thompson, the overseer of the court, says that the territory of the court is ideal for them.
“We have a great place in Thrave’s yard for assholes,” he said.
– We have old buildings, lots of oak trees and beautiful areas to live in.
However, we don't know much about schizophrenics yet, so work here and elsewhere will help you to understand better what they need in order to prosper."
It stresses that it is essential to check that there are no anti-personnels before the start of the territory's surveillance work, as the unexpected destruction of one outlaw may kill up to 400 women and young people, and this may lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Pesticides shall be protected and shall be prohibited from killing, harassing or disrupting them, and shall also be prohibited from destroying their feathers.
The Scottish Scythian Defence Fund official Elisabeth Ferrell urged society to contribute to the rescue of Scythian Scythians.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our dwarves, and we don’t know how many local populations are going. ”
Ch. Ronaldo rejected the charges of extortion – the lawyers intend to file a German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo called the charges he made with the use of “meliances” and said that people, using his name, “is trying to make a sound. ”
His lawyers prepared the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which printed the accusations, to be brought before the court.
The attacker of the Portuguese and Juventus clubs is accused of using the American Kathryn Mayorg in the hotel room of Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he then allegedly paid 375 000 dollars to women for this event.
Speaking to 142 million followers alive in the Instagram image a few hours after reports of accusations, Mr. Ronaldo criticized the reports for 33 years and called them "melagians".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, a liar, was spoken five times by the Ballon d’Or Laureate looking at the camera.
– By using my name, they want to smell.
It's normal.
They want to be loud, to say my name is part of my work.
I'm a happy man, all right," said the sportsman, smiling.
According to Reuters, Mr. Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to refer Der Spiegel to the court for accusations they called "unacceptable suspicions of private space.
Judge Christian Schertza said that the athlete would seek compensation for “the moral damage that would correspond to the significance of this violation – a good and one of the most serious violations of the human rights in the last few years.”
It is said that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the casino and hotel apartments in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted to the Nevada Clark District Court, Ronald and Mayorga returned to the sportsman’s room after a night club meeting, where he allegedly abused it in an analytic way.
Mr Mayorga says that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo attacked the streets and told her that he was a "99 percent good person", which was issued by the remaining "one percent" of his personality.
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that he had a sexual relationship with his spouse but claimed to have been contractual.
Mr Mayorga also said that she had contacted the police, and her injuries had been photographed in the hospital, but later she agreed not to enter into court proceedings, because "feared responsible actions" and did not mean that she would be "publicly humiliated".
A 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to withdraw the agreement because she still feels traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack, Ronaldo was a beperian from Manchester United to the Madrid Real Club, and this summer, after signing a 100 million euros value contract, he joined the Italian giant Youth.
Brexit. The United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of car manufacturers.
According to the Secretary of Business, Greg Clarke, the United Kingdom would "be forever sorry" if after Brexito, the world leader in car production lost his status.
He added with concern about the statement by the Toyota department in the United Kingdom to the BBC that, after Britain withdraws from the EU without an agreement, production in Burnaston factory near Derbio would be temporarily stopped.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer claimed that lighting at the border would lead to the loss of jobs without the agreement.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which are exported to other countries of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain suddenly left the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to stop production," said Toyota Director General Burnaston Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also expressed concern about their withdrawal from the EU without agreement and its consequences for international trade.
For example, BMW claims that after the month Brexit will close its Mini factory.
According to car manufacturers, the risks posed by the Brexit supply chain without the contract are not the most serious.
The Toyota line of production works when necessary because the details of the car manufacturers are delivered from both the UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If, on 29 March, the EU leaves the EU without a contract, there may be disturbances at the border; say the companies of this industry may therefore be delayed to provide details or to lack them.
Toyota claimed that more than one day's stocks could not be kept at the Derbyshire plant, so production would stop.
According to Clark, the future relationship with the EU's Theresa May Chequers plan is "prepared precisely to avoid such border checks".
"We need a contract: we want to have the best contract which, as I say, would allow us not only to enjoy success today but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4 programme "Today".
In addition to Toyota, the data from other car manufacturers show that it is necessary to continue to use the very successful supply chain system.
Toyota could not state what time the production would be stopped, but warned that in view of the long-term perspective, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
For 24 years, Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston factory and who is responsible for the "Unite" trade union meetings, said that his union members are increasingly concerned: "I say from experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never return."
The government representative said: "We have proposed goals and confidence in future relations with the EU plan."
According to the White House, a brief meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again
"Continuing the fight for the candidate to the Supreme Court, the meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week," the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller – the latter is investigating Russia's interference with the elections, the relations of the short supporters with Russia and the possible impediment to the justice of the President.
The question of whether short-term dismissal of the Deputy Attorney-General, thus threatening the independence of Mueller, has lasted for months in Washington.
This month's New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed recording a microphone for talks with Trump and had the opportunity to remove the president by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday while awaiting reports of his resignation.
Instead, it was announced that the meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations, would take place on Thursday.
The meeting was then held in order not to agree with the meeting of the Senate Courts Committee, where both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women accused of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Shorty FTB ordered a week to investigate Kavanaugh's allegations, and again postponed the vote at the Senate plenary meeting.
The brief representative of the press, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday in Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “Its date is not set. It may take place this week, but in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for another week.
But we'll see, I always like to tell the press."
Some journalists do not agree with this statement: since 10 September Sanders has not held any press conference in the White House.
The leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders replied that the press conferences are rarely held because they don't like TV journalists who want to see the effect. True, he added: "I have to agree with the fact that they want the effect to see the effect."
At that time, I was reminded that the Shorts were more often with the printing together directly.
"The President answers questions more often than any previous President," she said and, without giving any evidence, added: "We have reviewed this statistics."
According to Sanders, press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this and you have seen that in recent weeks this has been done many times. Press conferences will change your direct communication with the President of the United States."
A brief answer to questions will continue to be received by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with honored guests.
One person's press conferences are rare.
The President's presentation against journalists this week, free and sometimes strange, must have explained why.
Minister of Health wrote to Scottish NST workers from the EU about the concerns of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote a letter expressing his country's gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
A Scottish Parliament member sent a letter to Jeane Freeman less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the public service sector.
In a letter from Freeman, he said: “The UK and the EU's withdrawal negotiations continued this summer and are approaching the forthcoming decisions this autumn.
However, the UK Government has begun to prepare more quickly and a possible scenario without a contract.
I know you're all very upset right now.
That is why I wanted to repeat how I appreciate the contribution of all workers – no matter what their nationality.
Members from all over the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care system are useful to our patients and communities.
The school is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
An urgent operation by Christon Abercrombie
On Saturday in result 31:27 "Vanderbilt Commodores" team lost the battle head trauma experienced by the defender of "Tennessee State Tigers" to Christon Abercrombie, reported journalist "Tennesean" the organ.
"Tennessee State" senior coach Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma occurred before the break.
"He came to the side line and just slammed there," says Reed.
The trainers and doctors at the side line Abercrombie were given to breathe the oxygen, then placed on the carrier and sent for further tests.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris of Nešvili (Tenesis) told WSMV that the Abercrombie operation was completed at the Vanderbilt medical center.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type and extent of the trauma yet", while Tennessee State is trying to determine when it happened.
Abercrombie, an official sports season runner, passed from Illinois and the "Tennessee State" team played the first season.
Before leaving the matches, he recovered five balls on Saturday, and the total number of balls he recovered during the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers who purchase real estate in the UK will have to pay a higher significant tax
According to new donor plans, the UK's real estate buyers will have to pay a higher mark fee and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
This step will reduce the risk of a successful Corby campaign for young voters
The taxable persons of the United Kingdom will be taxed by the adult flag tax
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will be able to collect up to 120 million pounds a year and allocate them to help the homeless
Today Theresa May will announce that the UK is planning to tax foreign buyers who purchase real estate by means of a higher tariff tax and the additional money received to help the homeless
In order to ensure more affordable housing and to apply to high-income people, it is believed that this step will reduce the risk posed by a successful campaign for young voters to attract Jeremy Corby.
The increased tax will be taxed on the United Kingdom taxpayers and businesses and additional money will be allocated to the Government to promote the campaign against unemployment.
The additional charge – paid next to the current significant tax, including two years ago for higher rates of rent for second-hand houses or houses – may reach up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this step will raise up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built property in London is purchased by non-US residents, which makes it harder for buyers to buy the first apartment.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, so many rich countries and especially the capital regions have become city leaders.
The new strategy was presented just a few weeks ago when Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the tax and thus helped more young people to buy their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of quickly buying land, but not using it, of maintaining high real estate prices, and called on May to resolve the shame of the British housing by refusing the purchaseable home allowances.
Corbyna has published a number of proposed housing reforms involving the eyes, including the control of rental prices and the ban on discharge without guilt.
He also wants more power to build new houses for municipal councils.
“ In the coming years, ” said May, “I said that I would be able to return to the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
This means that we need to set up a troubled housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and create life.
However, it is wrong for non-UK residents and foreign-based companies to buy houses as easily as those in the UK who are working hard.
Many people's dream of having a home has become almost unreal, and the threat of humiliation is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish electorate"
The leader of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his ultimate goal is ever to become a Scottish election leader.
At the age of 42, the challenge is to restore the North-East club, currently in the third place of the first league, and the three points remaining from the first place.
Last season, after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship, he moved to Stadium of Light this summer.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I came to the B and it all ended," Ross told the BBC programme "Scotland's Sportsound".
“But in my childhood I grew up in Hamden Stadium with my father in a lot of Scottish election competitions, and this always drew me back.
True, this opportunity will only come if I manage the club successfully."
Iki Rosso "Sunderland" led Dickas Advocate, David Moyes, Sams Allardyce, Martinos O'Neillas, Royphus Keane, Guss Poets and Paul Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic, after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals, said he was not worried about starting to work for such famous leaders in such a big club.
"Now my success will be assessed by the answer to the question "Can I return this club to the Premier League?"
According to the structure and conditions, this club certainly belongs to the Premier leagues, he spoke.
"But it's not an easy task to take him down, but I'll probably just go back to the club and I'll think I'm working here successfully."
Rosso's career lasts only three years. Before that, he worked as a assistant director at the Dumbarton Club and changed the Hearts coach for 15 months.
He later helped to recover to the third division of Alloa, and the St Mirren Club, which was threatened to fall, turned the next season into the winners of the championship.
Rossa says that she is now more satisfied than ever in her career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic clubs.
"This change must have been radical," he recalls about the leadership of Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that it was better to be guided than to play.
That sounds strange because I have followed, I have earned a lot, and I have enjoyed the happy results.
But playing can be hard.
There are many problems that need to be overcome each week.
And now it's not easy – working stress and tension, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I always wanted to be a leader, and now I do it. When I grew up I always felt myself in my prayers, but leadership gives me the greatest satisfaction."

Researchers have found that the best time to drink is Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased the income of poor British bees, but even more difficult was the burden of restaurants.
The figures revealed that the sales of bee and bar groups increased by 2.7 per cent, but income in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a leading business consulting company in CGA, said: “In the long run, the British participation in the world’s championship has shown that July has continued to be similar to June, with an increase of 2.8 percent.
In June, trade in restaurants decreased 1.8 per cent, and the July situation was even worse.
The main results of the beer and bar sales were undoubtedly best, and trade in them grew stronger than in restaurants.
Although not as strong as restaurant companies, the sunflower also affected the main incomes of the food supply.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sale of drinks in well-satisfied bees and bars increased by 6.6 per cent this month and the sale of food fell by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman of the RSM’s analysis of the leisure and fertility sector states: “These results continue to be a visible trend since the end of April.
With regard to food establishments, the main factors continue to be the impact of the weather and of the most important social and sport events.
It is no wonder, then, that restaurants continue to suffer. Indeed, the fall in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly painful because it will contribute to the unrelenting cost-related pressure.
Most of the income from food-trading companies in the long summer could not come at a worse time. Time will show whether a milder August feels the temperature will provide such a necessary retreat."
The overall increase in sales in bees and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7 per cent and reflected a slowdown in the development of networks belonging to brands.
The UK industry’s monitoring tool for the bee, bar and restaurant sector and recognised by its guidelines for the sale of The Coffer Peach Tracker sector collects and analyzes operational data from 47 active groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds.
One of the five children has social media accounts hidden from parents
The study revealed that one of the five children – some just 11 years of age – has social media accounts hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20 000 high school students revealed that more would be falsified by Insta pages
The News Strengthened the Fear of the Publishing of Sexual Content
Twenty percent of students said they had to show their parents a basic account
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years of age, is a secret social media account and hides them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that a rapid increase in the number of Insta pages would be faked – this is a reference to the Instagram photo sharing website.
The News Strengthened the Fear of the Publishing of Sexual Content
Twenty percent of students claimed to use a censored main account to show their parents, but also have hidden accounts.
One mother accidentally found a hidden website of a 13 - year - old daughter and found out that the teenager was forced to offer: “User me. ”
A study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and independent School Directors' Conference (MDK) found that 40 percent of 11–18-year-old students have two accounts, and half of these students have been recognized as secretive.
M.D.K.’s leader, Mike Buchananan, said: “The fact that so many young people are willing to create virtual spaces in which parents and teachers cannot find them is a source of anxiety. ”
Elidha Doyle will vote by athletes in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidha Doyle was elected as a consultant at the General Annual Meeting of the Board of Sports Council of Scotland.
Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity that allows sports leaders to take advantage of a variety of international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidha earned great respect throughout Scotland, the UK and the world sports community, and we have no doubt that its inclusion in the Council will be of great benefit to Scotland's sport," Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I really want to serve as a sportsman’s voice and I hope that I will really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland.”
A 200-400-metre match in 1996 in the Atlantic Games and a total of four Olympic gold medals, now appearing as a permanent BBC expert, was unable to walk after the short-term ischaemic attack.
"Twitter" he wrote: "I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it would be time for me to see if I would succeed.
Work had to be done before the persecution, but I was completely healed, I learned to walk again, and I am doing mobility exercises today!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
On the Internet, breast milk advertising that compares mothers to cows received different assessments
The breast milk-producing company has gained different views on its advertising, which compares breast-feeding to breast-feeding cows.
In order to mark the beginning of trade in the product described as the first silent, portable breast-feeding in the world, the company Elvie has published an inspired advertising of the ironic music video, which aims to demonstrate the freedom that mothers provide for their mothers with new coins.
In this full cow, four real mothers dance according to the sound record in which they hear, for example, the words: "Yes, I lie to myself, but no serpents can see" and "If you haven't noticed, here are not the twins, here are my breasts."
The appendix continues: “Bring him out, and I will feed him with the young children, and he shall carry him out, and I will praise my beautiful ones. ”
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page caused an online dispute.
The viewers responded differently to the video that was reviewed 77,000 times and several hundred comments. Many claimed that it was looking through the fingers at the horrors of the dairy industry.
"It is a very poor solution to promote the use of cows for this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and born to produce milk, only after their newborns are taken from them a few days later," wrote one woman.
Elvie's breast pocket is uniquely spaced in the feeding basket ("Elvie" / "Mother")
Another commented: “It is understood that it hurts both the mother and the newborn.
But why don't they take advantage of the advertising that's giving them a breast bag for mothers whose babies aren't taken away?"
Another added: “Advertising is a complete misunderstanding. ”
Another commenter’s ad defended – one woman admitted that her song was "very fun".
"I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy it if I were still eating.
When I left the milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it as what it is.
This product is brilliant," wrote one.
Another commented: “This heavy advertising is for mothers who stop their milk (often at work or in toilets) and feel like cows.
It is not intended to consume or condemn the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that all the shocks with the boxes are undetectable.
The idea of campaigning is based on the perception that many breast - feeding women say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie coin does not emit any sound, has no wires or pipes, and has an amazing space in the feeding box – so women can move freely, keep babies or even leave the house when they leave the milk.
Mother's partner and CEO Ana Balarin commented: "Elvie's wallet is a revolutionary product, which deserves a bold and provocative start to trade it.
In comparison with milk cows, we wanted to draw attention to the withdrawal of milk and all its challenges, with the same joy and to the extent possible by showing an incredible sense of freedom that will be given by new coins.
Elvie's wallet came into the press headline not for the first time.
During the London fashion week, the designer Martos Jakubowski’s collection of two children’s mothers on the podium demonstrated using this product.
Thousands of migrant children quietly moved to a camp near the Texas border
The number of people crossing the border during the month has not changed substantially, but the children of detained migrants have increased significantly, partly because of the strict rhetoric and policies of the Short administration have made it more difficult to accommodate them with guardians.
Traditionally, the majority of guardians themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid of the possibility of staying in the country when seeking care for the child.
After the Federal Government announced in June that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would have to present fingerprints and these data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk increased.
Last week, the chief officer of the Immigration and Customs Service, Matthew Albence, testified to the Congress that the institution had detained several dozen people who had applied for adult minor care.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not previously been tried.
“Almost 80 percent of these persons – the guardians or their family members – live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore we will continue to persecute these people," said Albence.
According to shelter workers, in order to consider cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules. According to them, some children must appear in court within a month of detention rather than within 60 days as usual.
Many of the requests for legal status against an immigration judge will try to defend themselves, not on their own, but on the basis of a conference video call.
Those who do not have the right to receive aid will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and in recent months reports from the system, the longer children remain, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which may lead to forced entry or escape attempts.
Protesters say that this is even more worrying in large institutions, such as the Tornillo shelter: because of their size, there is an increase in the likelihood of not seeing signs of child getting bored.
They added that moving children to a camp town without giving sufficient time to prepare them emotionally or say good - bye to their friends can deepen the trauma that many have experienced.
Syria ordered the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In addition, when he approached the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walidas al-Mualemas invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the war has been taking place in the country for eight years.
Moualem, who is also serving as vice-president of the Minister, said that the foreign forces involved in the fight against terrorism in Syria's land are illegal and will be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said.
Moualem claimed that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to leave home, the war against terrorism is almost over.
He said that Damascus would not be able to fight this holy war until we destroy both terrorist groups and any illegal foreigners in all Syrian territories.
There are approximately 2,000 U.S. soldiers in Syria who mainly train and consult Kurdish forces and Syrian Arab President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land soldiers in a war-stricken country.
Speaking about the problem of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for returning them are good. At the same time, he accused some Western countries of spreading unjustified fear that they would turn back.
"We have come to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return," he said.
"They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will receive recovery aid only when Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
The UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey in the last major rebellion fortress in Idlibe has created conditions for faster progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a large-scale Russian-supported Syrian attack directed towards a province in which three million people live.
However, Moualems stressed that the terms provided for in the agreement were clear; he also expressed the hope that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including combatants from the Nusra front related to Al-Qaeda, which would be destroyed.
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of the Committee of Government and Opposition, which will prepare the draft Constitution for Syria and prepare for the elections.
Moualems set out the conditions under which the Syrian Government will participate in the committee: the work of the group must be limited to the review of the current constitutional articles and warned not to interfere.
Why will the short be chosen for the second term?
On the basis of such logic, in 2020, Short would be elected, unless, as many liberal observers would expect, his presidency would have been condemned and scandaled in advance.
Without a doubt, it would be the most dramatic ever since the end of the presidency!
Until now, the audience is tired of seeing signs of fatigue.
From the best broadcasting time in 2014, rankings on CNN television have increased more than twice to 1.05 million and MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million best broadcasting time viewers, with an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC The Rachel Maddow Show takes the first place in cable television rankings with even 3.5 million viewers in the main news evenings.
"It's a fire that attracts people because we don't understand something," says Nealas Baeris, producing the ABC series "Descedents" about the secretaries of the Cabinet of Ministers, which became president after the collapse of the House of Congress.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and “Only the joys and some unpleasant truths, how secret to access the Hollywood Boys Club” have another theory.
It recalls a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said I was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, "He's kidding me," said Scovell.
Chaos is worth losing.
Of course, contrary to what others show on television, the riots from Washington can determine the future of the Roe before Wade, the possibility of bringing together immigrants' families and the state of the world economy.
Ignorance is an advantage that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet more is needed than to be informed by a citizen when you realize that for six hours now you see how a group of experts are discussing how Bob Woodwards uses unpublished data to his book "Bamme", Paul Manafort is demonstrating a $15,000-dollar-priced rapid skin strike ("the great blow-up treatments", wrote "The Washington Post") and what it means is a disturbing description of Stormy Daniels Trump's anatomy.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario again.
"His actions remind you of the reality of the show, because every evening he gives you something to value", about the changing members of the Short Show and the day-to-day battle waves (insurance with the N.F.L. or honour to Kim Jong-un) says the Director-General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the founder of the Pawn Stars, Brentas Montgomery.
You can't skip any series or you'll be back.
When I contacted Fleiss this week, there were 27 degrees of heat and light sun at his home on the North Caucasus coast, but he was inside the tunnel and was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to break up – certainly not when Brett Kavanaughi had to stand before the Senate Courts Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on his hair.
"I remember when we created those stupid shows, people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought that there was something wrong here, but it turns out they were right."

The tight middle-ranking election in the House of Representatives is fighting money from the environment
It is no wonder that, due to the resolution of the congressional districts, which ended with the two members of the House of Representatives trying to win the same position, the 17th district of Pennsylvania was inundated with money.
The recently transhipped city district of Pittsberg included a Democrat from the House of Representatives Conor Lamb – last spring he won his place during his special elections in another district.
Lambas competes with another member of the House of Representatives – the Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania. Most of it prevails with a new 17th.
The maps are to be changed when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided on January that in violation of the Constitution, the old district had been falsified for the benefit of the Republicans.
In the new 17th round of elections, the financial institutions of the main parties – the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (DKK) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC) – are grouped on the financing of the campaign.
Lambas was in Pennsylvania when the 18th Congressional District won a small majority of the elections held in March.
For more than a decade, the Republicans took this place, and President Donald Shortas won 20 points in the district.
Politicians have given democrats such an advantage.
The United States tried to punish Salvador for supporting China, but then for abandonment
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, but have not largely witnessed the negative reaction of Washington.
In June 2017, Trump took part in a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and, until the partners had run the "Trump Organization", he had a hotel in this country.
"The officials of the Department of the State of Taiwan decided to withdraw the leaders of the diplomatic missions of the United States from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on recent decisions", said Heather Nauert in a previous report published this month.
However, sanctions are only considered for Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million in 2017, as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions covering the reduction of financial aid and restrictions on visas for specific persons would have been painful for the Central American country with a high level of unemployment and homicide.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year, which was considered an important step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear their wish for the conference to take place and thus essentially ended any discussion on sanctions for Salvador.
"In order to show the importance of this meeting by the administration, the list of speakers of the conference scheduled to be held in mid-October is included by Vice-President Mike-Pence," the diplomats said.
And three United States envoys quietly returned to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without reporting any abuses or punishments of Washington.
The representative of the White House refused to comment on the details of the discussion that three American officials, including two diplomats, shared with Bolton. They agreed to discuss internal discussions only if their anonymity is preserved.
Their statements shall be confirmed by an analytic close to the administration, also spoken if its anonymity is preserved.

The Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstacle to justice in the short term can now be expected to be inevitable: his very strong evidence is now available in the public archives.

"How will we react if the new FTB is conducted by Bretto Kavanaugh's investigation proves to be incomplete or incorrect, or if this candidate will be appointed to the Supreme Court, despite the convictions and false evidence?
And, finally, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress, which will force the Short to assume responsibility?
If we don't hold on to these tests, democracy is threatening for a long winter.

Graham Dorrans from the "Rangers" meeting with Rapid Vienna awaits optimistically
On Thursday, "Rangers" Rapid Vienna will accept knowing that if after this month in Spain, the impressive competition with "Villarreal" against the east could be won, it would be in a strong position to leave the G group.
Due to the middle of the road trauma player Graham Dorrans this season could only appear for the first time in the 2:2 final match with Villarreal. But he hopes that the Rangers Club can use this result as a tramp for more important goals.
"We had a good result because "Villarreal" is a great team," said the 31-year-old player.
“We started playing with the hope that we would achieve something, and we ended this.
At the end of the day, we might have been able to be more peaceful, but in general, the competition was not bad.
They were probably better at playing the first floor, and we sat in the second and showed who we were better team.
There will be another important European league evening on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points. The game will be difficult because in the last game their result was great. But I am sure with the support of the spectators we can push forward and achieve a good result.
Last year it was really hard – and what happened to my traumas and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the boys are really happy; training is great.
I hope that we will now be able to move forward, forget the past season and play successfully."
The fear of this pension savings makes a woman feel insanity
Even though the interviewers had a clear idea of what kind of care they would like to take, they had little discussion with family members.
About half of the respondents in the Nationalwide study said that they were talking to their spouses about the long-term care price.
Only 10 percent said you were talking to your children about it.
"People want them to be cared for by family members, but they are not trying to talk about it," said the Vice-President of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company Holly Snyder.
Here's what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you don’t report your wishes in advance, your families will not be prepared to take care of you.
Talk to the consultant and the family about where and what supervision you would like to receive, as these factors may be important in order to anticipate the costs.
Call the financial advisor. The consultant can also help to figure out how to pay for these expenses.
You may decide to pay these expenses by means of a traditional long-term care insurance certificate, mixed with a life-value insurance certificate or by insurance your assets until you have money.
Select legal documents. Prevent legal disputes by protecting legal documents.
Choose a health care authority. Choose a reliable person who will take care of your medical care and ensure that your wishes will be met by specialists if you are unable to communicate.
Think, too, of the power to take care of your finances.
You should choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that the accounts are paid if you become ineffective.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
"At least 384 died when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the city of Palu on Friday," officials say.
As a result of the destruction of the communication services, officials were unable to obtain any data from the Dongal Regent, in the north of the Palus area near the 7,5-point earthquake epicenter.
In case of disaster, more than 16,000 people are evacuated from Palu.
Here are some of the most important facts about Paul and Dongal on the island of Slaves.
In 2017, about 379 800 inhabitants held Palu are the capital of the central province of Slavesio, which is located at the end of the valley on the west coast of the island of Slavesio.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regent, located near the coast more than 300 km (180 miles) north of the island of Slaves.
In Regentia, around 299 200 people lived outside the province in the smaller administrative region in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Province of Slovene, in particular in the coastal region of Dongal.
It is also important in the province that nickel mining is mainly concentrated on the other side of the Sulawesian coast in Moravola.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Palu and Dongala suffered several times over the last century from tsunamis.
In 1938, tsunamis in Dongal killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, in 1996 the Danube tsunami struck and killed nine people.
On a seismicly active Pacific fire ring, Indonesia is constantly rocking the ground.
Here are some of the most important developments in recent years with earthquakes and tsunamis.
On 26 December 2004, a severe tremor on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
At the end of March and early April 2005, several strong tremors hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Near the island of Nias, hundreds of people were killed.
In 2006, the earthquake of 6.8 bullets hit the southernmost populated part of the island of Java in Indonesia and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
In 2009, the shock of 7.6 points hit the area near the capital of the western province of Sumatra, Pango.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
In 2010, the shock of the 7.5-point force hit one of the nearby Isles of Mentawaya in the summer and caused a tsunami with up to 10 meters of waves, washed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
In 2016, Pisije Jaja’s regentia was killed and panicked because people remembered how everything was torn apart after the terrible shaking and tsunami of 2004.
This time, the tsunami did not exist, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
In 2018, strong tremors struck the island of Lombok, which was visited by tourists from Indonesia, and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily landed on the coast.
Major son of Sarah Palin detained for charges of domestic violence
As a result of the accusations, Track Palin, the son of the former governor of Alaska and the candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested.
The report published on Saturday by the Alaska Police states that 29-year-old Palinas from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested for suspected family violence, for preventing reports of family violence and for detention.
As stated in the police report, when a known attempt was made to call the police to report suspected crimes, he took the phone off.
As reported by the KTUU, Palinas returned to the pre-trial detention facility in Mat-Su and was released for $500 security.
"Today he appeared in court where he was asked to justify himself as completely innocent," the network reported.
Palina is accused of three Class A offences, which means that she may be sentenced to a fine of $250,000 a year.
He's also charged with Class B violation, prison day and $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin's criminal charges have been filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palino.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspected attack.
The case is currently being considered by the Aliask Veterans Court.
This event is linked to the accusations made by the attack at home in January 2016, the failure to report on the crime of domestic violence and the maintenance of the weapon in a state of emergency.
His girlfriend said he'd hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin became critical of the veteran groups when her son’s harsh behavior was linked to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: Hundreds of people have died
At least 384 people died after Friday at the tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.
A 7.5 - foot - high earthquake caused tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working. The number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place near the central Slovene, north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The social media shares video footage showing the moment of the tsunami.
The tsunami hit the coast when hundreds of people were gathered to the beach in the city of Palus.
Federal Prosecutors seek rare death sentences for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking death sentences for Sayfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people. This is a rare penalty that has not been committed in this country for federal crimes since 1953.
It is suspected that on October 31st Saipova, 30 years from Home Depot, launched an attack on the bikes so near the western highway in underground Manhattan, while he was on his way to peace, he loaded pedestrians and bikers.
As stated in the South New York County report on the intention to seek a death penalty, prosecutors who have been sentenced will have to prove that Saipova deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these defendants may be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged by the Federal Supreme Court with 22 counts of crimes involving the killing of eight counts relating to the use of property (usually in cases of organised crime by federal prosecutors) and the killing of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors say that the attack was well planned and preconceived, and that what Saipova did called it was a fraud, atrocious and immoral.
"Because of the actions of Sayfull Habibullaevicio Saipov, members and friends of the following families were injured, injured and loved: Diego Enrique Angelio, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darreno Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernano Ferruchio, Hernano Diego Mendozo and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucco", – the report on intentions.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case in which the death penalty was imposed was considered in the South New York District ten years ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but finally he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in 1953 in the federal case of New York for Julius and Ethela Rosenberg, when they were sentenced two years ago to snowflake the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenberg were sentenced to death on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipova, who came from Uzbekistan, did not feel sorry for his conduct either immediately after the attack or several months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipova revealed to officials that he was inspired by the videos of the Islamic State (ISIS) that he was watching on his phone.
The police reported that they had also requested that the flag of the Islamic State be hung in the hospital chamber.
He did not acknowledge his guilt in accordance with the 22 defendants.
David Patton, one of the defenders of the federal state funded Saipov, said that they were clearly disappointed by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to pursue the death penalty, not to acknowledge the guilt and to punish the living head without being able to be released, will only prolong the trauma of these events to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to be sentenced to death.
Their MP says that Brexit must be responsible for the negotiations with NIGELAS FARAGE
Today, in a protest at that conference, Nigel Faragea promised to mobilize the nation's army.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must feel the heat of Eurosceptics, and one of Theresa May's parliamentarians suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Member of the Community Chamber of Conservatories Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have already resigned if Brexit had been Farage.
But the difficulties that May is facing in trying to unite the defeated supporters alongside him have revealed to the parties who are talking about the stay of the EU, who have joined the city's separate protest against Brexit.
It is difficult for the Prime Minister to implement a compromise plan agreed in the Czech Republic when it is attacked by Brexit's supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Union urged that it seek to reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of its adverse reactions and force Eurosceptics and the Liberian Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bone, during the "Leave Means Leave" meeting, told Solihale that he wanted to break the Chekers plan.
He claimed that Farage should have been an equivalent partner and that he should have been given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he were a leader, we would have already left the EU," he said.
He added, "I fight for Brexit," but we must reject the Chekers plan."
Expressing its opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in World Wars because we were obedient to others.
We want to adopt our laws in our country."
"Bone" has denied the notice that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
Brexit's columnist Andrea Jenkins also participated in the demonstrations and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Minister President, listen to people.
The Chekers' plan is not popular among the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it, and it is not popular among our party members and activists who go to the streets and, most importantly, vote for us.
Give up the Chekers plan and start listening."
In a critical report, May added: “The Prime Minister keeps his posts when he keeps his promises.”
Farage said that nutrition policymakers must be forced to feel hot if they issue a decision adopted by the referendum in 2016.
"This is now the issue of trust in our people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to issue Brexit, so today we're here to tell them that we won't let them get away with it."
Turning to the enthusiastic minority, he added: "I want you to force our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, to feel hot.
We are mobilizing this nation's army, which has brought us the victory of Brexit, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud in the United Kingdom."
And Brexit's opponents, before they set up a two-hour rally in the city centre, walked through the streets of Birmingham.
After this weekend's group was set up, the club was active in my own posters "Torias v. Brexit".
Leborist Lord Adonis seized the conservator about the security problems they experienced as a result of the party program at the beginning of the conference.
"These people who say they can install IT systems and all the technologies needed for the Canadian plus option, borders without borders and free trade without borders with Ireland," he said.
"This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take a serious look at the Presidential elections
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections she would seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential elections.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat was talking about his future in a meeting with society, on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who constantly criticises President Donald Trump, participates in the November re-elections in which he will meet GOP’s representative, Geoffu Diehlu, one of the leaders of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was announced that it could meet with Trump in 2020.
Since Short became president, the Saturday afternoon event in Holjoke was its 36th meeting with voters using the public meeting format with the public.
One participant asked whether she was planning to participate in the presidential elections.
Warren replied that the time had come for women to go to Washington and set up a sovereign government, and for this to be run by women.
Suspected in the LSU Sims killing case
The Baton Ruže police in Louisiana reported on Saturday that they had detained the suspect accused on Friday after killing LSU's basketball player in Wayde Sims.
At a press conference held at 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department reported that 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson had been detained.
The police distributed the video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify the man who was seen in it.
Twenty - year - old Sims was shot and died near the city of South University on Friday.
According to "247sports", police chief Murphy J. Paul announced on Saturday that Wayne Sims had been shot in the head and died of injuries.
Wayde was standing to defend a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the crime scene, had a gun and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained and was arrested by the police department of the Eastern Baton Rouge.
198 cm of the last high course student, Simsa grew up in Baton Rose, played 32 games last season, 10 of which started in the fifth, on average spent 17.4 minutes in the field, earned 5.6 points and recovered after 2.9 balls.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the world championship title when the team ordered him to give the victory to Sebastian Vetteli
When Walter Bottas won Lewis Hamilton on a qualifying ride on Saturday, he immediately made it clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team in the race would be very important.
The race began in the first place, and Bottas was finely launched and, defending his position in the first two stages, was just not left in Hamilton’s trouble, encouraging Vettel to attack his team’s friend.
The first one went to the two-door garage, left Hamilton, and went to the races in the backyard of the group, so it was decisive.
Mercedes went to the two-hole garage after the wheel and returned to the track for Vetteli, but Hamilton, after having just finished contact, pushed forward when the Ferrari driver after a double manoeuvre, in order to maintain his position in the third direction, reluctantly released the internal side of the track.
On the 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started at the end of the retreat, but at the end of the first round, he was already on the seventh.
It was the fastest part of the race because it was going without changing tyres to make it as fast as possible to wrap Kimi Raikkonen and finish the fourth.
At the end of 44, he turned into a two-hole garage, but in the remaining eight wheels he was unable to increase the pace and Raikkonen was the fourth of the finish line.
“It was a difficult day for Walter because he had been doing well all weekend, and when I was asked to spend, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team worked well and found the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was a really simple body language
President Donald briefed Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday's meeting with the people because he refused to follow up on Christine Blasey Ford's letter, in which a candidate for the Supreme Court's Judge Brett Kavanaugh was charged with sexual abuse.
Speaking in the West Virginia language, the President did not directly mention the evidence Ford provided to the Senate's Legal Committee, but said that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are rude, unfair and unfair.
"What could have happened and actually happens in the last days in the Senate when you see anger when you see people being angry, rude, unfair and unfair," he said.
“When you see official statements and executions, and then you say: ‘ Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, are you all gone?
Do you remember her answer to the question, did the document come out?
Not really.
I'm not gone."
Well, wait a minute.
If we died... no, we didn't die," he added, representing the senator.
Another July Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's accusations to Kavanaugh and which was executed earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been executed from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein said to the Committee: "I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations and her stories didn't disappear."
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked."
However, the president apparently did not agree with her negative attitude, for he said on Saturday evening when he met people: “You know, this was a really bad language.
It may not have happened, but it was the worst language I've ever seen in my body."
Further defending the candidate to the Supreme Court's judges, whom three women were accused of unlawful sexual behaviour, the president said that the democrats had used the accusations for their own benefit.
"They have chosen to restore power by any necessary means.
You see wickedness, insubordination; they don't care about what they're saving or what they're going to have to move to get power and control," another president's language "Mediaite".
Elite league: “Dundee Stars” 5:3 “Belfast Giants”
Patrick Dwyers won two matches at Dandi club "Giantas"
The Dundee Stars returned for the defeat of Belfast’s “Giantas” in the Elite League on Friday and won the Saturday’s responsible match Dandi at 5:3.
"Giantas" was put forward in advance when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier won two awards.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie was a remarkable result before Dwyer again taking Giants forward.
Francois Bouchard of the Dandi team compared the result, but later two Lucas Lundwald Nielsen teams won the victory.
Adam Keefe’s men experienced the third loss of this season in the elite league, before that Friday night in Belfast, pulling and winning Dandi Club as a result of 2:1.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, the last three cats won the Giants.
In the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendall McFaull's transfer, the door was closed, and after four more minutes, the Beauvilier doubled after David Rutherford's transfer.
In the hard-started games, Sullivan returned the owner of the arena to the game by winning the 13:10 game, and after Matt Marquard's transfer, Cownie compared the result 15:16.
The door made sure that Giants went out for the first break, and at the end of the first climb he earned his second evening meal.
Having a quantitative surplus, the square owners regrouped and Bouchard once again compared the result 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen for the first time in the Dandi team to push forward at the end of the second round, and secured victory by winning the fifth round in the middle of the last round.
"Giantas", who has already lost four last five games, will meet the Milton Keynes team next Friday at home.
The pilot was killed to help hundreds of passengers escape the earthquake
The Indonesian pilot was announced by a giant when he was killed by several hundred passengers flying safely into the air.
More than 800 people were killed, and many are considered to be the dead after Friday the earthquake of a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Slaves.
The village continues to suffer severe repeated underground blows and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city.
Although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the highly fluctuating control booth in the city of Mutiaros Sis Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed at his place of work to help 6321 fly to the Batik Air plane, which was already on such an elevator at the time, safely to rise.
Then, when he thought the flight control tower was crashing, he jumped out of it.
He later died in the hospital.
According to Australia's ABC News, Indonesia's Air Navigation Representative Yohannes Sirat said his decision could save hundreds of lives.
We had him thrown into a bigger hospital in another city by a helicopter from Kalimantan.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, but we haven't met Paul yet.
"This is an endless message for us," he added.
And the government is afraid that the number of deaths may rise to thousands, because the country's disaster reduction agency reports that the cities of heaven, Sigio and Boutongo are difficult to reach.
"The number of victims is expected to increase, as many victims are still behind bars and cannot be reached," said Sotopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's representative.
The city of Palus, which is about six feet high, was broken down, and was laid up in the midst of the upper court on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Thirty-five-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma Sky News, said: "Every minute fast cars come to the victims.
There's no clean water.
Self-catering shops are all over the place .
Janis Gelfanda, director of the International Red Cross of Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
It is already a tragedy, but the situation can get worse."
On Sunday, Indonesian President Jokas Widoda arrived in Pala and approached the country’s army: “I am writing all of you to work day and night in order to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" Reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says that one man has fallen into a plane
The flight that ended the plane crash in the Pacific Ocean basin of Micronesia, now underway, says that one person is poor, although it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members were rescued from the fighting aircraft.
In the report, Air Niugini said that on Saturday afternoon they had no knowledge of one passenger man.
The airlines indicated that they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and researchers in their search.
The airlines did not respond immediately to requests for further information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local boats helped rescue the other passengers and the crew when an aircraft tried to land at the airport of Chuk Island fell into the water.
On Friday, the officers reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airlines said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, all of them stable.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what was the exact outcome of the incident.
The U.S. Airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft had landed in the deck without landing such a landing.
Some Witnesses believe that the plane did not apply for a landing.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from a very low ground.
"It was very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told me that we were fighting and on a plane that was blown up before him and others were able to crash before the crash.
He said that the pilots were panicking and shouting, and he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that after repairing the nearby trailer, their mariners also helped to save people who were being boarded by a boat on the coast before the plane hit a depth of about 20 feet [30 m].
According to aviation safety network data, over the last two decades Papua New Guinea has killed 111 people in aircraft accidents registered in New Guinea, but none belonged to Air Niugini.
Analytical statement of the night when the woman was burned alive, the sequence of events
The prosecutor’s office set out the facts available in the case of a man who was guilty of reincarnating a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the mobile phone records to connect the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and Nineteen-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movement on the night of death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowletts said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Telllis was with Chamber on the evening of her death, which is contrary to previous statements.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to check on Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and testified that he had not been in his city that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth, saying that he was on Sandford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “dealing because his truck was in Nashvili.”
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records show that they met each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after some time after Chambers died, Tellis had removed Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," said Hale.
It is expected that the defence of its final arguments will start on Sunday.
The judge told me that the case would be handed over to the jury later that same day.
"The High Breed": what is a conscious hippopus?

They want to go back to hippop sources and repopulate the conscious hippop.
Such performers as The Fugees and Commons recently re-born the UK of performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
One more black?
The New York branch filed a sentence after being dismissed from work on a "racist" message
The New York branch gave the court a couple for dismissal from work because of discrimination after receiving a message sent to the wrong address from the mother who complained that she was "one more black".
The couple is negative to the existing racists and the claim is called "consuming".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, was excited to learn that the new guardian Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on the first working day of 2016.
‘NOEEEEEE, BUT ONE JUDGMENT’ – Mr Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in the message.
However, she was sent twice not to her husband, but to Mr. Maurice.
On the basis of the New York Post, the unscrupulous Plasco-Faxman felt uncomfortable and fired from work Mr. Maurice, saying that the former cousin, who was an African-American, had done his job badly and hoped to be a Filipino instead.
Mr. Maurice was paid for one working day and was sent home by Uber's car.
Maurice has now put a couple in court requesting compensation for dismissal and seeks to pay even after 350 USD per day for half a year's life and work at the client's home, for which she was initially hired even without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things can't be done," she said on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination".
The couple withdrew from the accusations of racism by denying it and claiming that Maurice's dismissal was reasonable because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after she was injured.
“My wife sent her what she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said the man Joel Plascas.
“Would you trust your children to be someone you were unmanaged, even though that was a mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
According to Plascas, “consuming” claims that the wife was pregnant just two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation”.
Are you going to judge for that?
This is not very nice behaviour," added an investment banking specialist.
While the trial was under trial, the media was eager to condemn a couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers are afraid that readers will not understand the speaker’s words.
The daughter of Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel somewhere else that she’s reading the book for the first time before she was released.
Now it's very interesting to know what we know about the enormous success of Paddington."
By saying that her father, who was working with the BBC operator before finding inspiration to write a book on puppies, wouldn't be too excited if his work had been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of his father's death was pleasant and sad.
Speaking of Padington, which she describes as "a very important family member", she added that her father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and didn't like drinking," she said.
“When Padington was like himself, he felt as if he had a child who had achieved something: be proud of him, though it is not your job.
I think he had a similar appreciation for the success story of Paddington.
Although it was his creation and the fruits of his imagination, he was always the one who earned his own Paddington.
My daughter was confused and I had to say goodbye on the phone with her.
After her daughter was released, she was quickly taken to the 2nd hospital in Nicos Louis Pasteur, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"Nada kept calling and said that the situation was really bad, it is not expected to survive," said Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I received a call from Nado, who called to say that she had to live two minutes and had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I told her: “Tashi, dear, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription, which has been administered slowly and has been removed from the body.
She died a little while earlier, and that was the end of it all.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't fight, fight or cry because I was in the environment, surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it to myself."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperous, now to disgrace his dead daughter, entered the plane along with other passengers who did not realize what difficult test she had to face.
"Nothing knew," she said.
"My head was thrown away and tears were shed all the time.
It was hard to explain why, but it was in the plane that I felt a great deal of compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's opens are designed to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones in death try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Vels Bridge spread open with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and ask for help.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he was depressed and killed when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want one parent to feel like I have to feel every day," she said.
A 45 - year - old man in Lidny said that her son was a very promising boss who would spread a sinful smile.
"Everyone knew him about his smile.
They always said his smile would light up the room."
However, he did the work before he died because he was “in the very dark. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother killed.
Mr Davis said, "I was afraid that a chain reaction could occur."
“ That people know that there are people around us who can be approached and talked to, even if they are friends.
Don't sit still, you have to talk."
Mr. Humphrey, longtime friend of Mr. Davies, died of his 15-year-old partner, Mark, who left his life shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he felt depressed, overwhelmed by depression and did not complain," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed his changed attitude.
During Christmas the situation was completely bad: when the children gave their gift, he did not look into their eyes and did not react."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they had to overcome it: “This left a void in the family.
It's tearing our hearts.
But we all have to live on and fight."

After FTB started the study, the future of Bretto Kavanaugh was packed on the hair
I think that if we could actually get something he asked for – a study of limited duration and scope – maybe some unity," said Mr Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would be "bye" in the tougher groups of supporters.
Why did the sponsors of Mr Kavanaugh and his Republicans not want the FTB to start the investigation?
Their opposition is only a matter of time.
Until the mid-term elections to be held on 6 November, only five weeks remained and if Republicans appear poorly, their efforts to elect people to the highest court of the country will be very weak.
George W. Bush called the senators in order to convince them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and met his wife Ashley, former Personal Secretary, Mr. Bush.
What will happen when the FTB submits its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh Senate can obtain 50 votes to allow Vice-President Mike Pence to withdraw his contact and approve him to the Supreme Court.
After Kim came to power, the number of deserters in North Korea was "reduced"
The publisher of the laws of South Korea said that the number of North Korean deserters to South Korea decreased when Kim Jong-uns came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-sewage, quoting data from the South Korean Union Ministry, said that 1,127 deserters were identified last year compared to 2,706 deserters in 2011.
Mr Park said that the main factors were reinforced control of the North Korean and Chinese border and increased human smuggling prices.
Pchenjan did not comment in public.
Many North Korean deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border.
Many fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China regards deserters as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often pushes them back to their parents.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still technically fighting, has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in the Pchenjane negotiations, which had been held in the centre of the nuclear-weapon-free negotiations.
This took place after the historic meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when both agreed to achieve that the Korean peninsula would become a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
However, on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not changing its sanctions since that time.
"If there is no US trust, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm," said Mr. Ri, speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Brett Kavanaugh concludes by saying that he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, candidate for the Supreme Court Judge, called Brett Kavanaugh "sister" and said that he did not deserve to serve the Supreme Court for his temperament.
Mr. Pelosi made these comments during an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival.
"I simply cannot think that if a woman did so, she would be said to be a woman," – Mr Pelosi said in his reaction to Mr Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Court Committee on Thursday.
B. Kavanaugh was emotionally opposed to charges of sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom were teenagers.
In his introductory speech when he spoke about the family and the times of high school, B. Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes uninvited.
He also completely condemned the former Democrats in the committee, who made accusations against him by calling him a "grossful and coordinated destruction of reputation", which was not organised by the Liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost his presidential election in 2016.
Pelli claimed that the evidence provided by Mr Kavanaugh had shown that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he had revealed his bias towards the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself by his statements and by the attack by the Clinton and the Democratic Party," she said.
It was asked whether it would be possible to remove Mr Kavanaugh if his candidacy were approved and the majority of the votes taken in the House of Representatives, Mr Pelosi objected.
“I will say so – if he is lying to Congress or the FTB, it is not appropriate to go on duty not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,” said N. Pelosi.
At present, Mr Kavanaugh is the judge of the District Court of Appeal of Colombia.
Mr Pelosi added that she was concerned about the possible decisions by Mr Kavanaugh as a Democrat on the accessible health law or in the Roe v Wade case, because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the approval meetings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time that we would say to the most intimately, side by side, after the judge: "How wonderful!" said Mr Pelosi.
The potential for which women should use
This is a legitimate criticism of the fact that it has finally been released for months and even for a year, an influx which it cannot express without tears.
"When we get lost, we cry," after 45 years I was told by the Steinem Panel.
"I don't think it's an unusual thing to do with you?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by one woman, a manager of a company, who said that she was crying when she was asleep, but she developed a certain method: she was worried and started to cry, and she said to the man she was talking to at the time: ‘ You may feel like I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm really angry."
And she was just crying next.
I thought it was a genius."
The expression of anger is considered acceptable in part because it is essentially misunderstood.
One of my greatest memories is of one of the first works in which men worked mostly and where I began to cry for unexplained anger. Then I was caught by the older woman, the manager, who was always a little scared, and he pushed me into the closet.
"Never let them see you crying," he told me.
- They don't know you're in.
They think you're crazy, so you'll be happy to beat you."
A Democratic Party Congressman from Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Harts was caught on a foreign voyage on the "Monkey Business" (aforism, which means freely allowed time) and withdrawn his candidacy, deeply disappointed Mr. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why he could not apply to the president himself.
“This was not a well-founded solution,” he said after 30 years.
– There were seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for one more.
Someone called me "Snow with seven beads."
Later, after the campaign was launched, there was little time left for the funds to be collected, so she vowed not to announce the candidacy until she would earn $2 million.
It was an unparalleled fight.
She noted that some of the sponsors who gave $1,000 to the men were assigned only 250 to her.
“Did they think I was getting discounts?” she said.
In saying the language in which it was announced that it was starting a formal campaign, it was so filled with emotions – people who were grateful for it, a system of disappointment which made it very difficult to raise funds and directly reach voters, not representatives, and anger over sexism, that it said.
“You should remember that I was nervous,” recalled Mr Schroeder’s reaction to the press.
– You'd think I'd be supported by the Kleenex waiter business.
I remember thinking about what's going to be written in my grave.

How the U.S. and Chinese Trade Generation can be useful to Beijing
The U.S. and China's war of trade was created, and although the battle has not yet ended well, according to experts, the lack of agreement can become of lasting benefit to Beijing.
The US President, Donald Shortas, gave the first warning this year of the earlier taxing of the main products exported from China, including solar elements, steel and aluminium.
The clearest contradiction occurred this week, when new tariffs were in force, affecting goods worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion dollars), i.e. half of the goods exported to the United States will be taxed.
The Beijing response to all the measures was the same: the most recent decision is based on a customs duty of between five and ten per cent for American goods with a total value of $60 billion.
China has sworn to fight US teeth for teeth, and it seems that this second world market by size is not really going to be released in the near future.
Washington's sanctions would only be mitigated if China complied with the requirements, but the US would be too narrow for China's President Xi Jinpingui.
However, experts say that if Beijing has properly defeated its party, the difficulties of trade with the United States can have a long-term positive impact on China because it will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
"The sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions under which the economy of both countries would move is really much more dangerous than observers have so far recognised," said Abigail Grace, an employee of the Institute of Science at the Asia New Security Centre.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready to accept return refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for voluntary refugee return and asks for assistance in restoring the country that was killed in the war for more than 7 years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Validas al-Mualemas said conditions in the country are improving.
"As a result of progress in combating terrorism, the situation in the territory has become much more stable and safer," he said.
The government is continuing its efforts to restore the damaged areas of the terrorists and restore the normal situation.
All conditions have already been laid down for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave due to terrorist and unilateral economic sanctions directed against daily life and prosperity.
Since the beginning of the war, the United Nations has left Syria some 5.5 million.
There is a need for humanitarian aid for six million people living in the country.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in the reconstruction of the deceased country.
However, it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from the countries supporting the rise.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team, which won the U.S. final match 16,5:10,5, won the Ryder Cup in 2018 at Le Golf National Square near Paris (France).
The United States has lost six times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in this country since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team gathered 14.5 points enough to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star Phila Mickelson, who was hard to follow during the entire tournament, launched a hit from the starting point directly into the water on the 16th day of the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian player F. Molinari appeared in all rounds and became one of the four players who achieved the result 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament gained the current form.
U.S. Jordan Spieth 5:4 won the lowest ranking European team player Thorbjorna Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson 2:1, who holds the highest ranking in the world, lost the English to Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder tournament.
The eight ryder tournament veterans from Spain, Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European player of the tournament at all times, gathering a 25.5 career point.
“I rarely say, but I cannot manage today.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Mr Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I am very happy, very happy that we have returned the cup.
Everything depends on the team, and I am glad that I was able to help," said Mr Garcia after the European victory.
He transmits the tape to his father John Ramu, who in the Sunday unit game 2:1 has inspired the US Gulf legend Tiger Woods.
"I'm incredibly proud of winning Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play," said 23 years old Rahmas.
Woods lost all four of his cats in France and now belongs to him 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
This is a surprising statistics for one of the best players of all time who won the 14 biggest prizes and sent only to Jack Nickles.
The U.S. team failed all weekend to access the drive deck, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high-level game during the entire tournament.
“ I’m proud of these men, they fight, ” said Captain Jim Furyk, after the depressing team.
This morning was a moment when we started printing Europeans.
We're on our way.
I'm taking my hat off Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Council Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
It's got to slow your head down.
Our opponents were more proficient."
