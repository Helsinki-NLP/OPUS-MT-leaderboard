In an emergency call, the professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend
During an emergency call with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to the police that he shot his girlfriend and it's necessary for them to come home.
Lamb predicted that his "sweet dog" was home alive and probably upset, and that contacts for the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten message on the white office paper: "I'm so sorry and wish I could get it back, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," wrote a letter signed by Lamb by the authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to the school campus where the police think he shot his favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at his office.
Police chief at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 this morning.
Lamb must have made a fateful phone call on the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came to him.
The day after the school was shot, students and faculty were forced to hide behind closed doors, and the authorities in charge are still trying to see what Lamb's motivation was.
Details published by investigators on the state side and students and employees who knew him together created a picture of a talented but probably problematic teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no record of the criminal record or of a violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, thanking "great people", with which he shared his academic life.
Both were taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, along with 17 other members of the Faculty, and many students attended classes at both at once.
At the same time, there has been an incendiary with regard to problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed agitated and upset, "as if there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him that he was suffering from stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had already asked Delta State University for freedom for health reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes regarding the recruitment of university employees meant that the doctorate, on which Lamb worked hard, would not guarantee him an automatic functional period in order to become an assistant professor.
The president of William LaForge University said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb probably suffered something."
Lamb won't answer these questions anymore.
After he left campus, the police caught his foot when he crossed the Arkansas state border back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with the only gun shot in the yard about a mile from his parents in Greenville suburb of Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of the state of Washington, Methel Johnson.
The car's left on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb started working at a university that has 3500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 and taught the geography and the hours of education.
He got a doctorate at school in spring.
One of Lamb's long friends described him as a wise, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met with mutual friends.
She was with her friends at high school, and he was the great older boy who taught her guitar for several years.
It was quite a pain in the heart at the time.
The hearts of all the girls disappeared as soon as he showed up," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss were supposed to be walking for a while.
During the emergency call Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house next to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was okay.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," said O'Steen about her daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
He said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he knew Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and Abigail were performing at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
"Steen said his daughter wrote and sang her own music.
Prettiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, barman and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a rather lighted bar near Gautier, said that he last saw Lamba and Prentiss on the night of September 5, the pot that Lamb played on the guitar and harmony for countless dabs.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We lied and played each other for jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a professor killed, conducted a first year seminar and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the Boy Student Club and the Student Government.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, employees, students and members of the community, took part in the commemoration with candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and Brother Jeff Schnitt also took part in the watch during which the university congregation sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Authors for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was adjusted to reflect the fact that the police are now claiming that Lamb made a call on the emergency line after Schmidt was killed, and that even though Lamb called his wife Prentiss, there is no evidence that they were really seductive.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us declare that they do not recruit as many seasonal workers as last year, but the producer of toys and products claims that it gives current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work out more hours.
The company also stated that it is planning to hire around 40,000 employees at trades and distribution centres across the country, which is down against 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start with a set of applicants this month, and the employee will pick up during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is near and companies are preparing to receive temporary assistance in trades and sales, for the dispatch and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'range' with Princess Diana
The premiere "Back to the Future" was a great professional moment for Michael J. Foxe.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I found that Princess Diana was going to sit there," said in the trailer for the coming document, "Back in time."
The film begins and happens to me that I'm on something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in Time," is a document on "Return to the Future," which introduces talks with Fox, Leo Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere "Back to the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really the most controversial travel document I've ever seen."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected movies in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of almost five years of conflict and more weapons only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN Chief of Staff urged all parties, including the UN Security Council, once again to join and support the inclusive political solution negotiations.
Ban said at the mid-term press conference that he plans to meet with foreign ministers five permanent councils of the countries - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the end of the Ministerial Meeting at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He said policing about the fact that divisions in the Council and between Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unresolved."
The Ban called on five permanent members to show solidarity and unity, which they demonstrated when reaching the Iranian nuclear agreement in the solution to the crisis in Syria.
8 poll numbers that show Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to label him as a man who often changes his mind.
The others above the maverick's hand like the unannounced joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But if some Republicans are already trying to get Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they don't (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a two-digit number, and some people start seriously asking what this means for the nominal chance of this magnet from the property area.
Of course it's just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win a Republican nomination.
The experts point out that during this period of 2011, Rick Perry took the lead in taking up Herman Cain, and finally not one of them won the only position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might be in general elections.
But external groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bushe and the Economic Conservation Group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and start spending their dollars on the stand to throw it away.
Here are some recent voting numbers that indicate that the real magnet is not just a mixed phase:
The trumpet rating of the favour was 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's vote showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real magnet.
In mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
The count of three out of ten says they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are held in the initial stages.
After the vote of the University of Quinnipiac, which took place last week, it was found that 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP's volunteers would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey conducted last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans stated that they would be either "insultation" or "satisfaction" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 admitted that they would be "burnt" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same level of excitement as Trump (43 per cent of people said they would be "inspired" against 40 per cent who say the same about Trump).
Next closest to the level of excitement?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republican volunteers claim to be "unsatisfied" or "angrily" if they prefer Jeb Bush to become a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticised for his bouts and insults, 52 per cent of the Republican volunteers are fully inclined to think that the real magnet has the right temperament for the president's post, according to a Monday's vote ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held at the Iowa Senate State Club, which is the first in the whole country where 52 per cent of the Republicans think they have the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent feel that he has no personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independents say that his temperament is not part of the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to this idea.
When he puts on his student hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question which most likely wins the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 spent their money on the Jeb Bush.
Full publication: The GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
During the last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry as the winner of the 28% nomination for Mit Romney.
However, it is shown that a certain number of GOP fans see the Trump campaign as credible.
Although the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump will also defeat almost everyone.
Some students stress that the scattered field is probably contributing to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is disseminated widely among more than a dozen other candidates.
But Monmouth University's research from the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical direct battle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always receives most support.
He runs over Carly Fiorini by 13 points, Marc Rubem by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jebe Bushem by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christ by 33 points at everyone.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead a merchant with a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one match.
The vast majority of Donald Trump's students claim they've already made their own opinions.
The new Tuesday CBS/NYT survey shows that only more than half of Trump’s supporters claim that they will no longer change their views.
Clearly, many things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 per cent indicates that they are leaving an open rear door for change between candidates.
However, Trump is currently the strongest opponent of his external neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans allegedly agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violents" in his campaign's announcement campaign, immigration is still held as the main and central theme of the 2016 conversion.
Some are afraid that Trump's buoyancy removes key Hispanic voters from the Republican side and causes damage to rebranding.
But according to a new Sunday public opinion poll ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the shadow of the reflectors, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Frustration from the government reaches new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive nearly half of the support from the Republican volunteers, especially in view of their foreign status.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post vote say they want a political outside rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry with Washington.
The vote of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 per cent were "unsatisfied" and 21 per cent were "inferiorly angry."
The survey supported a higher share of the State’s carbon charges.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
In the first reading, the Separatist House supported the Government's new top law, which adjusts the amount of the tax on the surface load of coal from the mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised Members that they would also receive money from the public treasury and the budgets of the municipalities.
The proposal was criticised by members of the opposition, who fear that companies will no longer want to sponsor the country as yet, because they will pay higher charges directly to the state budget.In the first reading, the House supported the government's new top law, which means that the state should receive more of the proceeds of the tax on coal from the mining companies.
The share of the state is increasing by 67 per cent, while the share of the municipality is falling from 75 per cent to 33 per cent today.
The proposal also changes the way in which the non-growth compensation is calculated by companies.
The change in interest rates is expected to bring 427 million crowns to the state treasury more than in 2013.
According to the government, the budget revenue should have a neutral impact because the fee should be higher.
In the spring of the year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns from fees and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
There were about 200 million kroner and 66 million kroner.
Novela is also calculated by increasing the yield from the area with a permitted load of 1000 kroner per hectare per year.
The receipt from these gardens shall continue to be of the full scope of the municipality.
The minister of industry Jan Mladek (ČSSD) told the MPs that this has resulted in a total of 14 million to 100 million crowns each year.
The amount of the fee will no longer be fixed by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
Recalculate the refund as a component of the amount of unladen vegetation and the rates for individual species of vegetation.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, inter alia, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, the ODS Messenger Marek Benda warned that the fixing of a fee by a government regulation should not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Młádka, this is not a tax case because the state is making up for the government's own property.
Fees shall be granted only to foreign nationals whose territory is affected by the movement.
In the event of deep carbon leakage, three quarters of the city's money and a quarter of the state will be obtained.
The same ratio will also apply in the case of radioactive mines.
The part of the money that will be charged from the levy will be targeted.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after work or to provide a banana rescue service.
The proposal was criticised by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that they would harm the villages affected by the burden and countries.
For example, Michal Kucher (TOP 09 and the Seniors) warned that businesses would no longer want to sponsor the village as far as they were going to pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve its budget," said David Kádner (Usvit) elected in the Ústek region.
Prior to the increase in unemployment in Mosttecka, Ms KSCHM, Han Auliká, warned.
Kádner and Aulička were unsuccessfully proposing to refuse again, the Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for processing.
In the explanatory report, according to the companies, the increase in fees is not expected at the price of coal because prices are more than 90 per cent long-termly agreed.
Therefore, the main consumers such as power plants or heat plants should not feel an increase in prices.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that trade unions will compensate for the increase in wages to reduce their operating costs, which would, in particular, mean reducing the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in charges from the point of view of employment is exacerbated.
According to the report on the new Milan Urban (CSSD), it is crucial that Members know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on carbon limits before the adoption of the law.
If coal is too heavy for limits, then it will have an impact on the benefits for both the state and the country, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with the Younger that the decision to break the border at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should fall by 2020.
The limits below the ČSA should be broken by reason of social, national economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Happy will lead the Czechs as one, setting up the weather.
All four Czech dancers will appear at the Thursday drawings of Davis’s cupboard in India on the table and this time each one will probably hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Vrátil plans that, given the difficult conditions, he will spread the burden on the whole quartet.
In Dillí there is a hot and high humidity of the air, which is why it is expected that heavy fighting will take up to five hundred.
We've got to get this straight.
I'd like to spread it by weather.
And according to what it would look like, he said he came back at today's Czech election training in the center of Raje Kumár Khanny.
With one team and the world's forty-five Jiřím Wesselim he counts for the Friday and Sunday double.
It is likely that Lucas Rosol and Radek Štěpánek will be in position.
I'd like to get involved with almost everyone.
I've got it in my head, but I'm not gonna say it until now, Captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech constitution should be Štěpánkova's participation in the Saturday quarter.
It's just a question of who's going to stand next to the experienced deliist who's got a cup in Davis's four-quarter balance sheet 18:4.
It's probably not going to be happy.
There's still room for Rosole or Adam Pavlás.
"I really don't know who and what it's gonna look like," said Return.
It's determined by the development of two times.
The variant can be Pavlásek, with Happy surprised in the 1st round win in fat over Australia.
"He's to the dubious," said the Return.
I did it against Australia, and when I play, I'd like to do the same performance I've shown there since the second set.
"I'd like to bring a point for these experiences," said Paul.
The home is set to two Yuki Bhambris (125th in ATP) who won the challenger last week in Shanghai, where players won the third and fourth hundred.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164.).
They're both challengers and our ATP Tour experience, but we've been convinced many times that the frogs in Davis do not decide.
"He decides the momentary form, the weather," said Return.
Five start-ups start at 6:30 SELČ and can be drawn because of the weather.
According to the predictions, it's raining and the jacket is not under the roof.
However, it can be played for artificial lighting.
They've already burned it and it's got some two thousand luxes, which is enough.
"It should be recorded under the lights," said Return.
Jeremy Corbyn will start with Prime Minister's Questions
Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ is very eagerly expected from his election
The new team leader Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut in Prime Minister's Questions later, and he will first have to work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions allocated shortly after noon, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and the MPs.
In his weekly statement he asked for "less theatres and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip several sessions that he would leave his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test by Mr Corby, who comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Leader’s decision to remain silent during the national hymn song in the service on Tuesday to the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is a focus of several stories on headlines.
Mr. Corby's decision not to sing a national hymn drew attention
Speaking Mr. Corby said he would "stand in silence" and recognize "the hero of the royal flight in the battle of Britain."
However, a member of the shadow cabinet of Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, announced to BBC Two's Newsnight that the Labour Leader would recommend that the national hymen sing "without regard" to his conviction that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve at the top of Mr Corby's team, cited differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties initially supported him as leader.
The BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that the political differences in work are also "organised" after Mr Corby's appointment through his position in the European Union and the governmental limit of doses.
Mr Corbil stated at the TUC conference that the Working Party had submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, stated that the party "very clearly" opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Acting Party to which David Cameron has faced for the past decades since his election as the leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the working party, who promised a different approach to politics, said he had ideas "from the bottom" on questions for Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that PMQ is too confrontational and that it will be held back as "prepared responses," as it were, and instead promises that it will focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow business secretary, will represent him at PMQ when he is not present — such as when Mr. Cameron is away from abroad.
He also left out the idea that he would allow other colleagues to step out of his office from time to time because he had heard that he was still discussing the whole matter with the spokesperson John Berc.
When Mr Cameron became the leader in 2005, he said he wanted to stay away from the "Punch and Judy" policy style, which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later he admitted that he failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as the key barometer of the decision of the leaders, their management of the camera and their position among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become cartoonists and that they need far-reaching reforms.
"Photo by Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place for homeless people.
But one group of former children found a way to learn and make a living.
"I was photographed in Johannesburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money like that.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Libra rises, while wages increase in the United Kingdom accelerates
Libra jumped the following data and showed the recovery of British wage growth, while FTSE 100 was led up by the offer target SABMiller.
Between May and June profit including bonuses rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
It was the fastest since 2009 and it seemed as if the estimates were approaching when the rates would rise.
Sterling stepped more than 1% towards the dollar at $1.5505 and was 0.84% up towards the euro at €1.3730.
FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped by 20% after he got near the offer from his AB InBev rival.
The agreement would combine the two largest beermakers in the world, and bring close to brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from the Richemont luxury group.
The latest Richemont sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, began to climb again.
The stock in Glencore stood up by 5% after the trainee giant said they stood by $2.5bn using a shared location as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Stocks in the package and paper group Mondi were the biggest loss on the index and fell by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs reduced his rating on the company for "sale."
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sports company announced 83% jumps in half a year in profits before taxing £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could damage expansion
Executive President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a higher minimum wage for workers in the United Kingdom could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would exceed the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
The costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, which could mean less new jobs.
The resistance of the Prague apartment marchmeloun is waving.
The controversial building got a lead.
The investor Prague Progetti e Investmenti considers that the decision is void and will be appealed against.
Against the construction that is to occur in the close proximity of the Anežka monastery in central Prague, protested before the Prague office of 1 hundred people, there were also petitions.
The judge found in the decision that there had been a violation of the building law because not all the relevant parts of the territorial decision had been respected.
"The subject matter of the territorial decision does not include certain aspects, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the sufficiently clear and understandable form of the building, the definition of the areas affected by the impact of the building," the decision states.
It also considers that some of the basis for the decision was issued for the initial documentation discussed but changed.
For example, it's about the opinions of environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to occur on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the written material that, however, the owner of the land has only given consent to the project documentation for the land management, not to the location of the building on his land, the construction committee writes.
According to Francesca Augusta Razetta, an investment firm's construction policy committee did not take note of the decision of the managing authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for the initiation of the review has already expired.
Anyway, it's a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we respect all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," said Rasetto in a press release.
The project, which people are called marchmeloon because of the allegedly proposed color of facades, creates a strong emotion in Prague.
In the center of the city, hundreds of people gathered in the past to protest the building.
The association and the residents of nearby homes trouble that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticise the inadmissibility of the building for the historic centre of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Anežka monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Franek, the project changed several times.
The original format of the 2008 project, which was calculated with a simplified facade, rejected the Ministry of Culture, based on the opinion of the National Monumental Institute (NPU) and cancelled the authorisation of the Praguen monuments in 2010.
The new project of Prague Projecti e Investimenti with face-to-face windows was approved by the NPU as well as by the Magistrate Memorialists and was based on this building permit.
The author of the proposal rejects the objections, because he never counted with a pink facade that gave the project a nickname after pink sugar.
The Czech policy has bound the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in the bass with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On his way, he took three Syrian refugees with his crew into the car, who were about half a mile away.
He said it wasn't punishable in Hungary at the time, he said to the People's News.
We knew that law-enforcement guards didn't do that.
But when the police stopped us, we were arrested for our surprise and transferred to the investigation camp in Szeged, he wrote a letter.
At the end of politics, he spent nine hours.
The cops were acting right, but communication was tied up, because they didn't have too good English.
However, he felt that prison was sad.
For example, in our cell about three times four meters of size, 15 refugees from Syria were forced to flee.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were already locked up there on the second day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what was going to happen to them, Berg said.
What can't be fun anymore?
Ask the President of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday 18.9., from 9:30, he will answer the readers' questions by answering the President of the Chamber of Executives of the Czech Republic, Mgr. Pavla Fuchíková.
You can ask her for changes to the enforcement law applicable from 1 September 2015 and other matters related to the executions or executions.
Metcash launches campaign on the countryside to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA business from Aldi's efforts in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches campaign on the countryside to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 shops in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brand by marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are added with brands such as the Simmo's ice creammaker based on Dunsborough, offering tastes in IGA shops and shop owners are selling cheap tickets to local customers on the Australian football team.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and hardware vendor celebrates its annual investment strategy day.
There is a lot in the bet because South and Western Australia account for almost 30% of Metcash IGA's trade steps and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notorious provincials and IGA stores use a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30% in SA and 24% in WA compared to about 14% in eastern states.
Anyway, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will rely on 5 per cent of the food market in these two countries over 12 months since the opening of the first shops that took over the markets from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week in his report analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that retail IGA could lose $360 million on annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in southern Australia and 30 in the west during the next year and will generate sales of 500 million and 600 million USD in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in a firm price base of Metcash could amount to around USD 13 million on the income before tax, Mr. Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing its share in the markets in the eastern states, especially Aldi and Coles, although Roy Morgan's last study found that IGA's buyers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week the head of the Hamish Douglas Fund, founder of the financial group Magellan, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "highly likely disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglas' comment.
But it is known that a member of the Metcash delegation contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA fell from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and Metcash's food sales profits, which provided around 1200 IGA retailers, fell by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculation because sales and profits are under pressure.
However, wholesale has gone into counter-attack and invests more than USD 150 million a year in order to match the pulse prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and thus helps IGA retailers to reequilibrate their shops by adding fast growing food and news from the private.
Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrice, argues that the price alignment and the acquisition of trades are falling and hopes that the great-grandfather will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Dennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his glory more than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a further loss in his recent adventure around his friend Nick Kyrgiose and deserves his praise rather than criticism, says President Dennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks", drew unwelcome attention to himself thanks to an affair with an unfavorable Kyrgyz and Stan Wawrink on Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, they must have been Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison separated by a judge twice, Harrison then declared: "Wawrinka had one to pull Kyrgyz and I had to pull him too."
While he was last seen smashing the rocket after the cracker had blown up Richard Gasquet's possible defeat at the US Open, Kokkinakis was invinciblely defending Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth on the second double after Bernard Romice in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensively about the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little involved in the whole dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost it because of his cricket in the US, but he's not the first player who, because of his frustration, would blow his own heart out on his rocket. I know Thanasi pretty well and I can say he won't be proud of this.
But he really managed very well because he was exposed to a very provocative situation in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves great recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He's a very grown 19-year-old man, working very hard and falling into the team great and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the dress, he's practicing hard, he's in a wonderful condition, he's a very stable and mature young boy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to review Kyrgiose because of an important match that begins on Friday, and states that the "reciprocal decision" is the right solution for all, but supports a relative from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term stand.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the fight, not on all the controversy that has arisen around him [Kyrgios],” Healy says.
And I think that Nick got up very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, in the eyes of the public, he's also made a few terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's got, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time outside of the broadcast, when he can think about it, is in my opinion the best solution for the team and also for himself.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of the state of threat, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to stop migrants from crossing it.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country and the Serbian authorities reacted in revolt.
Those who have spent an unknown period in the fields of the country between two states are those who flee from violence in their home countries and settle.
But there's a feeling of frustration.
When the helicopters fly over them, migrants call together "Open Borders!" and give orders to the Hungarian police.
Some reject food and water for protests.
Serbia's foreign minister declares it was "unacceptable" to send refugees back from Hungary, while they are still arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
During the next few days it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The riots at the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the 28-nation bloc did not come with a single immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and spoke with hope of reaching a possible agreement next month or at the end of the year, which the EU nations would accept more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria approved a special European Union summit on Tuesday next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not turn its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
The security situation in two southern regions has given authorities greater power to tackle the crisis and has allowed them to close the roads and speed up the trials of asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto said that his country is also planning to build a fence from the rest of the line along the border with Romania to stop refugees who are trying to cross their country once the fence has been completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D ́Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped to pull the remaining wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months Hungary has become the main weakness and point of entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled from Syria and other countries of the Middle East.
However, the President of the government, Viktor Orban, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are pursuing a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, which is a view that is clearly different from that of other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary are now criminalizing violations of the 4-metre area that the government has allowed to build on the southern border with Serbia, and also establishes longer prison terms for those who illegally translate refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring the state of danger," Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
In this we are quite clear: the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, Parliament still has to approve the deployment of an army that was waiting for next week, but the reporters of the Associated Press on the border have been observing a heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, adviser to Orban for domestic defense, said that the authorities had caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 had already been captured in the state.
They have been breached by damage to the area and are now accused of committing crimes under new laws in police custody.
The authorities were quick to fix the plot.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two out of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a train covered by the rest of the line.
During the main border crossing at Roszke, chaos occurred because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and people's pressures.
About 20 of them went inside, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main road connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's show before Bernie Sanders reduced by half in national vote
The former foreign minister Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit jump at the Democratic National Nomination Race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is getting her jump.
Clinton now supports 47 per cent of the democratic primary elections (down from 58 per cent), while Sanders is in second place 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce his wish to become president, has been supported by 15 per cent of the democratic primary wishes.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters claim that it is too soon to say that there are clear decisions which the candidate will support.
But Clinton sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll, Clinton lost ground under his feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders won several.
Clinton keeps a big leap between women and calms down, but her leadership is tightening.
Her support between men has dropped significantly and Sanders loses only 5 points on it.
The benefit of Clinton's democratic voters has grown to less than 50 years, and now they are equal to Sanders.
Clinton, however, still has great leadership thanks to his older fans.
Last month, Clinton had a double jump in front of Sanders between liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic primary elections in all states say she would be very supportive of Clinton if she became the candidate of the party.
The quarter would support it with certain awards and another 15 per cent would support it only because it is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It's probably not surprising that Clinton's current attachments are especially the result of her conviction.
The views are mixed between those who currently do not support Clinton - only a quarter would support it.
While 48 per cent of democratic primary voters say that they would be very supportive of Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most frequent answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), she follows that it is time to be the president of a woman (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
There is also a great opportunity to choose and agree on problems.
While the vice-president is considering a potential candidate for the president, 57 per cent of the democratic primary voters would like to see a third of them think that they should not run again.
When primary democratic voters were asked who would be chosen as the second choice for the party's nomination, Biden was the most frequent choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, she introduced more than half of Biden as their second choice, far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to nominate the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's leadership will extend from 20 points when Biden will run for 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of the democratic volunteers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win in general elections; however, this figure fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is a far second in this measure, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely to be elected increases.
However, when it comes to the question of the importance of the candidate, democratic voters give priority to dealing with problems before a greater chance of election.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate shall appear as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among their primary voters.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Poor of all three leads honestly, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of the democratic primary volunteers do not think that Clinton is honest and credible, that is, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not.
The primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological perspective.
As for all these measures, about a quarter of the democratic volunteers have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions concerning Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal e-mail and server as state secretaries continue, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of this matter and say that their overall view of it has not affected her at all.
But among the American public, it's a completely different story.
Half the Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this issue was already divided in March, shortly after this problem emerged.
Most Americans claim that this e-mail dispute has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent have worsened their opinion of Clinton.
It's mostly Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their opinion on Clinton has deteriorated.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and confidential among her voters, this issue is still a problem among registered voters in general: only 32 percent see it as honest and confidential, which is reduced by eight points from last month, and by 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered volunteers don't think they're honest and confidential.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered volunteers across the country do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were the best leaders.
Sanderse sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of fans didn't think of him.
The error spread in sample 351 of the primary democratic wills is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up behind Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest survey and the others are not looking for support.
Voters from a number of Republicans throughout the country continue to support Trump by a bold majority, with 23% of the support being provided in the last CBS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month, 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% at the same time.
The study also found that Carson runs well across demographic groups, and excludes Trump from the university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the governor of the state of Ohio John Kasiche, is, in addition to the Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, entirely in favour of 10% support, down to 2%.
Former governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The error range for sample 376 Republican volleyballs in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson has improved and achieved 19% support among Republicans for Trump 32% support.
The latest research from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is ahead of Carson.
At Carson’s rising trend, Trump decided to shoot blind to the neurosurgeon in his position, and even Carson apologized for questioning about Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the brotherhood accused of the death of the student of the first year of Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died during a brotherly ritual in Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a charge of murder was filed against five people.
The members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening of the ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police announced.
Policemen say he had eyes tied up, he had 30 pounds full of sand on him and was repeatedly bothered when he tried to reach the target through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about the headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of Pi Delta Psi did not call the brotherhood 911 immediately after Deng dropped, and allegedly waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, the police say.
However, they found time to take over Deng's dress, to expose his symptoms and contact Andy Menga, the state president of the brotherhood, and to ask him for advice, police chief Chris Wagner introduced the press conference.
"At this moment, members began to hide their equipment and essentially gave priority to the welfare of the brotherhood before Michael Deng's life," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't bring him back to life and died the second morning.
According to the song report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a stupid object in his head, body and stamina.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of the inter-marriage overcrowding and at least one student dies every year because of the overcrowding since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in a statement.
The brotherhood and its members must be responsible, and this step is important by the authorities.
The Grand jury of Monroe County recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr Menga, will also be charged with assaults on charges and criminal coercion.
"We want to keep not only those involved, but in case there is an organization that approved it, whether officially or informally, we will also start responsible," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the nation’s brotherhood disrupted its relationship with local branch offices.
This happens when Fed increases interest rates
The growth of interest rates will come and the market will collapse, the outcome of debt will fall and the economy will fall into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy, it offers a history of a small origin of timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve System in increasing interest rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That's why U.S. Central Bank officials stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the interest rate increase begins, but rather on the trajectory of how long it will take to normalise.
There are really more variables in the game.
Finally, however, market members can ensure that all speed increases can be exceeded.
"The first increase in Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of cheap money," said Julian Jessop, the global economy leader of Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of American interest rates to a more common but still low, creating a seismic shock that many might be afraid of.
That means there are adverse effects.
Here is a view of how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
In view of what the market has recorded in the last cca month, the expected increase in rates may make the air a little unsteady.
But once the increase occurs, the effect won't be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for the re-stopping of shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the changeover in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the increase in Fed.
In fact, the market for the last about 35 years is often the most - about 14 percent - aimed at increasing rates in a proportion of 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent) and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average result of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the main action strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the stock tends to become more significant later in the rate increase cycle and the return is beginning to decrease.
Recession is really economic life, but increasing rates often help her.
At the present time, the Fed faces certain conditions that have not yet existed and that could speed up the recession.
The most remarkable is that the rough domestic product is close to its lowest point in history in increasing Fed's rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during 118 increases in rates since 1950, the nominal annual GDP growth was only twice below 4.5 per cent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, little to expect its maintenance, when in the third quarter it was only 1.5 percent, says Atlanta Fed.
Increasing rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question could arise, "Is this time different," said Deutsche.
Market participants have been preparing for Fed's growth all year and all eyes have turned to the meeting of the Federal Committee for the Free Market, which took place this week and ends Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that FOMC could approve growth at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the expansion cycles have been in the supercycle of raising the peace effect with HDP covering the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report says.
On the contrary, this was a clearly slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is far longer than the Fed expected since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are 74 months old and continue.
The firm result was also volatile because the market expects a rise in interest rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the stock enjoys.
The main difference is that the impact is faster visible in debt securities than in actions when the Fed changes policy direction.
In the case of bonds, the income appears to change the direction immediately after the first income of the increase/decrease cycle.
At the end of the cycle of raising the income of the bonds is falling immediately," Deutsche said.
Strategic Charles Schwaba believes that increasing interest rates will bring the benefits of long- and short-date bonds closer together, which is equal to the curve.
High-performance bonds often work better in this climate, even though "we are still careful about the performance," Kathy Jones, a firm analyst for fixed-income in Schwab, said in her analysis.
It's interesting that Jones thinks markets are already adapted to expect Fed's policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the downturn in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flat, the credit spread has expanded and the volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed reinforces politics.
In general, companies that carry out most of their business in the United States win after growth in interest rates and local products become more attractive.
The multinationals with a lot of debt will get worse, as the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be higher.
"History shows that the "quality" of action tends to prevail over the course of three months after the initial increase in rates," said Goldman Sachsen in a customer report.
Strong-balance-sheet companies faced weak balance-sheet companies in any increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 on an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital earnings, as well as low-volatility stocks, also exceeded their average lower quality counters by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will become a big problem.
The company with a high percentage of moving interest rates loses most, Goldman said.
Besides purely action games, consumers are also weighed by the rising dollar.
Peers can also see their profits through higher earnings, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, said Ambassador Andrew Bingham
Conservative Ambassador Andrew Bingham criticised this station for "insanity"
It stands to believe that he is still more indistinguishable than his commercial rival.
He also focuses on BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on the British
Ambassador's colleague Damien Collins attacked Voice and said he's not the original idea.
BBC Radio 3 is "changed" in Classic FM, a hard forwarder and collecting fresh air pressure on the broadcast to prove that they're doing something that commercial broadcasts don't do.
Conservative Ambassador Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service advertising station seems to be "crazy" and is still more indistinguishable than his commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be--I don't like using the word "sucked"-- but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be Britain under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that attack me when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The Director General of the BBC's indictment refused to explain that BBC Radio 3 is far from his commercial opponent in terms of living music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to living music and creating music is actually at the peak level.
"So I think that the commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, the governor of BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before, because the British are less educated as regards classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that got caught up in the fire because of the suffocation of commercial competitors during the broadcasting of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the Commission.
Conservative Ambassador Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated price of £22 million.
You see why this program is being discussed as a non-original and not so different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the seven stars Paloma Faith aBoy George as a judge - was produced "by a typical way for BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit from its own state" when the next time he started a fun series.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of more future series of The Voice series or the loss of money from the fees payable by the licensee to other entertainment formats.
Internet sales growing at the slowest rate since August and on wine can be Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded 7% increase in online sales
Last month the lowest growth has been recorded since the year 2000 started the record itself
Internet sales were boosted three years ago due to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for slowing down the loss
For more than a decade, virtual shopping was on the rise, and thanks to it, many of the main British streets became cities of spirits.
However, experts claim that there are signs of online sales, and new data show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure in August was the lowest growth increase since the beginning of the 2000 measurement alone, with an increase of only 5 per cent compared to last year.
Experts claim that there are signs of online sales, and new data show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the growth level in the last year and go back to 2000, the situation has always been rationalized over time," says the Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Market Index.
It explains that internet sales were strengthened three years ago, when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the couch.
But now (growth) is kind of stagnant, and that's why it looks like it's coming back.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was wanted from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could withhold purchases from this event that takes place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average buyers turned to their computers to make purchases and yet agree to several sellers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which allows buyers to re-contract, can keep customers from other purchases
The research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was lost online.
For some products such as television and washing machines, more than a third of sales are carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion shops.
The Muslims buried the victims of the fall of the locusts in Mecca, and the family Bin Ladina was punished
The 29 dead bodies were transported by Muslim streets during the first funeral in Mexico
Saudi Arabia partially blames the collapse of the Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health stated that a total of 394 people were also injured after the drought disappeared
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of a fall in the Great Mosque in Mexico.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, the mourners chose the way and gave up the sacrifice when the first of the fallen ones got on his last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
The sad message went through a holy place where only a few days earlier the building workmen broke through the roof of the mosque and threw themselves into the believers.
The bodies were released for burial, and the Saudi king was punishing the construction group of the bin Ládina family over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The 29 dead bodies after the fall of the hurricane in Grand Central Moscow in Mexico were carried away by the streets
Among the dead was the father of the four children of Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first path when the frog disappeared.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual haj journey.
The Saudi officials have already promised that the hajj will take place in Mecca, and thousands of people continue to enter the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group was not supposed to leave the shoulder of the eagle up when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the statement, which is not operated by the Saudi press agency, states that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the fall.
The English service of the disc agency did not report this detail, but stated that travel abroad was prohibited to the head of the company.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to discover what caused the fall of the frog into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims cover before the Hadj journey later this month.
Binladin Group did not issue any statements concerning the collapsing of barley and its representatives were not made available for comment.
The Royal Declarations also accused the Group of not using the latest security measures and of lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Tens of locusts surround Grand Mosque in Mexico, which is part of the massive construction effort in front of Binladin Group.
Binladin's family was close to the Saudi ruling family for decades and are carrying out large construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaeda Usama bin Ládin was the son of a waste that the family denied in the 1990s.
The accident took place in the middle of a strong wind and rain only a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on a journey that must be completed by every powerful Muslim at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still staying in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyalas (£ 174,000) will be devoted to relatives of the murdered and the same amount for permanent injuries.
Other injuries shall receive half of this amount.
Chief B&Q argues that East European traders are already working cheaply on the trend
The British still employ more and more craftsmen, said Veronica Laura
The number of educated traders from Eastern Europe is at the point of growth
As a result, 200 Screwfix shops focused on traders are open
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Rupert Steiner, Chief Correspondent for Daily Mail
The British are depositing the bets and shields and handing them over to trained Eastern European craftsmen to work at home.
If you're dealing with a bead or a painter's shield, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing handicrafts to carry out hunting work at home, according to the head of the company for Screwfix B&Q.
Veronica Laury, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns the home network, claims that the large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 additional Screwfix stores aimed at traders and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury says she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores, because eight of the ten shopping decisions in the store make better half.
At present, most male workers are male.
She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends that show more women's households that are conducting more home-settings than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says, "We still have a lot of men working at our stores.
We need to get closer to balance.
In essence, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the decisions on purchases of goods.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, who is one of only five women in the company's steering wheel according to the British FTSE100 index, also restructured her top team to reflect equality between men and women.
Kingfisher is almost alone in that he has half the representation of women between employees including executive and financial directors.
Mrs. Laury says: "It was a conscious decision - the diversity here is an important topic.
So it wasn't hard to find the good women we'd take to us.
Kingfisher reported a loss of profits in the middle of the year and sold after the group had incurred the costs of closing the business.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new shops
Prosinic contribution to 600 kroner employees is in danger.
"It's the justice of even stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of accountability.
The President of the ODS Members Zbyněk Stanjura noted that the one-time contribution is sounding good, but for a long time it would be better for him to be in the standard value because he would have been in the future.
"We have room to find the mechanism we'll set it up," said Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaely Marks (CSSD), according to which the following year was to be valued above the law.
Marks defended the aid by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners who are not pink according to it.
The higher valuation next year would mean the budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are debating each tribe.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) rightly recalled that in the past the pace of valorization has decreased.
The rapporteur, Miroslav Opálka (KSCHM) pointed out that the proposal does not resolve the reduction of real income in 2016 and later.
This right of payment in December is very complicated and perhaps even impossible, he said.
The President of ČSSD Roman Sklenák proposed that the time limit for the discussion of the standard should be shortened within the Committee for 10 or 20 days, even blocking it.
But the committee will have a month in place of the usual two.
The bonus should be going to a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
The money is to go from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The next year's income should grow on average about the stock market.
The contribution should be made according to the pensioner's new people who will have a pension claim or part of it in December.
Those who lost their pension claim in December before they paid it could get it.
However, they would have to apply for the supplement in writing at the latest by the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly valued by January, which is the growth of prices and the third growth of real wages.
This year's pension corresponds to 41.5 per cent of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5 per cent.
Last year's old-age pension was paid by the state final account of 314.7 billion crowns, which amounted to about five billion more per year.
Old-age expenditure represented 26 per cent of all budget expenditure and 46 per cent of all statutory expenditure.
The average old-age pension increased from 104 to 10,714 in the state final account last year.
The Czech Social Security Administration has provided 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 relatively old-age pensions.
Jaqunin has left plans for a political career, will devote himself to science.
The Senate chair, however, had a billionaire according to Russian media.
In the Council of the Federation, he was to represent the Zapadorese Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolay Cukanov, as the candidate of the government of the United Russia, defended his post in Sunday elections with a review.
According to Russian laws, the senators do not choose citizens, but he elects a governor from three candidates whose names are announced in front of the governor's election.
After the elections, the senator from three candidates will choose for himself.
The complication was for Jakunina that in the Kaliningrad area he didn't live 20 years as required by law.
The Kremlin for Jakunina, however, has found an exception to the fact that he is an extraordinary and authorized ambassador to whom the legal requirement of long-term residence does not apply.
The Czech comedy of the tiger theory is over.
The last drop in the presidency of the main hero is the voluntary death of his body, which came with strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janjurová had a discussion about grandfather's life, his old age and his funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he is on a similar path with his wife, Olga - Eliška Balzer.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, he wants to live a decent and free life again.
He wants to get back the government over his life - and as a solution he will choose to flee from the present one, he told the story of Slavík.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in a comedy form, in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would be for Bartoškov, with whom he had already worked on the Invisible Series.
However, the actor who appeared before the camera after a longer break associated with the rehabilitation after a serious illness surprised him.
We made a deal three years ago.
I gave him the script and he said he likes how sad he is.
And he surprised me that he's obviously a fucking sportsman.
Because before the scene was filmed, he was always asking where he was going to sit.
This time he was riding on wheels, walking down the stairs and even going up the hill.
And all of this in record tropical waters, the director's been hit.
According to Bartoška, women take a tiger to make a queen out of it in time.
They're gonna feed him a little bit, but they're gonna close the door right now so he doesn't come up with a chance to play outside the rabbit shop.
And we're trying to tell our movie, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, made Eliška Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also nice, smart, empathic, and she thinks it's good.
But at the same time she's a stalker, and she wants her husband to burn to the ground, but Bajgar has fallen.
The film also resembles the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Allenky - Táňa Vilhelmová and Paula Beretová - and the sons of Erika and Pepika - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech TV and Rozlas and TV Slovensko.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The U.S. Internet company Google promised to provide up to $5.5 million to $132.6 million to organisations that help thousands of refugees travelling to Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday, Google.org, which is charitable to this internet company.
Azerbaijan has cancelled Telic's visit for criticism of human rights violations.
The Czech Member of the European Parliament for the motion of the UN Pavel Telička has postponed the forthcoming quarter trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities have today cancelled the official part of his visit.
According to Telikka, this is justified by the EP resolution of last week, which criticises human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which was co-authored by Telikka.
With the decision of the Azerbaijani side, Telička lost the opportunity to negotiate with the official partners and also the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, explained in his Brussels office's press statement.
The road, which was planned a few months earlier, Telicka wanted to use it to meet with Parliament's leadership and executive representatives, as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, clarified the text sent by the ČTK.
The EP resolution condemns "invisible repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political prosecution.
The resolution was adopted shortly after a recent ruling on Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadiz Ismail, who was committed to uncovering corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out that it builds its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovski did not exclude from his visit Novosibirsk the future Russian airport in Syria.
We don't have any plans yet.
Nothing's out of the question, he said.
Russia already has a summer sea base in Syria in port Tartus, which has so far been used as a service and logistics centre.
According to Russian press reports, from the beginning of August, supplies of Russian weapons and military material to Syria were stooping.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to establish an airport at Latakia, which for the time being remains the garden of Syrian President Bashar Asada.
Washington, however, does not have any specific military intentions of Russia in Syria completely clear, American commentators agree.
US Foreign Minister John Kerry spoke to Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday about the situation in Syria, it was their third phone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is published in Moscow to explain his concern about the gathering of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The spokesperson of the White House Josh Earnest marked the support of Asada from Moscow for the lost bet.
Russia's policy objectives in Syria are more unclear.
According to him, Moscow made its satellite from Syria.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is following a longer-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not quite clear.
The war in Syria is to be the main theme of Putin's talk, according to today's Russian press speculation, at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York.
On the contrary, the Russian leader is not willing to talk about the situation in Donbasa.
According to today's report in The New York Times, the U.S. government does not exclude President Barack Obama from meeting with the Russian President during the UN meeting.
But the views between the White House's advisers are still emerging.
Tass Agency today, recalling the words of Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, wrote that Putin had not yet met with Obama on his New York residence program.
Place sesame oil on the stomach diet, the rope helps to strengthen immunity.
The good way to increase the strain of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
All healthy substances will remain in the oil when the seeds are harvested.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as glucose.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
They have been the most frequent cause of the Czech death, according to the Czech Institute of Health Information and Statistics for several years.
Glucose inflammation is mainly affecting women, helping sesame oil.
If you are among the lovers of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil, which is part of the original recipes for exotic foods.
Unlike most other oils, it is also used in heat treatment and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used during the stomach diet.
The essential fatty acids that contain are a good prevention of the formation of yellow stones.
These are due to 90% of the cause of glucositis, and women suffer from these problems 3 times more often than men.
In general, problems with the stomach are particularly common among overweight people who do not carry and consume many animal fats.
Sesame oil can be used successfully even with a liver diet that is very similar to that of the gallbladder.
If people want to benefit from all the health benefits of this oil consumption, they should pay attention to products from exotic food stores.
Producers from Asia often use overripe seeds that have a greater taste.
Oil, however, is about all the active substances, described by Ladislav Haczecký, the executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovsk, who produces bio virgin olive oil.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unsweetened white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our fox will be able to draw 8 kilos of sesame.
The raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees by mechanical casting and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation of extra domenic.
At higher temperatures there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil thrives in heart and nerve diseases.
The Czech favorite among the oil is the sun.
The research of Jarmila Hammerské, who led the Masaryk University, revealed that he preferred it in the hot kitchen by 43% of the respondents.
However, it is not really suitable for digestion, and at 180 °C it begins to overheat.
It is better to use it, for example, for salads and is especially suitable for dieting, which helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which reduce cholesterol levels from all fatty acids.
In problems with the heart, attention should be paid to the amount of fat and calories taken in total.
For example, there are 62 calories in one sunflower oil spoon, 99 calories in another.
With regard to the energy value of food, it is important to realize that much more suitable natural foods are nutrients than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially adjusted products.
That's why it's appropriate to go after extra virgin oils.
The sunflower lasts as long as the sesame and juicy nine months.
The storage in the refrigerator will continue to sustain.
Old oil people know especially according to the burning taste.
On the contrary, there's no trouble at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Concrete oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of the technical rope are made up of so-called supernutrients, and therefore the rope oil is considered the healthiest of plant oils.
For this designation, the maximum content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids shall be expressed.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself and must be taken from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume it 0.6 grams, but the Icelandic take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Confectionery oil is suitable to be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to enhance immunity and when developing wounds.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential component of cell membranes.
People don't have to use steam oil, they don't have any psychoactive substances.
The fact that you found this oil path to consumption confirms the fact that Bohemia Oil is one of the most sold.
He sells 500 liters a year.
People often use one spoon in the morning.
The oil of the cane is not much of a taste, but it greatly enhances the immunity, advises Daniel Vlček of the beautiful Bohemian Oil company.
According to statistics, they are the most passionate nation of American grillers.
There's 1.4 grids there for one home.
All over the world, then, the most varied competitions are held in grilling, which confirm only the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs in the background.
On the basis of consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of the people in their lives were not grilled.
The whole majority of them then grilled a few times a year.
To make the grilling successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the seams several hours before the heat adjustment.
Which oil is most suitable for this, and at the same time it leaves the health of a beneficial substance when grilling?
It is generally true that during the grilling process itself, you should save yourself.
Experts agree that much of the oil begins to lose its taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils then also lose the body of a beneficial substance, which otherwise we get when we consume oils from food-adjusted foods at lower temperatures.
But it doesn't mean that extra virgin oils won't find their use when grilling.
Terrible oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When it comes to meat, the experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovska will immediately be equipped with terrible oil.
That's wonderful because it adds to the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen there is a unique feature of an increase in the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for roasting and grilling because it has a high degree of burning up to 216 °C.
Even at this high temperature, therefore, as one of the few oils, it preserves the health of the beneficial substance, describes the benefits of the terrible oil Daniel Vlček of Bohemia Oil, which belongs to few Czech producers of this oil from the wine grape.
Experts agree that vegetable oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high levels of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating cholesterol overdose.
Our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals in the vegetable oil.
Thanks to the favourable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
We also help to enhance our external beauty - it improves skin elasticity, it is used in the treatment of acne and helps to care for dry and lame hair.
The chefs welcome the use of the vegetable oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold meals, for example when cooking salads, but also for the heat treatment of meals.
So when grilling, it can be used immediately in two ways, when marinating and when grilling itself.
We keep the meat and the fish safe by sailing.
Three ingredients must be present in the preparation of marinade: oil, acidity and roots.
We deliver acidity, for example, with apple vinegar, and we aim to soften the meat.
Rooting again gives the mass taste and oil preserves and delivers the right crop, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that the horrid oil is ideal for sailing directly because as one of the few oils it can escape through the dark mass.
So the marine meat or fish are ready to grill, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are indicated by the fact that only a few capes are sufficient to prepare the food.
The same applies to grilling.
Some oils are a complete taboo for this way.
This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rape oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling yourself, shake the vegetable with oil, prevent the inflammation of the food.
The necessary part of the grilling is also the preparation of the annexes.
The grilled meat and fish are practically anything - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
The chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, the salt of Horké summer.
You need: • 1 pcs of broccoli • 1 cup of chocolate • 1 cup of pasta • 1 cup of mixture of salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil
Add to the salad mass a mixture of the salad leaves with chopped handcuffs, fried pasta and on large pieces with fried brosks.
Depending on the taste of salt and opiate, you can also taste the milky chili and soy sauce.
Finally, bury a few drops of horrid oil.
For an exceptional taste, then you can season salads with finely baked almonds.
Dissolved sclerosis: not only depends on the medications but also on the patient’s will to fight.
Sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergot therapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only medical care, for example, women with disaggregated sclerosis need advice if they decide to have a child, care for these patients also includes social advice, recommendations in the treatment of housing, etc.
However, all this is not enough: the development of the disease can affect the patient itself in a fundamental way.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and doesn't have to change the style of his life.
As doctors have pointed out, the patient’s commitment is free of the disease’s activity.
For example, it has been shown that regular movement takes a long time when the patient needs some compensation aid, such as a fence.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not suffer from various myths, such as that the disease automatically leads to the end of the vehicle.
That's why the website Daj is a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Daj is a chance.
The most important person to care for a patient with a broken sclerosis is a neurologist.
In the case of broken sclerosis, it has been said twice that the sooner the disease begins to treat, the more the doctor may influence.
That's because we've got drugs on the broken-up of the sclerosis at an inflamed stage when the neurodegeneration process isn't so strong yet.
The sooner we get hit, the greater the hope is that we will be able to stop the disease and remove the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with broken sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often resolves lower limb weakness or imbalances.
He works with patients according to their individual needs: maintaining the condition, improving walking, strengthening the floor floor, reducing swallowing disorders or improving coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the patient's specific problems," says MUDr. Martina Kövari, principal of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic Faculty Hospital in Motole.
Because people with broken sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but in every case, it is a little different.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, movement also reinforces the immune status of the organism, which is desirable in the case of broken sclerosis.
Another positive practice of regular exercise is that patients check everything they can, and it strengthens their self - confidence.
"In practice, the endorphins are also flowing and the person feels good about it," notes PhDr. Kamila Rásová of the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinic Faculty of the Royal Vineyard.
By affecting the physical page, we affect the limbic system responsible for emotions.
That's how we get into the psychiatry and immune processes and stabilize the disease, it adds.
"Before these patients were so investigated, today we know that they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, the privilege of Rehabilitation Clinic and Physical Medicine Faculty Hospital in Motole.
The goal of physical therapy is to keep a person as self-sufficient as possible, including working class.
Therefore, physiotherapists cooperate with ergot therapists so that each person can receive compensation from his ears in peace.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult situation.
When you have a serious illness, most people will be shocked.
They're experiencing shock, panic, fear.
She has to respond to a great deal of stress - a loss of health.
With such a troubled soul, we should follow someone, not try to take everything away on our own stomachs.
"I work with them so that they finally come to the conclusion that even with a disability, a life can be full and that a fragmented sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubert from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague producer Latecore, airbuses wouldn't fly.
Aerial production is a synonym for accuracy and advanced technology.
New aircraft are filled with titanium or light and solid composite materials that someone can't immediately produce and process.
However, along with super-precious, computer-controlled machines, along with autoclaves for the formation of composites, it is possible to attack something as common as the merunian pecks.
In the drum, which reminds of a cane on the sugar wool, there is a favorite of the edges of the sheet parts that have just come out of the milling machine.
"No one has come for anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, Director General of the manufacturer of the latecoeer Czech Airport.
In the area in the Prague Latvians, the former Flight's complete door for Airbus A320 is produced.
As the only ones in the world, they deliver the doors to the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, which form part of Prague, also enter passengers into the first and higher class on the upper decks of the world’s largest aircraft Airbus A380.
They're also mounting the doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Preciseness is the main motto here.
Maybe the current key lets the company sort it out twice a year.
If there is a lack of control on the yellow label, the Prague competition should explain to the airbus or Boeing auditors who drive regularly whether the doors are manufactured in accordance with the agreed rules.
But advanced technology has not yet completely faked human senses.
On one door to A320 there's 1500 knots.
You've got to untie the netters manually.
It takes them two days.
Even according to the sound of the falling bet, they will know if it is already properly untangled.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The net can range from zero to 0.13 millimetres above the plane surface.
That's about twice the human hair thickness.
A series of trained hmats will come under control.
When the controller passes his finger through a line of nails, he will know if there's any out of tolerance.
Then we'll take the exact angle.
The food year before 1989 was the program of the military military aircraft L-39.
But not one was produced in 1991.
The company had to find new orders quickly.
She then joined the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the selection procedure for emergency door suppliers for model A321.
The deals with Boeing weren't so happy.
"We were for them at that time a small company that did not have enough money to invest and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable deliveries," Dubský recalls.
The door to the American producer would be forgotten if Letov did not attend the Prague conference of the International Aeronautics Association of the French Latecoere Group in 1999.
I was there talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The second day the conversation with the French was broken up, says Dubský.
A year later, Latecoere bought a Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
Immediately in 2000, the installation of parts of the door opened for A320.
Three years later, the upper deck door for A380 arrived.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for the processing of composites due to Boeing Dreamliner deliveries.
Without Latecore, we wouldn't have gotten to those big orders ourselves.
Maybe we could do parts or a little part.
Partners want a warranty delivery for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubský.
Last year, the Czech Latecoeer achieved turnover over 2.9 billion and profits after taxing 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position between the supplier of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague has invested 1.5 billion crowns since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special production processes certificates and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company wouldn't have built any doors to the aircraft.
Obtaining certificates that production processes meet customer requirements and maintaining them in repeated checks is up to the Dublin millions of crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They're more accurate and tighter.
We have to train our employees, get the equipment and re-certify the whole process, Dubský supplies.
The company is now finalizing the process for zinc and nickel coating, which replaces today's harmful cadmium for human health.
They got jobs from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they were using in Prague.
The people from Boeing are coming, checking the concepts of the whole line.
Then we'll lead them to production.
They're also checking our lab.
One set of samples are tested by themselves in their laboratory and then the results are compared to ours, approaching the Dub way the receivers control them.
The reward is long-term exclusive contracts for Prague companies.
The Prague competition stands today and the production of embracers falls.
For A320, it produces half of the total volume of the door.
The replacement of the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European producer.
But it doesn't mean he can say any price at the door.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
It shows how many doors one door will stand after ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces made.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We have to get into this price sample.
If we don't, we'll work it out, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall where the electric boxes are completed for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft is still empty.
But it's a symbol of the future.
Behind the wall there is a new semi-robotic line to be used and the installation door for an innovative model A320 Neo.
The nesting is speeding up and speeding up.
"It's a trend where the installation in flight is dressed," Dubský adds.
The rest of my future line is secure.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of new A320.
Only a few meters next to it will be a line for the complete mounting door for the upper deck A380.
It's our parent company's strategic decision.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full installation could start within two years, says Dubský.
Before then, however, the company must pass the qualification tests necessary for the installation of some electrical and electronic equipment into the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also committed to further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, she should also participate in the new Airbus A350 programme, which will compete with the American Dreamline.
"It is a huge credit for the company when it is able to process other than metal materials," Dubský proudly says.
Latecoere, however, reaches the limit of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There's no place else in Letov's area where he lives.
Prior to the French mother's entry, the company had 180 employees.
Now he's 800 and within three years it could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of us, how many hundred new aircraft are ordered each year, they don't have to worry about working.
Although he has orders for several years ahead, the Prague-based Latecoeer parent company has faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money for the shadow rent.
Finally, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main believers.
At the end of August, some of their loans were exchanged for shares.
The creditors received an increase of EUR 57.4 million in the company's share of 37.4 per cent.
The company's debt fell by two thirds, i.e. by 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company signed a new shareholding of EUR 222.9 million between the existing shareholders.
In total, the basic capital amounted to EUR 280 million.
The whole group, however, weighs on the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which shares 85 percent on the markets.
The average contract growth is expected to be four per cent per annum until 2017.
The contract book has orders of 2.6 billion euros, corresponding to four years of production.
The French media claims that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the caps.
The Czech competition in the Prague Latvians is important for groups.
It contributes 16 percent to group markets.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign side of the group.
The messengers supported a greater share of the State's carbon charges.
The change in interest rates is expected to bring 427 million crowns to the state treasury more than in 2013.
According to the government, the budget revenue should have a neutral impact because the fee should be higher.
In the spring of the year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns from fees and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
There were about 200 million kroner and 66 million kroner.
Novela is also calculated by increasing the yield from the area with a permitted load of thousands of crowns per hectare per year.
The receipt from these gardens shall continue to be of the full scope of the municipality.
The minister of industry Jan Mladek (ČSSD) told the MPs that this has resulted in a total of 14 million to 100 million crowns each year.
The amount of the fee will no longer be fixed by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
Recalculate the refund as a component of the amount of unladen vegetation and the rates for individual species of vegetation.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, inter alia, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, the ODS Messenger Marek Benda warned that the fixing of a fee by a government regulation should not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Młádka, this is not a tax case because the state is making up for the government's own property.
Fees shall be granted only to foreign nationals whose territory is affected by the movement.
In the event of deep carbon leakage, three quarters of the city's money and a quarter of the state will be obtained.
The same ratio will also apply in the case of radioactive mines.
The part of the money that will be charged from the levy will be targeted.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after work or to provide a banana rescue service.
Today's proposal was criticised by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that they would harm the villages affected by the burden and the countries.
For example, Michal Kucher (TOP 09 and the Seniors) warned that businesses would no longer want to sponsor the village as far as they were going to pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve its budget," said David Kádner (Usvit) elected in the Ústek region.
Prior to the increase in unemployment in Mosttecka, Ms KSCHM, Han Auliká, warned.
Kádner and Aulička were unsuccessfully proposing to refuse again, the Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for processing.
In the explanatory report, according to the companies, the increase in fees is not expected at the price of coal because prices are more than 90 per cent long-termly agreed.
Therefore, the main consumers such as power plants or heat plants should not feel an increase in prices.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that trade unions will compensate for the increase in wages to reduce their operating costs, which would, in particular, mean reducing the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in charges from the point of view of employment is exacerbated.
According to the report on the new Milan Urban (CSSD), it is crucial that Members know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on carbon limits before the adoption of the law.
If coal is too heavy for limits, then it will have an impact on the benefits for both the state and the country, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with the Younger that the decision to break the border at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should fall by 2020.
The limits below the ČSA should be broken by reason of social, national economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the American Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the US Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a fundamental decision on whether to increase interest rates for the first time after almost decades.
A study of 80 economists by the Reuters agency found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think that they would remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates between 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event, because it's been sitting for years since Fed reduced interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get out of the zero line and start the process of normalising interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The U.S. economy has been relatively good, has been restored in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned markets to be ready for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see a great chance against this step.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00 SEC.
Delta State University shooter left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day as his colleague - wrote a message saying that he was "summer" his first murder and that he wanted to be able to take it back, revealed it to government authorities on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier in Mississippi said Lamb, a teacher of geography and social sciences at the State University of Delta, called the police on Monday morning about ten o'clock.
And he said he shot someone.
The dispatcher's lamb asked him to send the cops to his house.
He said, "Last night I shot my wife" and he also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house, which "will not poison anyone", but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also didn't explain why he was shot in the house.
When the police arrived at the scene, the body of 41 - year - old Amy Prentiss found a handwritten message from Lamb saying: “I am so sorry and wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the message, Lamb left for 300 miles on his way to Delta University, where he killed the teacher of Ethan Schmidt’s story and then took his own life.
The bishop of William LaForge said that he did not know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “the head of Mr. Lamb obviously played something.”
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in the romantic relationship of Amy Prettiss and Schmidt, the government stated that there was "no evidence" about the "mercy triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss over seven years ago, said she was "a great person".
Divorce came 15 years ago, but they both remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was completely "cut off".
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald said, she was working with Prentiss from the house over the Internet.
Knowles said that Pretissa, who had a hunting dog named Blesk, had been with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," said Knowles.
The police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would not go to prison.
When the cops reached him on the road near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled to the woods where he shot himself.
According to the Life Story, published on school websites, Lamb received a doctorate in the field of education at Delta University in spring 2015.
The Stars That Lost Their Magic
Herec (left), on the picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
In 2001, he fought leukemia and lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer in 2009.
The actor also had a alleged drug problem and in 2008 he was detained for drug possession.
All these things are definitely choosing their own tax.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be several months from the game due to double breaking.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right foot during the defeat of Manchester United in the League of Champions against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this wound in tears and removed him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks that Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The wound caused Héctor Moren's unprecedented action in 15 minutes when 20-year-old Shaw went into the PSV space.
Nine minutes was treated on the playground and there was also a need for an oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's had a double leg fracture and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe in the afternoon and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester when he's 18 years old, it's very difficult, but it's fantastic, and then this happens.
When he was in the closet, he also had an oxygen mask.
He's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture requires six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group phase.
I believe he's still playing this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty cap.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli of Mexico has not been punished.
Van Gall pointed out that the Italian judge was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty step on both legs.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you all for their reports, words can't express how I'm ruined, my journey to recovery begins now and I'll be back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United recorded Luke Shaw's injury in defeat of the PSV
The British defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of a European championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said, "It was a very bad wound."
If any player leaves the playground with such injury, each one of them is very sad.
It's never the aim of our players to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a fracture in his legs in the fight for Mexico against Van Gaalove Holland in the 2014 World Championship.
"It is very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the seriousness of such an injury, it is not good," Cocu said.
I wasn't able to see this moment.
I saw only the ball that directed the other way, so it seemed that [Morena] touched him, but I didn't see the move on Luke.
In the interview for SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel really bad about it. I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
David Cameron certainly knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: When a child loves the book, it will not take long to learn to remember it.
But you can't be David Cameron.
To ask the children's schematics provider to name his favorite children's book, he chose the president of the government of Lorax, a fairy tale from Dr. Seusse in 1971.
It was difficult to choose from, Cameron writes in a report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "It was funny, emotional, creative and with strong content that I loved to read to my children because there was always a picture or message behind it that I had not seen before."
Well, until then, in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the events of books according to a 2012 film excerpt, which added other characters and details to fill out the brief original text.
"In the town of Thneed-Ville surrounded by trees, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, the boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of the girl's dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see the real tree," is the short content of a book that records the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it wasn't suspicious enough, the text added by Cameron is read as a summary lift of the Lorax film, which is on the Internet Movie Database, and begins by saying: "In the town of Thneed-Ville surrounded by a ghost, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, the boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of his girl, Audrey."
Because he was an open practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would get acquainted with the work of a book where an unnamed young man would know that local nature is ravaged by a gruesome, tree-like industrialist Once-ler who, despite the protests of the title Lorax, a shriveled, horny creature who "speaks of trees."
With the highest probability of such a relatively small PR task, an assistant who never read Lorax's baby 20 times in a piece received.
Speaking Downing Street indicated that the text probably came from Cameron's post office.
SuperCams confirmed that the text provided by the employee Cameron, but no further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of England's warning, but he's still holding
To compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after looking at the team that England has chosen on this tour, I think the replay of the 3-0 defeat that she suffered last in the trial series is unlikely.
I wouldn't have ruled out the guests' winnings either.
The page Alastair Cook can be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spina players here in this smoking complex and also collective thought is strong; there are no scars from 2012, only youth positive.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, represents an attackable possibility.
Related: Adam Lyth got out of the England team in the series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to mention Adam Lyth is for me a solid basis for analysis, because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were against two good attacks in challenging conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that players of the cricket are sentenced on the basis of performance.
For example, around the name Joe Root, there were no questionnaires, leading to the announcement because — and I mentioned earlier — players are their best voters.
A few more half-centurys, and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Let's hope that if he can get more runs for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The chief coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position, even though his performances were not completely foot-and-mouth, and I'm not surprised; he was always a team player.
The question of how long the test time will get a sticker to show up is a tough one.
Lyth got seven hats — like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance home and out.
The only thing you could resist is that England gave Jonathan Trott’s first chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was the best — but this frozen opportunity is already past.
Alex Hales is coming, and this is a sticker that I value very well.
It's an x-factory cricket player that we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he won 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this will, of course, depend on the overall composition of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts on Cook's side, which would get another extra spinner while he's keeping four quicks, was brought over and I don't have any compensation against her.
I don't understand why strikemaker can't fire and this left-wing man has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number three for them and there's no big difference in it.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 tests before his performance in 2001.
He was immediately struck for three centuries and didn't even look at himself.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a hostage spinner and when I was able to watch him, he caught me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — an average of 31 with a ball and 35 with a ball — and I see it as a prom, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands, and the voters decided for the young.
There's a lot to learn on this tour.
Despite the team, England seems to have made several changes and smart additions to their training staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardenea, the bats of Sri Lanka, as a consultant for experimental matches may be a master's draw.
He is one of the most beautiful players who bring rich experiences by having experiences with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in the part of a white-ball tour and brings to the team both energy and a cruel spark.
I have always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and as well as Mahela has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dress, even though they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes relax and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham Ben Stokes got a day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many disagree with it, coaches and selectors do not create a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy begins to stagnate by 2017.
The unintended renegotiation strategy of David Cameron for maintaining Britain in the EU is getting into other problems with every last day and without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn is headed by the Workers' Party, or will the TUC take the whole situation around Europe to the parade on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat has recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British self-centered agendas, partial concessions and disruptive changes to the treaties that most of them did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided that they would not want it even if social protection was inflamed.
We can even call it the own agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a photo before the famous local monument, with or without local values, and then return home with the words that they win the union for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an unaccompanied British in Europe - "Do not leave us alone with France," Berlin says - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have reached the point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German cautiously balanced chancellor, is a union, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as it has been for too long thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French Francis Holland faces a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's falling too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how the lame legs with the help of Selfie Brits who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they do not want themselves because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in Britain to speed up the Brexit process, a hard friend.
"The renegotiation has solved the problem" and "British has nothing valuable to negotiate."
Europeans know for their own harm how fierce Fleet Street can be and how skeptical they are to the EU are pressure oligarch barons, because they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, who supported our 1973 entry in ratio 2:1.
They can readily remember the name Boris Johnson, a brilliant Euro-opportunist, who made his name as the Brussels rapporteur "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his ingenuity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of non-paying taxes, foreigners hacking phones and pseudo overseas departments who owned most of the big news.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with gorillas, you have to throw them bananas so she doesn't get you to dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself, when he opposed Cameroon's referendum routine since Blair accepted the principle of a repealed EU constitution, which was undermined by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and obtained an expulsion card.
The press never fired him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who paid me friendly back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he should not waste his time on me - seems to be in danger of re-accepting the boycott strategy of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake even now.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent strategy for media engagement, not with me, but with Andrew Marre, whose chair he left at BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe, I'll say that, they're developing.
He claims to want to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the mad trend of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little England can certainly come to this.
The same said Hilary "Bemm, but not Bennite" Benn on the radio and television this week, when his inner shell couldn't decide that Corby's appointment of abrasive McDonnell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970 ’ s when his old father fought on TV about his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's tail was much more attractive.
But fighting for us to remain "in all circumstances" - Benin's phrase - according to everything that McDonnell said, or what JC said to his colleagues and Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever background they are, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to communicate - do not forget, touched me too - the discipline of the news remains important in the age of everyday television broadcasting and especially in faith, the parson of paranoid and betrayals that social media have
It is fair not to grant Cameron a free entry into Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the Working Party in the referendum campaign, of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnellova and Corby's basic statement on EU membership - according to their Bennite-based economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric debate between leftist dissidents, for which narcissism is the central element of dogmatic exclusion.
As with his statement about NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will have to try to understand the meaning of all this for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of British concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the British "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, and even by reducing the costs of the conservative government in power, as I was reminded of the Monday launch of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticise reviews of electronics published by the Public Health England Agency
The government's statement that electronic cigarettes are 95 % safer than smoking has resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, according to researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the launch of criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by the Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency published a "border" report last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of evidence."
However, a number of researchers questioned the extent of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The leader in the expert magazine Lancet attacked the "extremely chatting base" last month, on which the PHE agency based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who wrote for BMJ questioned the claim that was allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They argue that the public could expect that the assertion of the PHE agency, which sounds "the best estimate at the time, is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people invited to prepare an analysis of the multi-criteria decision (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the damage associated with various products containing nicotine; the results of the discussion were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one of the sponsors of this meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO allegedly had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also approved the public health authority of BAT in the sustainability report, he said.
One of the 12 meeting participants admitted funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding allegedly obtained earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
There are no reasons for selecting panel members, but they contain several well-known electronic cigarettes champions, some of whom also declare industrial funding in the newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in PHE also participated in tobacco management.
The report emerges in this group "excisely admitting," missing "solid evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that saying PHE "there is still no evidence that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoking for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, stated that the claim in BMJ had already been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small, but we still need to examine long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die annually from smoking and smoking-related diseases worth NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly highlighting the current evidence - that even though e-cigarettes are not without risk, they only carry a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should end with EastEnders, former director of Channel 4
Former Director Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give right hand" for an emergency show such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used for programs that are not made by other British television broadcasts.
He criticised the BBC for putting in place public service programmes that are likely to follow only a handful of people, in difficult transmission times against its rivals "the largest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After Director-General Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had unsuccessfully tried to connect with the BBC for six years who worked on Channel 4.
"I'm fighting the idea that BBC is delivering and broadcasting programs that would certainly be broadcast rivals without state contributions," Johnson said in the Communication Commission in the Upper House, as part of the BBC's future negotiations.
If you maintain the licence fees that I am not sure are in the medium- or long-term horizon of good thinking, the production should be reduced at least as far as programmes that others do not produce or fail to do.
They broadcast The Voice in the main broadcast time because they want to get as broad as possible support for the future.
The thought that no one else would send him is a ridiculous joke, and it's incomprehensible.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why regressive tax should support programs that can be financed without contributions.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and understandablely made on the home floor.
Honestly, other channels would give them a peaceful right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasts are.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at least.
Johnson, an entrepreneur in the series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that he felt guilty about making ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comment on the most popular show BBC repeats those former executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that BBC sells the show as East Enders.
Johnson said that even the most vulnerable public service programs of the BBC "are going to BBC4, where it is not often possible to measure obscenities, but they fill their powers and can argue when they are going on their cover mission justifying £4bn from license fees, "But of course we're doing all these shitty programs that nobody sees."
They're broadcasting them at a time when no one's looking at them.
As for the license fee, Johnson said to the Commission: "I urge you to find a more regressive system regarding which one of them will get the best value.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people who are 150 pounds a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look so much at BBC.
Former Director Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should review its reithovous mission in the sense of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production had already been classified as education - it was 1% of television production and 0.1% of radio production - and should take the example of public broadcasts in Australia and Canada and turn to "inform, explain and entertain."
Elstein said that BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were broadcast on television only by a handful, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
“Sonogenetics” or control of the brain cells by means of sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction the slides are moving.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small twitches change direction at a time when they are hit by sound impulses that are inescapable for the human ear.
Pulses function by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and record brain activity using light
Scientists have stated that these worms are a great example of a new method called sonogenetics that uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla in California, stated for the Guardian magazine that one day this method could replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which the patient's brain is subjected to electrodes that stimulate the brain. The method is used, for example, to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms.
Slysts usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction is delivered when placed in liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, the bubbles reinforce the ultrasonic waves that then walk through the worms ’ bodies.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves operate in the ion channels TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open and activate cells with which they are connected, is mentioned in the report of the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the mucous membranes using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.
Then, when he used such modified ultrasound worms, the sound waves were reinforced by microbubbles and moved to the worms where modified motor neurons were activated.
The new method is much like optics, a progressive tool that enables scientists to turn and turn neurons off using light.
Chalasani, however, had heard that sonogenesis could have many advantages against this technique.
Unlike the light that must be sent by optical fiber to the required place in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate the tissue without limitation and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that his application would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture devices - right on your threshold!
Adverts condemning British arms trade.
Look at the video about the anti-weapon market from Amnesty International.
A terrible killer drone!
The ankles on the legs, the ankles!
Three-man shooters!
And electric ominous shoes that cause unbearable pain, but they don't miss any clues!
The cheerful voice and caricature metaphor do not leave anyone in doubt that this advertising at the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to express the will of the British government to sell weapons to repressive regimes through defence and security facilities at the ExCeL Centre in the London Docklands District.

But the individual campaign is also guided by the extraction of posters at bus stops and meters that require a second view.
"Important announcement, Traveling to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" Read one, using the London metro font with DLR lines becomes a picture of the tank.
This September, a series of arms dealers will join the DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are designed by artists who showcase their works at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
A collective name Special Patrol Group has helped to distribute across London and with the help of "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen's key, allegedly "gets access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not covered by this "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and expert assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to spectators outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activists in protest movements and realize that they have to get out of the real world in order to have their art impact on society.
Another of the anti-trafficking posters with health weapons traveling in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed on Facebook by more than 100,000 people within 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without charge for the fee and graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
The creative director of the VCCP Matt Liver would be surprised by the silence surrounding advertising about arms trade - saw an empty space in the calendar ExCeL - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign that is trying to avoid."
They were playing with the creation of more realistic risky corporate advertising, but "by adding colorful colors and animations, I have achieved that more people travel."
"They took a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is that the UK government takes measures and ensures that the torture facility does not deal illegally with our dust.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding arms trade comes from outside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In the press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army to "at the firefighting AT4CS RS."
This includes "a single-shaped head that provides amazing effects behind the armoring inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life at Student College
11 years ago, I moved to college as an unmarked 19-year-old, still believing in bartenders and moral relativism, but until now I am equipped with the heavy smiles of those I've had - and many, prolonged complaints to others.
All I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on to college can move from slightly to nerves that go up to totally alarming.
It's nice to chat: tell people where you're from, if you've taken a year's break, what you're thinking about Corbyn and why "you don't really love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extract from the HAHAA quad, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help the others to breathe too - ask yourself and show interest.
He's doing this conversation and he'll help you find the people you like, and the ones you don't care about, even if your classes were in one fire and they'd issue the extinguishing devices.
Let people have room.
People's rooms often change to drinking receptions, movie evenings and public places, but they're also rooms where people dress and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting high and being in a relationship.
Introverts on high will come soon.
Your room should be a shelter, yet many of the wheels are changing to an outdoor walking culture, which is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendship.
It could be hell for someone who needs a bid.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can go back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to find out when your partner is tired of socializing - and maybe write him down instead.
When it comes to chatting, chatting.
One boy in my class used to be invited inside if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a few things.
Make friends by cooking.
Because you started going to the university at the top of the bakery mania, attaching to a stranger's door, and presenting with a plate of baked cookies, it seems immeasurably less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, something I've cooked for you, now laugh while I ask myself personal questions."
Offering your household chores is a good way to find your friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe everything will end in a way that puts your face at ease with a pleasant surprise.
Of course it's the subject of being a decadent baker.
Badly condensed bites of the bladder, sugar and chew will probably stop the others from pretending to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a regular crime in student colleges.
The theft of the whole chicken is, of course, a crime, but is the drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Check twice with the owner of the milk.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're angry inside.
If someone steals something for you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little bit more adults than my roommates who exchanged their milk by means of washing dishes to punish thieves.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make sounds that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl from my walk asked her neighbors if they could keep the drum and bass quiet because they were 3 at night and she had a letter in the morning.
Their answer was the strengthening of music.
When they finally shut up at 5:00 in the morning, she let them sleep quietly for two hours and then released her own music, locked the door and went to her three-hour letter.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future went to the same college as you?
On the contrary, would it not be extremely embarrassing if you were to mix up your future roommates, sleep together, break up and have to see each other every day and maybe take control of your friends?
Of course, you don't order hearts - but if your sexy roommate is not your future though, try to talk to your weaknesses at least.
In a thrilling moment when you realize that someone has left the keys in his unclosed room, there is only a thin border between fun and joke.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Learn them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock them in the door and give them the keys in the bottle of water which you then pour into the freezer - but never stick their things to their ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins, despite the obvious prospects for the future.
Eve has lived for a while while in her pregnancy with the seven - year - old Witka today.
His father broke up with her and she was alone for the preparation and upbringing of her offspring.
With the situation I was able to cope relatively quickly - I was looking forward to my child and looking for a positive one.
Insecurity and being alone with the child, I was trying not to get hurt.
And I was sure hoping that we wouldn't stay alone for a long time, Eve remembers her first pregnancy today.
She's already met on the Internet in the old Vask chat room that started talking to her about favorite movies.
Vašek Eva and Vítka even brought home from their foster home, but they didn't care too much about the role of their own father.
"Then for a while he withdrew from the program," wrote Eva in documentary series Four in Volume 3.
The reason for the third series of Czech television series is just to find happiness for the second attempt.
The care of Vítka and the family’s financial security was managed thanks to part-time work and the great help of her mother and aunt.
No prospect of being responsible for a foreign child at the end of Vashka’s attachment to Eve.
They definitely got together around the Second Births of Wytk, and he now understands Vaska as his dad, and so does he.
Although Vashek already has two grown daughters, the fatherhood in his 60s uses his words and makes more use of his children.
Besides Witka, another two-year-old Leontyn came to them and finally two-year-olds.
"Yours into our family came in somehow naturally, perhaps by never speaking much of my mother in my relationship," Eva said.
A little space?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born with a imperial cut after Eve was diagnosed with pregnant cholestasis.
This is a disorder in the production and activity of glucoacids, which are then present in excess of the amount of pregnant in the blood and are particularly present in the presence of consciousness.
The disease is dangerous to the unborn child, which is threatened by premature birth and death, in the mother after birth most of them self-absorb.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Evina and Vaskova, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
Emička was placed in an incubator in an intermediate department where Vaskova's niece, who was able to take over and stay.
Elinka was older, and right after moving from JIP to room, I had her with me, describing a difficult period after Eva's birth.
She spent 20 days in the womb until the doctors decided not to allow her babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two pounds.
Waiting to pick up children in Eve’s womb did not make her happy.
"I was crazy about my husband and children," recalls a four - week - old mother.
She also considered signing a reverse with her husband, including because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
Eventually, however, the doctors let Eve and the twins go home.
The stories of four pregnancy and childbirth broadcast ČT1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45.
A whole number of families can be reduced.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to cope with electric doubles and compressed conditions.
The house did not grow, but Vašek made Eve’s joy by installing a gas cook in order to make her food more comfortable for six people.
If it's too bad, we'll take care of the cab.
Eva is convinced that the children are especially concerned about family atmosphere and pleasant atmosphere, not the size or surroundings of the home.
For the time being, we've been doing a lot better than we've been waiting.
The disorder is hidden up in a small space, and the culling baby we sometimes cross, but at least we're all close together, she smiles at Eva, who can find a positive page on every situation.
Vaška's work as a light bulb in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why sometimes they go out to Prague streets as a taxi driver.
In his sixty years, according to his words, care for family finances and children physically manages how long will it be?
"I realize that because of our age difference, I will once be the one who will live this family," admits Eva to the level of questioning the future.
She'd like to get back to work, but she's even more fond of the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not just on time for employers.
And if it's worse, my husband and I can take care of a cab, jokes about a nice blonde.
Apple got no effect.
There's plenty of displays for everything.
The most efficient processor, a camera with a larger resolution, a stronger chess or display recognizing the power of touch, these are in short preference for the recent ninth generation iPhones.
The last two then also have a negative impact on the size and weight of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The actual trend of Apple was that every new generation of iPhone is easier than the previous one.
The exception was only a third and a fourth generation whose weight rose slightly against the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight of the differences in the failure of the news was, however, really negligible.
But it doesn't pay far for new iPhones.
In contrast to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 plus, weight grew in a smaller model of 14 grams, in a larger one of 20 grams.
On one side you can't see, last year's affair with bending in Apple's pockets suffered a lot.
The sixth of the paper is thus made of a more resistant aluminium alloy of 7,000, which was also predicted by weight.
But they have a much bigger impact on her.
Apple used 3D Touch technology for the news, which makes the display recognize the strength of the touch.
To this end, it was necessary to provide another layer of capacity sensors.
The weight of new iPhone displays has increased more than doubled in previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone from the original 12 grams to 29 grams, in case greater then from 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s, this display is the most difficult component to use.
The weight of only 143 grams was then reached by this news, thanks to the thinning skin that affected most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, then, the most difficult element used is the battery, but its weight has not changed in any way against the previous.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is seen right at the display.
Weight 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
As far as new technologies will be practical, they will appear until they are used.
The first users will be able to test this already on Friday, September 25, when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will begin in selected countries.
Are the champions breakfasts for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have succeeded in finding an interesting possibility.
They found traces of modern human settlements from different times, including wall paintings, tool remains, and so on and so forth.
In the 23A layer, which is according to tools dated about 30 thousand years ago, scientists discovered but something that reminds us very much of the rest of the breakfast buffet.
On the spot there were traces of grain, which apparently went through the production process of so popular fibers today.
It's the first thing it's going to do today is wet it, then it's going to dry, it's going to get rid of the packaging, it's going to be the lung, then it's going to sleep and it's going to split up.
In the cave Paglicci succeeded in discovering the grain that was all heated or sprinkled, and then apparently broken between two millstones - at least indicate the rates of use on two stones in the cave.
So scientists have not been able to prove in their PNAS magazine that a complete process of hair production is taking place in the cave, but the similarity is really very imaginary.
We also have no evidence of how the people of the hair could eat, but the idea that it was with some fluid and maybe even heat is, of course, quite logically offered.
At the same time, it is a very interesting document of how intensively people used crops long before farming.
If, therefore, the flag interpretation is correct, the oldest flag has been taken over by agriculture for about twenty thousand years.
New report of stations in the Transport Company of Brno.
So I once again listened to the name of the stop in the trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Přízak, Frazová, Sprateká.
Of course, the trolleybus was somewhat louder, so reporting by a male voice was somewhat less understandable than when the stops were speaking by a female voice.
Women's voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic it is better recognizable than the deeper male voice.
The DPMB argues that these voters chose their own passengers - I don't know, who didn't ask me, but they certainly chose from the studio recordings made in total silence, which of course sounded quite different from that of the bus engine.
I've been living in Brno for a couple of decades, so I know the correct names of all these stops to remember, so I don't need this report, but foreigners who don't recognize in Brno and for which these reports are intended in particular can be confused and can say to the final ones, where they failed, that the stop they were supposed to make was not reported at all.
Perhaps this choice of voters - but better again of voters - should be made again, and this time a colored with normal traffic noise and engine noise, in which the conch of the player on the bus almost disappears.
In order not to continue to listen to the names of the stations of Water Herspice, Smyrus, or Ponorna in the winding country I crossed into in Komáro.
I guess my old ear didn't get worse all of a sudden during the only day that the speaker changed his arrest.
I understood that report pretty well before that day.
Good morning, Chief's colleague.
From the tape recorders.
Today, few know what the largest and wisest governments of the parties have been called complex checks.
I let myself remember that.
The bus was late.
I ran into the dispatch office at a time when radio said it was just seven hours.
"You're lucky you didn't get hurt with your partner, came a minute before you, and it doesn't seem like he's in the mood," the dispatcher noted, while I was in the book of revenue.
Thank you. I'll take a look.
Write me that I'm going after the crossroads on a little mechanization check.
It's not going to work. It's a check today.
They're all out of this shit when they're scared.
What's this about?
"But you'll see," said the dispatcher.
You'll be next.
I ran for a walk.
Then the chief's door opened and the chief appeared.
Stirred, stone-faced, perfectly falling flat.
"Good morning, Mr. Chief," I greeted him politely and quickly turned on two buttons of the same coat of mail.
"Good morning," she said, and I quickly ran to the second floor without realizing the cold, vicious tone the old one answered.
"You're playing," I was greeted by the engineer Eva, the elderly lady I really appreciated.
I think she was even the bosses before her companions sat down.
There's checks, and you're gonna get there.
How many times have I asked what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about them.
They've been there once in three years, they all have to be there, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
But I'll see.
I pulled out a folder with periodic reports and then the phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me immediately," the chief called out.
What's he up to?
Now we met and nothing ..." I missed, but no one answered me, everyone with their thoughts.
"Good day, comrade Chief, I came to your order," I reported, barely entered the Chief's office.
The chief was sitting behind the writing table and looking at some tape.
"A fellow mechanic," he said after a moment without lifting his head and still carefully looking at the record, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the register on the table, washed himself in the washroom, and rolled himself up against me with an ordinary, unpleasant, evil, psychedeous look.
I've been through.
What's going on?
Even yesterday, he commended me for having worked very well in those few months and for being very happy with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the van at a distance.
What about this?
I realize you're a track distance technique, and that's why you have to behave.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I hesitated that I used such a greeting from childhood, that I was so raised and that I didn't see anything wrong with it.
It was like a red dragon on a croc.
"You're on a socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honour of work," said a retired chief.
Besides, you're still messing with the seniors.
One time you'll say "sir" and the other again "sad".
But I'm not a Mr. Chief for you, but I'm a fellow Chief.
The alternates are associates of the alternates, the top trammasters are companions of the top trammasters!
Remember that kindly!
I'm sorry, sir... my colleague, the chief, but... but I greeted you with the usual civil greetings.
There's nothing wrong with it... and it's an honor to work, or to have a partner... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your privilege that you're not on the side," said the chief, who calmed down a little.
But it's still going to be.
Anyway, remember that you don't have the chair on top of your pension.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his advantage, it didn't look good with the person in question.
For a while, he gave me a cold, gray look, and I was looking for the words that I would answer.
I was also concerned about his increased fatting.
He was only a few years older and played for god, actually a fellow god.
The animal, the inflated, the authoritarian, the arrogant, as it was right now.
He's been stabbed by everyone.
Wake up, he's a chief.
Actually, not all of them, the president of the party organization, like all the parties, but also the non-citizens, were kicking.
But the chief was a lot of people, especially those with whom he could apply his superiority.
Right now, he's got me as a full-blown bitch.
I've been thinking about shit and it's been a long time before I shot it in his face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the trunk of the potato, so I could continue to do the law enforcement.
What would I use two kids for?
And that's a broken bar!
I was wrong, but I was in control.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all you can do so far," said the chief auditor and began to look carefully again at the tape he had previously in his hand.
They called me in half a dozen.
Everyone in the office was already there and asked questions about what and how, they answered that it was going to be good.
Only Jožin succinctly explained how his habit was that all of us can't get away with it because he would have to work together with his own faithful leaders, and that's not a threat.
The word "judgment" was highlighted, but it was as if he knew what the old man had set me up for this morning.
There was a nice meeting in the Chief's office.
The Association of Chiefs at their writing table and at the long advisory table of other Associations who were to decide on my official stay or not.
Kádrávák, president of the ROH, personal recorder, Special Rapporteur, something in a way contradicts the war, and the place, my boss.
And also the most important person, president of the party organization.
I knew him from the strike.
It's just a regular track worker, he's squeezing the stove, or he's seen throwing a hammer.
But also an ex-guard.
It was heard that there was no joke about him this time, like a beautiful beast.
Bad language says the school went out in the seventh grade, didn't learn anything, didn't have anything.
And when the crime was canceled, he ended up at the top of the potato.
But my partner, yeah, my partner was stoned!
The chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little baby baby in my neck with an inconspicuous scarf.
The mayor read out the opinion of the Civil Committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two kids and so on and so on.
So far it's been good, I've thought about it, and I've had a little better breath.
Then we're gonna have a review from the street organization.
He copied the civil committee's judgment, if both of them were to write the same person.
But then it came!
Parents of long-term members of the party refused to submit to the inspection committee and subsequently stepped out of the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The cadre noticed and stopped reading.
The chief ordered him to continue.
It's been worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee and there I was obtained as a candidate for the party.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and married, except for the National Committee, I also had a church.
I've let the party's trust down in the worst way.
That's why I was cut off from among her candidates.
But that's enough!
I had both children baptized, and even when Mom died, I had a church funeral, although it was a former party member.
By doing so, I reveal a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the cadre read, only the beating of the chief's seatbelt to the table interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone looked at me clearly, and I wanted to be far away.
And then I kept saying, "Counsels - bullies, communists - bullies." What did I get for?
Why didn't I stay with the cowards?
I could've fixed the escapes without any fucking check.
But now?
The career of the deputy officer took her place before she started.
Go back to the barn?
I don't think that's going to work. I'm sure the chief will be out for an hour.
"Counsel, how did you check out the counsel discussed here?" interrupted the quiet chief with a question on the cadre.
Well, according to the previous employment review.
Do you have him here?
It was obviously not overtime.
On the sidewalks, he's snooping nervously as if he's been checked.
He hollered and gave the chief some paper.
"No," said the chief with a sign of curiosity, which was often the premonition of storms.
At first glance, he studied industry, worked as a temporary worker, met the standard on an average of one hundred and twenty percent.
But it's important.
Where did you get that judgment, mate?" he turned again to the cadre who felt that it was beginning to turn against him and that very soon he would not even have to be a cadre.
This is where my partner gave it to me when she got back.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came up to us, he went to the corner of the cottage," said the cadre.
And there's no warrants, and he was like the other guy, so I put him in the file.
"So when you entered the technical function, this paper car was enough," said the chief.
The cadre was nervous and had no answer.
"It's okay, we'll talk about it later," he closed the matter with the chief and the cadron was obviously relieved.
For the time being, it's settled.
"So what's wrong with you guys?" the chief came back to me.
All of a sudden, it's over!
In my eyes it's dark, it's hot.
He followed up on the charges and charges, and I knew that I was the most resistant creature in the world that deserves no less mercy.
That by substantiating the incomplete judgment, I failed to understand why the judgment was incomplete when I received it from the copper in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist living who, during the construction of real socialism, supports the streams of religious darkness, ba, even participates in them.
That there was a lot of things I've done, or maybe I'm still doing, and I've been praying for it to be over.
I don't care.
I don't care if I get out of the mechanic's office.
I don't care if they take my potato.
It's work for honest and decent people, not for the enemies of the people I was in the eyes of the chief's companion.
"That would be enough, co-sponsored by the chief," the president of the party suddenly called and severely interrupted the Levites.
This is where my partner made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he just did the stupid thing!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, fellow chief!
What could be worse for a young man than if we shut the door for a while!
To reopen him, he will have to prove that he has changed that he is worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it get in him?
Is he so summarised or did he pick up a phrase from party trainings and meetings?
That is why this young fellow must also be given a chance!
The chance to prove he's changed.
And who's supposed to give it to him if it's not you, comrade chief?
It's your duty for this young man, the truth, to support his efforts to make amends!
It's your civic duty that no one's gonna get rid of you!
Actually, it's a party duty for all of us, too.
Here's where the partner has to see that the party hasn't forgotten him.
That not only does he punish as a loving mother, but he also loves her.
When the president's finished, no one's even heard.
No one's been waiting for this turn of events.
At least me.
"I fully agree with you, my fellow president," the chief of police urged him to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me make a deal, you'd hear that I'd be heading to that conclusion.
They all agreed to their heads, but it was obvious to them that they didn't believe his word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of the independent care rapporteur on basic funds," I cried back to the office and cried back.
Except for Eve's engineers, they were all at lunch.
The little ones listened to my thoughtless thought of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I was done, she asked if I could have some coffee.
Before she waited for the answer, she put water on the cooker and she was going to the torch.
Meanwhile, she talked about cadron practices.
Like one judgment, often full of praise, they give a person into the hand, and the other, where there is dirt, will send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was, but on the side of the potatoes, so the partners from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cadre?
He's just getting old where he'd eat or drink, and that's how it ended up.
"That one from the old shack," she said maliciously.
He certainly won't like it today.
Take care of him anyway, he's pretty vengeful.
What about the party president?
In fact, a far worse leader, no human being.
It's a zero from a potato that's got a lot of power.
The coffee water started to boil, and the office filled the smell of freshly baked coffee.
I threw into a cane of sugar, and the cane mixed a hot drug.
I hope I'm from the worst outside.
Now it's not gonna work out for me, and the next check is in three years.
Anyway, I don't think I'm gonna forget about it tonight.

The symbol of the village is alive.
The windshield over Chlum is turning again after years.
It's visible far away, because it's located 15 meters high.
People from a wide area call him "the wind on Chlum."
For the population of 150, it became even one of the elements of the general mark, which the world gained in 2010 the opportunity to strike the relatives.
"We then asked for a sign and the wind on the sign, of course we wanted to have, everyone knows it," observed mayor Jiří Masehek.
Chlumbian wind pump is a local technical memory.
It's a little bit of a memento of the present: it reminds us of the time when these people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum was rare in the last century.
By 1910, it was decided by the clever representatives for solutions, which were up to half the 1980s.
In the village, at the turn of the Czech Republic, they had seven meters of deep cold.
Three years later, they added another metal construction with a wind pump, which was pumped into the tank at the highest point of the village near the church.
"The building was carried out by Antonín Kunc of Hranic at the cost of 2,400 kroner," says the monumental inscription on the ground floor for the construction of the barn.
After several repairs and windfalls, it was due in 1971.
Then, on May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the battle began to be written about water: that day he began serving a new water supply in Chlum.
The wind pump has already remained only a non-functional general symbol and this is a rarity.
The Dominant was promoted at the birth this year.
Until 2008, Chlumští decided to repair and restore the wind cycle.
They let them produce a replica of the original wheel - reduced by an average of half a metre.
The wheel was planted on the roof, but it had to be taken down the same year.
The replica producer did not choose the suitable material and the wheel should not be affected by the wind pipes.
Then the Chlumsian Dominant rested under the roof for several years.
However, from June this year, the wheel on the high roof is turning again.
On the occasion of the strike of the parents, the occupier let the replica of the wheel be adjusted and again placed it on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws useful water from the cold only to the paralytic blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected him because there was little water in the cold.
It was at least empty.
"In the autumn, then, we will re-connect the wind wheel from the pump in the bag," explained Mayor Mask.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind bike has reached the general mark, but it is the only one of these species throughout the Highlands.
A similar feature in the brand is the honor of local technical monuments such as Chvalkovic and Green Mountains in Vyškovsk, Kuželová in Hodoninsk, Partutovici in Peruvian or Police in Vsetinsk.
Nothing bad, but I don't know Lafata, she confessed to the support of Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the victory against Slavia very well, and my goal, like all in my career," 34-year-old Goian laughed at a press conference.
This time George Hagi trained us, it was a shame we lost.
I hope I'm going to target Sparta now.
Just because we don't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who won 60 matches for Romanian representation, is a key supporter of the Greek team.
As a flag, he'll face the attacks of Spartan offensives.
A few thousand people come, no hell, says about the Greek battle of Spartan Hybsh.
And in part he knows what can be expected of him on Thursday night.
I know Fataie, who played in the Romanian Astro with my brother Lucian.
At that time, I saw all their fights.
I know he's a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta, too, said Goian.
The other footballers of the Prague club didn't mention, so the direct question came, if he knew David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and looked at Czech journalists with a slightly calculated view.
"Why are you asking me about this?"
After a moment of silence, he let it go.
We saw some videos, and I noticed Sparta is playing a lot of teams.
He's got really good players.
What about Lafata?
Nothing bad, but I don't know anyone but Fataie.
The bastards know very well about Goian.
"He has experience from larger clubs, it can be said that he holds the defense of Asteras, it's their game organizer," said Spartan assistant Stanislav Haykal.
Goian's got the best summers yet, but he can boast of a very interesting football life story.
He was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both of the Manchesterese United and City, from Steauy, but he joined the Italian Palermo, also playing for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a great team, regularly playing European Cups, pears about victory in the Czech League.
For me, he's a favorite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Just like Sparta, we're gonna try and win, Goian said.
I'm in a room with a Slovenian marketer Tomáš Koshýk, who is very excited about a Czech rival.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new seat should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading with the company's shares in the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have a group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken for the time being within the project are mainly legal and administrative and do not have a real impact on the event in society, says Daniel Buryš, the financial director of Kofola.
"In relation to the movement of the group's seat, shareholders consider the placement of shares in the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry into the Prague Stock Exchange, the company will complete a prospectus of the securities, which will be submitted at the earliest time by the Czech National Bank for approval.
The transfer of the holding seat and related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction by sharing only existing shareholders.
Therefore, no public registration or new investors will be offered in the context of this operation.
"A possible offer of action to new investors would be made - if the company were to hide and its shareholders would decide - later, either in 4th quarter 2015 or 1st quarter 2016," the company said.
In the past, the company has already stated that any tender for shares could consist of the issue of new shares or sales of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of the stock exchange in Warsaw.
The Czech TV objectivity test in information on the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the Czech media's reports on the refugee crisis.
This time broadcast of the main news report on Czech television.
And how did she manage?
When journalists at the Faculty of Journalism teach about how the media can manipulate reality, they can allow today's broadcast of the Czech TV Event.
The migration crisis was dedicated to about 80% of the news.
Until the first minute ČT informed of the riots on the Serbian-Madian border and the attacks of migrants on the policemen called them euphemistically, they were suffering - throwing stones and attacking them with point-of-points), the now more promulgative propaganda was already being used - consider the names of individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for non-profit organisations that are criticising the poor treatment of migrants.
Syrian children at the Czech School - the story of the integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Hurry not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Refugee Travel - ČT consistently uses the term runner or fugitive rather than migrants.
It is particularly contagious that ČT in illustrative photographs uses only photographs of small children and women.
However, in the same broadcast, it stated that 80% of migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: Most of the propaganda that does not have periods of communist agitation.
I have to say that as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I ever got into a panel apartment, I soon stopped being the only resident.
I've had fish moving in the sink.
Fishhouses, insects with a change imperfect, i.e., that don't produce a bunch of puppies and young people look like an adult, they're just tiny and they're growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't want them to be killed.
First hand and later chemical.
Socialist drugs on their disposal provided some blue crystals.
I think it was called Cyclon B.
Or something else?
But it's been eliminated successfully.
Later, I decided to do the same with Pharaoh.
A box with some juvenilizer that the ants brought into the nest and then he wouldn't allow the queen to generate a new offspring.
But I did.
As time went by, the wetness became the subject of my admiration, and I became more and more attached to the view that they had the same right to life as we do.
In addition, I have learned from my life that interference with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace another.
The truth is, I don't think I'd be able to make it worse by killing them.
In the new dwelling, we agreed with our partner that if we don't get the fish to lie on our throat, let the foxes eat the lost skin, some of the invisible breeds and so on.
Their peaceful existence has been disrupted by spiders over time.
It was the usual type of passenger who lived on the roof for a long time.
We felt that he was living from occasional mosquitoes and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Because he lived with us for several years, we found that he was living mainly with fish and that he was probably keeping their numbers in a profitable state of count.
We have found that she is a female by means of a confidential regular contact with each need.
Because we've been witnesses of romantic agreements with a partner about a third less, how carefully he is on the spider's fibers, so he doesn't eat before he reaches the claimed coupling.
It took about three days for them not to move or respond to our controls.
Under the Western Mass, where loving toys were played, we later found the remains of the dried female next to the female.
Then the spider didn't even move for weeks.
When we thought it was already behind us, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging around her.
They're gone soon.
They were bitten by their mother, they were bitten by something else.
Even a female disappeared after a week.
If she left or fell asleep, we don't know, but after two months, she showed up on the roof again.
The truth is, a little bit smaller, probably the daughter of the toilet cook.
For some time from the ceiling, she carefully observed our behavior and, by moving under the western mass, assessed our non-attackness as a friendship.
The number of fish in some way decreased again, and the spider quietly watched its usual activities to ensure food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed for a year.
Our daughter, in the meantime, grew up when using the nightstand was already a shame.
We've been tolerating it so far, but we've already taken care of his eternal content.
We've been pushing her all the more to use the bathroom.
However, for the purpose of maintaining her habit, she found an excuse in that spider she saw very well when she drowned.
Our talk about seeing spiders, happiness in the house didn't take away at all.
With tears and tears, she forced her nightlife.
There wasn't any leftovers.
There was a time when the spider had to report in the interest of the daughter's developmental movement.
It was on me.
He was taken to the glass and shown through the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I fought with him like a friend, but after so long a combination I felt as ugly as throwing away a relative.
We assumed that fish would start to appear more often and multiply by geometric order.
The world's weird, week, two, none of us showed up there.
I started speculating about the reason.
I was wondering if there was a spider in there, like ants, that wasn't as good as we thought it would be in the middle of the bathroom.
Then the first pieces of the middle size appeared, and they're already intertwined.
I had to invent another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their connection to the spider had to have a reason for not seeing him hiding somewhere else and threatening them anywhere.
Or maybe they had some telepathic connection with their transmitter and his rapid disappearance caused some terrible reaction.
You're saying that I'm not making any illusions about their appearance.
There was some light of brightness, but that they would react to shaking hands or moving fast, not.
My daughter's going to the bathroom all the time.
I think she forgot about the night.
There's nothing left but to attract some spider again.
I'm sending my wishes to the ether, and I hope they didn't come back to me after the execution.
Otherwise we'd have to use that B cycle.
The waste of Albert Einstein's expressions that enriched the world.
The judgments of a brilliant scientist of the past century are likely to never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to sink into everything so deep that the eruption was always an amazing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
The people were particularly aware of their special and general theory of relativity, which has so far best described the universe in its gigantic proportion.
It is also not possible to mention its explanation of the photo-effect or idea of the quantification of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity are for so many, that for closer knowledge, they prefer to choose easy ways.
It's not easy, though.
However, it would not be Albert Einstein if he did not find this in a perfectly simple form of explanation: the hour near your lover seems to be a minute; the minute in a hot oven seems to be an hour - and that is relative.
I've allowed myself from his entire fleet of famous quotations to choose these ten that have literally taken me.
intelligent people are trying to solve problems, genius is trying not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human nonsense.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of trials can ever prove that I was right.
But the only thing that can ever prove I was wrong.
But it's a sad period when it's easier to break atoms than to destroy prejudices.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in mind, what does the empty table then reflect?
I don't know what he's going to fight in World War III, but in that fourth, it's gonna be bricks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing a little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with the problem that my life would depend on, I'd spend 40 minutes of his study, 15 minutes of his analysis and 5 minutes of his solution.
In the world the hardest thing to understand income tax.
To conclude, I can't forgive not to mention Einstein's formula in the definition of success: If we take A for success, the pattern: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to hold the tongue for teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in Zlinsk are waiting for changes of 1.5 billion.
"It is a success when we consider that all four of them are kept in black numbers this whole year," noted happily Heitman Stanislav Mishak.
The total profit of the regional facilities is now about 32 million crowns.
The share is mainly higher than the premiums that are equally favourable for this year.
And this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kroméríža, Vsetina, Uherský Hradiští and Zlina, this is the result of the climb to the buildings that will total almost 1.5 billion crowns.
The long time we bought the main equipment was over.
Now we have to start building new buildings because without them, the top health cannot be done, he has justified plans for the regional health facility Lubomír Nečas.
She's looking forward to the changes in all the hospitals.
The construction workers are coming to the hospital next year.
There are now suppliers of a new internal pavilion for nearly 300 million crowns.
In Kroméríža, they have a planned port of dialysis.
The Uhersk Shradska wants to build a new home for about 200 million open-ended pavilion this year.
And the sick Bata's hospital is waiting for a long-standing construction of a new central income and interior that will need three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, this is the main and often biggest change in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," said Veera Prousková, the director of the hospital, for example.
Five-storey buildings are to be ready in about two years and offer comfortable equipment for internal and neurological, dialysis, new ambulance, bed and intensive care unit.
Greater comfort for patients.
Changes that are particularly familiar to patients will affect all regions.
For example, new buildings replace those in which many patients are in one room, need only one toilet on the floor, the beds are inconclusive, the windows are closed, and the doctors do not have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our interior was built fifty years ago and now it's at the edge of its life," said the director of the criminal hospital Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected to emergency income.
Doctors and patients will have all emergency departments in one place, in addition to in new spaces.
The same model already has from half the Uher Shrine.
The central income is already standing, and he'll be in the interior within three years.
"We will pay the building from credit and in part from our own resources," explained Peter Sladek.
This hospital can afford its own funding as the only one in the country.
The profit is still the highest, and it didn't even get to the loss two years ago, when the illustrative hospital was facing almost two hundred million losses.
"We have good insurance contracts, excellent performance, we raise revenues and effectively manage the costs in the whole hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdak, who has a care economy.
Improvements are also expected in patients at a cross-sectional hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years it will go to repair, new tools and reconstructions up to half a billion crowns.
As soon as this year the recovery of the catch station will begin, the construction of dialysis will begin, if necessary, for the new magnetic resonance.

No one explained to me how I should keep acceptable refugees in the country if they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Minister of Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains to his European colleagues that the other countries of the Czech Republic are pressuring them to accept quotas for the redeployment of refugees, but refuse any discussion.
It also suggests that no one has explained to him yet how to keep assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us.
"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe in more detail the position you have come to meet with in-house ministers and abroad of the European Union?
We don't agree with mandatory quotas like a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants as salt or flour.
They're living beings who have some vision, some direction, some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we could keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistribution.
We can't imagine.
We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. places of registration, border protection, camps outside Europe, the trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we say this is the way.
But to say that the quotas will solve everything?
We've solved forty thousand recently, now it's one hundred twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep those people in this area?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost nobody wants us. We just don't know how to keep them here.
There are other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as their destination, get asylum from us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, that is, Syria and other countries, is only near zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't even want to come to us, but fifteen hundred people are already committed.
Wouldn't it be possible to take them this way more?
We made a commitment to accept 1500 people, but on condition.
We said functional hotspots, border guards, military operations.
Even in the 1500s, there will be 1,100 people with whom we can deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come into our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way we've caught them.
It is a big question, and we will discuss it with Europe if we can hold back people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, if necessary in Hungary.
Because Europe behaves in such a way that if they have registration, they cannot be detained.
That means they come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, it can happen that we will not stay in the territory of the Czech Republic even those 1100 and they will go back to Germany when they arrive.
If we can keep them during the asylum procedure, we will deal with them in the asylum procedure.
If this is done by citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98% of European statistics receive international protection.
Then they will get the documents that will allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end up again in the target countries.
Then there are four hundred people who will move.
This is the second project that is currently under way, and we have just moved on to debate with the churches on the possibility that they could help them find employment, accommodation and so on.
But it's a very long race.
You said the other states were not willing to discuss with us at the ministerial meeting.
But is it not that the Czech Republic only refuses quotas, but does it offer no solidarity step that would unlock the discussion?
And what exactly do you think this is supposed to be a solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany is encouraged that all migrants from Syria can access them, the report will spread in hours throughout all camps throughout Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's another migration wave that's heading to Germany because they just don't want us.
We think that the road is protected from external borders - just those migration waves to repair, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
Just to let them know they don't have a chance.
Last year alone, 50 thousand Kosovos arrived in Germany.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including police, courts, state representations.
If we managed to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to economic needs, then those fifty percent of what social systems spend on them today could be refugees.
On the contrary, on the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day was twelve.
Where is it supposed to come to increase border controls?
We were afraid of catching hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred free seats in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we're holding will be returning to Austria within seven days.
We're doing it by default.
They're the only people who take us with them, and it's complicated with Hungary and the Greeks - it's a completely unnecessary story.
So where's the breaking point?
Should it be a thousand a day?
I think it's supposed to be a couple hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days a day, we're exhausted of our capacity so that there's going to be a crisis plan.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately call the extraordinary government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're on the phone several times a day.
If the situation arises, the government may de facto sit immediately and decide by a single resolution to strengthen the police on the army, let's give it to the customs administration, if any, on the prison service.
The country variant is an exceptional state that has now been declared by Hungary in some places?
I don't think it can go this far.
Be aware that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have only the Schengen border and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have happened in order for this to happen in the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread the terrible information.
All the information we have, from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, is more than suggesting that Hungarians are trying to withdraw the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then be a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would have touched it very badly, almost at all.
Slavia has paid a large part of the debt for the last minute.
It's trying to prevent a failure.
Soccer Slavia paid off her debts.
The footballers also got their money.
Football Slavia stood on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings before the court.
Nearly three months after about 20 million crowns submitted a proposal to Online Services from Pacific Samoa.
The legal representative of Slavie Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzlov for several hours that he was not supposed to report a fall over Slavia.
And it has to be said that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week, the new owner of Slavie became a large Chinese industrial and investment group of CEFC and also a Czech billionaire Jiří Šimaná.
Obviously from the new owners to the club, the money's up, and that's for the last minute.
This also proves that Slovenia's statement before Tuesday's trial - the Supreme Club on Monday, just the day before the trial, sent out tens of millions of crowns.
"All was replaced between 11 September and 15 September," said legal representative Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
For example, the Slovenian representative, Milan Ivan, or the Czech guardian, Mari Lick.
Slavia also paid agent Alexander Losenick's fee.
On Friday, the club also paid the debt fees of the city part of Prague 10.
Part of the insolvency dispute thus remains de facto only the claims that Slovenia is challenging.
Either by the club the commitments have not at all arisen or they are dealt with by the courts.
However, in the event of a loss of these disputes, we are prepared to pay the amount.
"We have the necessary funds on our bank account, which we can report with the statement from the account," said Mládková lawyer.
"All that has been after the due date has been replaced," the Mładkova said and added that the unresolved are only unpaid or irrevocable obligations.
It is also true that the judge will not decide in the next few days and will continue the proceedings.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid the debts.
Next comes the evaluation of all the evidence.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The judge ordered the continuation of the proceedings on the third November.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but in writing after it.

FastMig X is the newest generation of inverter-swift sources.
The combination of peak technologies, hardware and software equipment integrated into the modular design brings benefits and rapid return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final composition is always configured according to customer requirements.
And anything, from the roasting of construction steel after the roasting of special alloys, as well as from the roasting of rough materials after the roasting of thin sheets, from the application in the workshops to the roasting in the shipyards.
The incredible amount of welding curves, simple setting and the expansion of the welding source enables a rapid response to change of requirements, leading to a reduction of the simples, to the need for a change of source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding by the top-point welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and the quality of welding.
Stop wasting time and do not waste material or fix faulty issues.
It is provided with flexibility, is less simple, more messy and higher profit.
It's this year's news that had a premiere in Nitra, where she also got gold medals.
We are very much concerned about these trends because they confirm the product's exceptionality.
The front world manufacturers can boast similar systems, but thanks to differences in software and parameters, FastMig X belongs to the world's tip.
For the interested parties, the additional time limits for moving around three weeks are also pleasant.
In the Czech Republic, we have already linked the first contacts that will certainly continue to expand after the Bernese fair.

It went to build a blank so it wouldn't fail.
But it would be half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
The blank went even safer, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex was possible to build in such a way that there were no two land failures in the Prague Stromovce, the production director of Satra, who is the main projector of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovic.
He said it on Wednesday afternoon at a press tour of the tunnel.
But he thinks it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel went down safer, but costs grew exponentially," Butovic said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovce were the same all the time, yet the country has only dropped a few steps from the place from which it started to develop a safer and more careful method.
"If the measure were used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," Butovic said.
Blanka tunnel fell three times during the building.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovce, in 2010 the soil fell to the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Bělhlav, the tunnel is too expensive, the weekly Euro said.
The construction was originally intended to amount to SEK 17 billion.
When we add the VAT that came out twice during the construction period, you have eleven billion.
When technology, land purchases and engineering activities, valuations and similar items are involved, it's 29 billion, which is not from 37 again to so far, Bélohlav said.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get a new iPhone operating system with a new Apple update
The new operating system can be requested in Settings by clicking on the "General" tab and selecting "Software Update" (upgrading software).
When ready, your phone will offer you the possibility to download and then install it.
Some users have encountered the problem after installation, specifically with the error message "updating the software failed".
One of the solutions to this problem is to wait until it gets interested in updating, or try it over iTunes.
The phone will keep you up to date.
And this includes the need to uninstall applications for site release - however, it will not be necessary because Apple has reduced the update and also facilitated the whole process thanks to the use of a special tool that the user will propose applications for removal and re-installation after the update has been completed.
Make sure your phone is busy before you start updating.
If the battery is low, Apple will not allow the update because interrupting the process might cause the update to fail.
Further reports: iOS 9 release has not been delayed despite the WatchOS retention; iOS 9 review; exciting updating of the new version of the operating system; iOS9: how to prepare for the release of a new operating system for iPhone
Make sure that you have passed our list of things to do before updating that you try and to prevent or protect yourself from. iOS 9 represents new functions, including even smarter personal assistants and a large scale of creative functions for iPad, as well as many fees to speed up and repair the operating system.
Profits FedExu mixed, reduced fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported unsatisfied results in the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecast of annual profits due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the land division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers.
The company's share decreased by about 2.5 per cent in the pre-market trade 45 minutes before the middle opening.
FedEx states that it expects a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which means a decrease of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The reduced view comes despite the increase in interest rates on average of 4.9%, which appears in January. 4, and higher supplements for the land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase profit against the previous year due to costs reduction, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
The chairman of the delegation and the Director-General of Fred Smith said that the company "preached a firm performance despite the expected economic conditions, especially in the processing industry and global trade."
The holiday rental plans were announced the day after the rival company UPS stated that the plan is to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, which is probably the same as last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx won $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
Profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
Markets grew by 5 per cent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts from Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been hit by a decrease in priority international shipping, which has caused revenue in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But boom online shopping boosted the results of the FedEx Earth unit.
In the last quarter, land income grew by 29 per cent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while profits decreased in the freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In the pre-trade trade about an hour before the opening of the FedEx share fell by $3.85, or by 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decrease of 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent under the June 11 record.
At its most unexpected meeting over the years, the Federal Reserve Lawyer spends two days this week at 27 feet of the long Honduras mahogany table and will decide whether it is time to increase the key interest rate after almost ten years.
Depending on them at one end of the central bank’s ornamentation, the two-storey meeting room will be painted by the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to give economic interests to the people above all others.
The Central Bank has a double charge from Congress: maximising American employment and maintaining this price stability.
But since the Great Reception, representatives of Fed have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third functional period: financial stability.
And this third functional period could be an X-factor too close to the foreseeable decision to be announced on Thursday whether the American economy is ready to be set off at the end of 2008 in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates.
Although most data show strong growth in the economy, recent turbulence in world financial markets could already scare the careful Fed by adding to the instability by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - and even more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour and inflation market will first of all be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for a gap to not raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient reason to wait forward," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which is the cause of nervousness in financial markets.
About half of the economists recently questioned by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to hold back the issue, with the key indicator only about 30% of the chance to increase.
This would indicate a decrease in the stock market in case the Fed increases interest rates, only if the policy declines negatively by promising that further increase will be ignored.
On Tuesday, Dow Jones' industrial average jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The meeting was launched with the expectation that the Fed policy will hold interest this week in peace, says John Lonski, the leading economist in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed now raised interest rates," he said.
If the Fed politicians did so, "they would have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold their hands on financial markets so that they wouldn't panic."
Other experts argued that the increase in interest rates would calm down financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Only a few months ago it seemed that the Fed was on a good track to increase the rate of 0.25 percentage points this month, the first step in slowing up the currency conditions that would confirm the strength of economic recovery in the USA.
Yellen said that over the spring and early summer, he expects an increase in interest rates this year and through complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market saw strong growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, which is lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wages have shown signs of rising.
And even though inflation continues to run under the annual central bank target of 2%, Fed's policy states that the temporary effect of oil prices was significantly lower.
The economy "can be balanced with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the leading economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets all over the world began to decline at the end of last month after China was devaluing its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones fell by up to 16% below its record value in May when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would slow down global growth.
The market was somewhat reflected this month, and Dow is now losing only about 10% of the May maximum.
To the political factors of Fed, the unrest on the market adds a complex calculation when the interest rate increases.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be an improvement at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, head of UCLA Research Officer Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed.
Now he predicts that they wait at least a month to get better control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China," said Oliner.
The health situation of the global economy is not one of the main interests of Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, Fed has become the world's currency authority.
The impact of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The only sign of then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "take advantage" of their monetary expansion on the market was to launch cracks around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interlinked, representatives of Fed are expected to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to deal with other central bankers and experts so that they can better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, the head of the global strategy for wealth-management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Laker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "The Fed has a history of overcrowded movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic foundations."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Policy Committee who was voting on an increase in interest rates, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during the three sessions "I despite limited identifiable effects on growth in the USA," Laker said.
About a year later, representatives of Fed turned these shirts.
The Fed should give priority to concerns about financial stability only during the great crisis, as was the market collapse in 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting committee.
The latest wave is not even approaching this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of growing interest because markets have broken down," said Posen, President of the Institute for the International Economy Peterson.
The Federal Reserve System Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in the Chinese quarter.
Yes, Chinese district
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells for the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese district, not a Thai district.
The market/store is the only contact place that offers an overwhelming range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian cuisine, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
Even car parts are available if you need some motor oil.
The deal is massive and will take you over an hour before you cross all the streets.
If you have any of this hunger shopping, go to the food in LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal store (good, cheap) is close to registers and has different pick-up places.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and many items are sold in large.
Among the fresh products are special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The mass expansion is great, for example, fish - employees behind your desk wash and shave it, even if you want it,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezing section where you will find frozen leaves, bitter melon and gallangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and yellow, pork stomach, balls, regional sausages, free-sale semi-trailers and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also private families and individuals.
The broad streets come out to meet shopping cars and high-speed cars.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the treasure stand.
Where is it located: Shop is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by suburbs of the Chinese district and centers - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot that shares with other shops and restaurants.
While shopping can be contained, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the roads stays with the old ones.
The acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected.
The chosen sections of the motorways will not be able to increase the maximum permitted speed under favourable conditions up to 150 km/h.
On Tuesday, Snymovna decided to join the Senate's amending proposal, which rejected the increase in speed.
The new Land Communications Act is now heading towards the president.
By the end of April, President Milos Zeman had said that the law would have vetted the speed of the footpaths.
At the same time, the Minister of Transport Dan Çok (for the UN), according to which the Czech road network has not yet been built at such a speed.
He supported the Senate version of the law on Tuesday before the MP.
The approved novelty will now be able, in accordance with the original government proposal, to increase the speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first class roads, in particular four routes.
The House first extended this possibility even to the roads that could be driven at the chosen speeds up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
The messengers have now come to his proposal.
The senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport, also requested that the traffic police have the last word in the local communications that the local authorities are taking care of.
The Senate version approved by the House also includes that the sewerage, plumbing or public lighting cables may be stored below the surface of the vehicles.
This would save the city for the land's ransom.
The municipality should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
Novela is also intended to help improve road safety and to facilitate public transport by towed vehicles to which the owner does not apply.
A new municipality could sell withdrawn vehicles which are not registered within a six-month period following the notification of the withdrawal of their owners.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight transport across their territories on the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of torture and for shipping companies.
They also move the possibility of introducing electronic road signs instead of today's papers, which will be used even after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The oral expression comes before the court.
He's 10 years in danger of being greeted by the public.
The case concerns the alleged welcome project.
The police wanted to complain in this case, and Ms. Zuzan Kailov (CSSD), but she did not give it up.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both are threatened by imprisonment for up to ten years.
The main estimate is still planned for two October days.
According to state representative Mandík and Macík, at least one million crowns have been damaged, resulting from the prosecution.
The complaint is based on a knowledge assessment.
Former members of the city's management, according to the plaintiff, wrongly made it possible to obtain the property benefits of the company which organised the welcoming of the public.
Mandík, according to the then chief of the judicial committee for urban services, education and culture, filed a complaint to refer to five companies in the selection procedure.
When another company that offered the lowest price applied to the competition, the councillor suspended the competition.
The order was then to entrust the city to the administrator and only the company Darothore, which then awarded the city council the order.
The city paid at least a million extras.
Both charges were directed to ensure that Darothore was awarded a public order for the organisation of the events Welcome to the towns in Ústí nad Labe in the long term and acted in coordination at least in breach of the requirement to treat the care of the proper economic operator, the State representative writes.
At the same time, he considered that Darothore subsequently calculated Ústí nad Labem to carry out the welcome of the citizens of the price, which would, contrary to the real value of the services actually provided, be disproportionately elevated.
In three years, the company had invested more than five million crowns, according to the project.
Finally, the city paid only one portion, about 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid was estimated to be at least one million crowns.
The mandik has already refused any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this built-in cause, the former prime minister said that under his leadership, the city was just linked to a similar project from last year.
From 2008 to 2010, the event was provided by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, the same money," Mandík added.
The criminals initially wanted to accuse Ms. Kaill, who was also a member of the City Council.
But she didn't give it up to fight.
Criminals have therefore postponed her case, but they count on Kaill's charge after her mandate is over.
The welcome of the townspeople was a social action that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
The Hungarian police reportedly left a dog on the run.
Then the reporters took the tape.
The Hungarian police, on the border with Serbia, briefly detained the AP's cameraman and forced him to take down the record that the police dog allegedly hit the refugee country.
The Hungarian government, however, has questioned this accusation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday night when the cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who across corn fields near the Hungarian town of Röszke crossed the border with Serbia.
Against the refugees, the police marched and one of them let a certain Syrian attack a dog with a basket on his boot.
The dog of the man who yelled "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," said the Muzi.
The one Muzi's filming everything, he noticed one of the cops and didn't let him leave.
Then the journalist shouldn't have called his superior or his colleagues on the spot.
The Muzi police took him to a dark spot at the Refugee Registration Center and asked him to show them what he had been fed.
Then they ordered him to cut the record.
The museum thus lost the result of two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt at risk because there were dogs nearby.
The AP's agency sent a protest letter to the Hungarian government's spokesperson Zoltán Kovács.
The conduct of police officers in him was considered unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover the events without risking physical violence and not being afraid that the government would destroy legally acquired material.
Kovács, with an appeal to the Museum's police report, questioned the timing of the events.
He said the cops just wanted a reporter to show them whether they were on some footage they had the right to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him.
"The dogs can leap - they are trained to scare off and push a little fear, but certainly not attacked," Kovács says.
Unpredictable League of Masters.
Victory on City will push us, believes Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserve to lose," cried Manuel Pellegrini, a home-viewer of the City.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic game of the League of Masters.
Not one team created too many opportunities, but we had a ball on the sidewalks for a while.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just shot two beautiful goals," evaluated the Pellegrina match, whose team was incarcerating in the competition after 636 minutes.
The finalist of the last Juventus season was exactly the opposite before the mutual collision - after the first three rounds of the Italian league has what the defender of title only points and score 2:4 is up to the 16th place of the table.
And that's why turning to Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This victory will help us mentally, will motivate us," believes Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistances before the new year - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal.
In Manchester, he was represented by Pogba, Manzukić and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is very important, perhaps because of it we will find a victory wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half, we were better, especially in an aggressive phase.
This result is what my players deserve.
"Before our balancing goal we could have otherwise incassed at 0:2, but Gianlugi supported us," praised Allegri as a Buffon goalkeeper.
"We've burned several good odds," hated Yay Touro, the city's hostage.
We need to get out of the League of Experience Masters and next time try to get a better result.
Good-bye, Angelo. Good-bye, old German II.
Before we continue with the question of immigrants, we should realize that all the media cracking around is handled by professionals.
According to the media and also the sessor.
Let's stop for a second.
Today there are newspapers and media full of children who carry their parents on dusty trails of the Exodus.
And this causes a sense of guilt and compassion in a person - that is, in a European person.
Well, they don't just come here, desperate kids, notice on the pictures of ships coming to the Greek islands that the baby isn't so visible on them!
Well, we've been missing some of the last time from the TV pictures of a ship heading for Lampedus, fleeing the French border at Menton, where thousands of young men have beautiful walks.
Much of the young blacks.
And there are also missing images from Callais where these people are eating and black men are waiting to see if they can cross the tunnel under La Manche.
She probably doesn't feel it anymore.
Even those pictures of the primitive Christian Church of the Eritreans did not make the inhabitants of Europe a special impression.
Too much of that was running wrong.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it's kind of a secret that it's not only about unhappy children from Syria, but also about established - for older people: fashioned - young men.
The muscles that look like they just came out of some kind of fitness center.
It's just one personal experience.
This summer we lay on the private beach of the hotel on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus.
No matter how private she was, a large group of cars suddenly came to the beach.
But no hams.
And out of them came a young black man.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all dressed in brand clothes and shoes... in the hand, like, smartphones.
That it's a private beach, it's not interesting and the employees - Turks, Muslims! - they were obviously afraid.
They've planted all the beds.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and was just in the sea was sorry.
They were dressed like American rappers.
On the heads of a hat with a finger, white and colourful adidas on the legs.
Then they took the local beach bar and started growing.
They sat around the tables and sat next to the sitting breakfast and white guests at the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining room somewhere in peace.
The previous black people drank beer equal to a third - how in series from the USA?! - they threw empty bottles around them on the beach.
They kept screaming at each other.
It wasn't English, though.
Then they went to drink wine, even from the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in brand swimsuits, especially those young ladies - in the water they yelled and yelled, mothers with children and pensioners were terrified and in half an hour he was no longer on the beach or in the pool or a black guest.
Everyone's gone.
No matter whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about them.
The priest said to me in the evening, "Have you seen the gold they had on them?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had on his neck about 20 centimeters of solid gold cross.
And women were like gold.
"Are they drug addicts?" I asked.
"You've seen how they smell," said the waiter.
Drugs don't suck, they don't even live.
They're eating something else.
So it was clear what they were chewing.
But in June 2105, it wasn't so important to me.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
But secret services and top politicians should have known that first.
I don't think they'd know.
About 1.5 million immigrants were given to Europe at that time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today it has been shown that the European Union's main problem is that total-political-corrective policies, such as intellectual and linked lobbyist and economically important groups, have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its policies - today's well-known leading forces in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, as well as EU and television peaks, including ours.
For example, recent television images about the excited welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of pictures of Moscow's television from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sunflowers at the station, but mostly, ancient Germans, Muslims welcomed their compatriots.
For weeks they have been blabbling in reports on Czech TV, as Germans say, according to some research, almost all for the arrival of immigrants.
But who was only a few days in Germany knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, a famous public opinion research organised by ARD - Czech Association of Public Law Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept more refugees a week ago.
That's also what our TVs reported.
However, what happened the second day in Germany was that in the poll, 94.5% of Germans no longer wanted immigrants - 67,000 attended the polls.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, that is, five years ago, declared: "Our effort on multi-culture society has completely failed."
Then she said, "Germany gives up the fight for multicultural society."
"All efforts to achieve such coexistence have completely failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, it says there was no strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live with themselves without integration.
It's not a reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say we're just living happily by ourselves, failed this approach.
He was totally wrong.
But neither does Merkel have the strength to go against powerful Germany and Europe and, above all, against political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is rising rapidly.
Eurodemec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, Member of the SPD, the only one who allegedly does not have a degree in the Europarliament - yes, that is what Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play the supervisor in the concentrate for a minute - has already been presented as a vice-president.
It seems, in particular, that Germany has exceeded Rubikon.
Let us note that, to some extent, most European policies do not support these judgments, the citizens of the countries that have been victims of Nazism are terrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who's been trying, at least outside for years, to deal with their horrendous past of the aggressor and the killer of millions?
Are they right to say that in the soul of Germany the Devil is obsessed with aggression, superiority and violence?
Was the Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped all his power from trying to control the Grand Duchy all over Europe?
When did he say the big German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When she was suspended, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Great Germany, which led Germany and Europe to two wars, which amounted to millions of lives, probably returned in a different way.
After the Marxists tried to rule the state, for example with the Rote Army Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, for example, Germany was based on ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideas of Naziism, began to develop a new German ideology.
We'd say sunshine.
The German elites have long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, so they left all those fighters against the atom in peace, eager to find a paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi password Our forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people around the world who want to do something different and better, they are fully committed to the side of combatants against global warming, stop nuclear power stations, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called proalestin - and an anti-Slovenian flow that all Slovenians regard as a difficult verb - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after his parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the last years of Schulze and the German minorities show, openly threatening the disobedient eastern states, the idea of Germany's leader.
Which is necessary without apologizing.
Otherwise you're sorry!
And if we take it into account that immigrants are a very influential group of volunteers, we have what we have.
And it stands behind it as always capital, especially the German which it meets, and which is because Germany actually controls most of the states of Europe through banks and the Union.
The sunflower pseudovirus first led Germany into the suburbs of ecology and multiculturalism and brought them home today and will bring perhaps millions of Muslims.
Those who, the angry voices of the siren, attack the wall of reality soon, which Merkel doesn't want to see, and they start to storm.
Germany can only again threaten its neighbours by force; again part of its inhabitants - but as it seems, the smaller part - can be ideologically depleted, but ultimately it is a reality as always achieved.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim shelters are already burning.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the arrival of Islamists explode?
Will Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time come to their aid, but certainly not assimilating to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, coming Islamists and Germans, who follow the fear of Islamizing their country?
What will he do with the Germans, and even with Germany, when the people who are going to protest publicly and openly against the new Euro-superman Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict that led to the support of solar ideologies in Europe, i.e. ideologies of elite and in principle totalitarian, and their uninhabited banks, is growing.
And because of the unbridled conduct towards disobedient democratic Germans and all subterfuge and insubordinate Eastern neighbours, it is not possible to do so well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of intruders is to scare them to death.
It's just that you're stuck, and you're stuck in a way that doesn't just have to get up.
The living head will set you up and set you fast, and walk away on the road (which will start more) of an invincible salesman and a lively thirst.
Maybe it's too bad that the speaker's whack can't really handle it.
And we'd have a lot of fuss and junk.
Oxalis corniculata (Oxalis corniculata).
A small flower that tolerates the dry environment.
And that's how it's located between the outdoor tiles near my apartment.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which is one of the expansional flowers, but apparently creates a good impression regarding flowering.
It's between the outdoor tiles.
She's unquestionable. She's in our garden.
She likes a dry environment, she's easily adaptable, modest and uncompromising.
They're making sheets of chaotic composition, but they're worth watching and taking pictures.
In short view there is just the beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with the vial accompanying.
Brazilian Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes healthy diet during breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS came in a shocking way to try to provide women with knowledge of the importance of good food by using images of children from the breast painted with an image of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that deliver to infants all the animals they need to create a strong immune system.
Due to the overload of energy requirements, it is recommended that pregnant women and newborn mothers increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should take.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic makeup of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that poor diets had a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the rate, although Nine's trying to take over the lead at Today's Show
Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry's argument that the costs of avoiding liberal leadership could not be sufficiently high for Today.
Nine's early show from national capital after Malcolm Turnbull's release to Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise and enemy David Koche and Samantha Armytage met in London as part of a week long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not appear that this tyranny of distance to Aussie TV was so much concerned because it recorded on average 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers on today's broadcast.
Today, she noted a smaller increase in her evaluation compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was until last Thursday (343,000).
Today, in recent months, he's filling up an empty space on Sunrise.
In August today there were an average of 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was moving between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 spectators and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Winds of change affect more this morning than Parliament alone, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine. Thank you for the suggestion!

The great news for Seven was the amazing debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children to the eastern part of New Zealand, has on average a very impressive 1,219 million spectators.
Critics were wondering if Thomson himself could pull a TV shot without a star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a clear yes.
The X Factor from Seven has kept strong 1,136 million spectators, which has defeated The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed follow-up on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half of the new TV show (from 17:00 to 17:30) that Andrew O'Keefe mentioned had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623 000 spectators — enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators and the second half of an incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the decrease in The Chase Australia from the second night, Nina will be convinced that the Hot Seat at 17:30 will finally win.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dollar Minute series that failed to beat McGuiru's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect boy - but who will choose?
The Secret Revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezan Markoski may not have found out who won the Bachelor.
The woman that Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is exposed to an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls that stay will definitely not reveal who's the right to finally get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows the day before we were just two left, thankless told us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his tongue on his teeth to the fourth final.
All three women lyrically sang why Wood was a perfect man, quoting his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as the reason why they wanted to be his partner.
Either way, when asked, "If not, who will get Wood's final flower?" their answers could work as a spy about who gets the heart of Bachelor.
Like Jeavons-Fellows, Markosky quickly named Mackay as the one who would best fit in with Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been sharing an easy relationship for a certain day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched Sarah and Sam's energy, I felt that they were quite compatible and I still think it during the course," Jeavons-Fellows says.
"Sarah is a really country woman, she's very funny with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
It's good and nice together.
Sarah Mackay thinks that Sam Wood could make a great couple.
She claims herself that during his last visit at home she realized that Wood might be "the real one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was not just a game - I now opened my whole heart to him," he adds.
I was wondering who Wood would choose if it wasn't for her.
"I don't know if I can say it," she said.
I like both girls anyway - it's between Snow White and Lana indistinguishably.
Bachlor is broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States and many teams questioned his excellent start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches left Hayne sitting after the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which made the conversion of the Australian rugby league at the first takeoff at Tuesday's 20:3 in Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush got hurt.
Tomsula was also still honest in the dress after the game.
Instead of burning the new ones before the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, stated that Hayne also received encouragement from the Special Team Coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and just take care of another game.
Already in the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne made his mistake.
It was certainly not the beginning for Hayne and his massive Australian fan club to hope for his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught up in despair when after his mistake he left the field and later told the Australian Hamish & Andy radio duo on 2DayFM 104.1 worse career start in NFL he shouldn't even imagine.
"That happens, you're just focusing on another game and that's all," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trap to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own market area led to the three Queensland.
It was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne published a photo with fans who are holding an Australian flag on their own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Rus Vladimir Putin will meet in the debate on the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, Russia's richest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested by targeted guns on the Siberian rane.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts were limited.
The U.S.S. has stopped the immigrants who have been seeking property replacements.
Two of them emigrated in 1984 and their property acquired a new owner.
Since 1989 the property could no longer be returned, the two have applied for damages under the law on extrajudicial rehabilitation.
The Court first assigned them the amount required, i.e. more than 2.8 million crowns, but their claim changed by granting them only a few 90 thousand crowns with reference to the fact that the amount of the refund is determined in accordance with the 1991 price rules.
The Emigrants were detained by the Supreme Court and they were initially charged with a fine.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay off the money, but turned to the U.S. complaints.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the then applicable legislation - although it represented an adequate compensation in relation to the property mentioned - is only a fraction of the value of the property today.
"This can't go to the burden of accompanying participants who have been claiming their rights since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to provide a refund before," the judge explained to the rapporteur, Jaroslav Fenyk, why the U.S.S. has been on the side of immigrants.
"The ÚS has repeatedly expressed itself in order for the General Courts to proceed in return cases in such a way that any inconsistencies may not be ruled out in the failure of the eligible persons and that the purpose of the return legislation is always achieved, i.e. the imposition of a property charge caused by the earlier totalitarian state," the judge added.
Evitu in music Studio DVA now creates Radka Fischer.
By the way, Radka Fischer became the world's youngest Evit, when in 1998, she became the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perón in her 20th year of 1998 in the first Czech introduction of this famous musician Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague Theatre Spiral.
To return to the same role, he says: "To this day, Evita's troubles have not been overbalanced."
It's not just an amazing role, it's also a responsibility.
Monika Absolon recommended the role of the first lady of Argentina.
I saw Monca in Evita three times, and it certainly was inspiring for me.
I saw a whole new concept here.
I'm a very good friend of the more modern arrangements, but this is just a little bit of a saying.
"The director of Ondřje Sokola is original, relaxed and contemporary," Fischer notes.
The musical ice between the two singers will be presented at the National Concert of Monica Absolon on September 27 from 19 hours in Studio DVA.
Tonight he's done with music from Evita.
Among the experiences will certainly belong to a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Push your crying, Argentina!).
In a limited number of presentations from the director's desk, Ondrej Sokol will also jump off when he will be present during the film of Karl Roden as President of Perón.
In the interest of the public, further deadlines were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech world music studio Evita introduces Studio DVA in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
In the mode of Ondřje Sokola, Monica Absolon originally studied the main role of women.
On her side, Karel Roden appears as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenáčik.
The legendary songs from the work of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech texts by Michael Prostějovský sound as part of a live orchestra led by Kristof Mark, who has already participated in the first performance in the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after the police shot rubber missiles at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber missiles in front of demonstrators against the proposal of the new state constitution, the official said on Wednesday.
There was violence on Tuesday night in the Rupande District, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Head of Periodic Officer, says more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the police station and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal points out that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they moved to the rubber missiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber missiles, known for their ability to kill, were traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This conflict was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern mountain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic groups say they have created a new province under the proposed new constitution and have mitigated their political influence.
Further demonstrations in Western Nepal were also recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which requires the establishment of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
when the four main political parties signed the agreement on dividing the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been going on since 2008, but the legislators have speeded up the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week the lawmakers in Kathmandu voted on the proposal for a Constitution and the officials stated that the new Charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We mustn't panic right now.
After you passed the ice on the master of Lithuania you couldn't even have a home duel with hockey Sparta (3:5).
Don't you have any concerns about a similar catastrophic entry into the extraliga as you did a year ago?
I hope nothing like this is happening again.
Congratulations, Folk.
NHC predicts the 60 percent probability of cyclones south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verden islands is likely to have a 60 percent probability of tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, said the U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Ants also has 60 percent probability of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, adding weather forecast with Miami residence.
Google launched a campaign to choose $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said it would launch a campaign aimed at choosing $11 million for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees who flooded European states in the war of abandoned and poor countries.
Google announced this on its blog a very unusual path.
The report on her blog was published by the employee Google Rita Masoud on the basis of personal experience, when she was seven years old and was snooping with her family from Kabul.
"We traveled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," Masoudová said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families, like her, are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed between 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that all contributions made through the google.com/refugeerelief website amount to $5.5 million double.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees from World War II. Most of them come from Syria, abandoned by four years of war, which has only spared 4 million people this year.
Many people also flee the war of rejected Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics there may be useful surgery of loss
The benefits of losing surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too soon to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after death surgery than those with non-surgical treatment.
"The evidence of mortality lasts a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on the surgery of death, who wrote the introduction to the new JAMA surgery study.
Surgery operations, bariatric surgery are used to reduce the stomach of different methods.
Reduction of hunger and restriction of the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of the studies have been conducted in subjects with morbidity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or more.
BMI, which measures the weight ratio of the height, is considered normal in values between 18,5 and 24,9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicate the overweight of persons and people with a value of more than 30 are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan have used data collected from the study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and gastrectomy - in the treatment procedures of type 3 diabetes in people who have been slightly obese.
The average BMI among those involved in the operation fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained almost the same for those who did not receive the surgical treatment of diabetes 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and in part in 28 cases.
In the group treated for the comparison of diabetes, only 1 percent and only 2 percent of patients were completely resolved.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers also monitored patients on the level of haemoglobin of A1c in the blood, which reflects the transient level of blood sugar in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7%, according to researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
However, this value remained at about 8 percent in the group treated.
But this better "glycemic control" - reflected in better levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After a fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 to 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 to 5.1), and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% to 2.1%) and were more likely to have diabetes (46.9% to 16.7%).
While the new study does not improve survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to life extension, Blackstone from the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix says.
According to the Swedish study, obstetrics who underwent barbaric surgery were about 29% more likely to survive in the next 15 years compared to a group that tested more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show improvement in survival among patients after surgery, Blackstone says it is a comforting result for BMI people under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This work is critical right here because it indicates that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group," he says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone further claims that people and their doctors should start taking the weight really seriously after the decrease in BMI patients between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long for people to reveal the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think that once the collection of these genetic changes that are firmly interlinking their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the journey back is really tough.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to understand all refugees, Dalai Lama said, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the cessation of violence in the home countries of refugees.
Dalajlama was concerned about the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He argued that, under the present circumstances, the interest of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, no matter how amazing, was inadequate in this situation in the refugee crisis.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to solve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"The pursuit of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution, how to bring true peace and real development, and especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We have to restrict the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing violence issues, Dalai Lama also expressed complaints about George Bush's 9/11 terrorist attack and claims that "the violent response of the United States has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences to President Bush's letter and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent journey.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," he said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have survived the cure in the last 4 years
The United States Toxicological Centre reported an almost 400-percent increase from 2010 in the number of children up to 12 years of age who drank a high alcoholic remedy according to the Toxicological Centre in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Toxicological Centre of Georgia, the number of births in children up to 12 years of age reported at the control centre of poison increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"The children are getting more frequent to these products and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to the emergency," Lopez CNN said.
Some children drink sanitation deliberately, while others want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge to social media.
Youtube videos show natives drinking sanitation because of cheap habits.
During the next few years, they reportedly mixed the sanitation with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the remedy.
"Children don't think about it could hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot more attractive (sanitary) are those that are perfumed.
Sanitation products with the smell of strawberries, grep or oranges that are very soft for children are available.
The remedy contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several may have an alcohol poisoning effect.
"It's a highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Control Center of Toxicology at the University of Kansas Hospital.
A glass of whiskey you wouldn't just let go of it, but people leave these sanitation products out and when they get kids to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaija Russel, a six - year - old girl who recently attended school, saw up to four places of sanitation with strawberry smell and was taken away for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is a double threshold considered to be an adult drink, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Guinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaija uttered invisible words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a solitary baby hospital for any signs of brain trauma, because the girl had fallen for alcohol and had been stabbed in the head, says Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Nhaija's mother.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers the use of non-alcoholic products or to arrange for childcare.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some remedies have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after the collapse of the sanitation facility, which contained toxic, undeclared ingredients.
Doctors thought that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, more than ethanol, which was mentioned as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth year in North New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the room," says the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and banned their presence in the room.
The police considered the cursed plan as "innocent conjecture," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Fam: No matches on Celtic team
Griffiths is stockpiling up the talk about the insomnia in Celtic, while Deila admits that Hoops is in the wrong place, but he's turning it around again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton fear that the new ice powers will disrupt the team unit.
Dons raise their jump over Celtic by 5 points
The Penalties of the first half of Adama Rowone's administration assured Aberdeen of a close victory over Hamilton in Pitttodria, which gave Dons a five-point leap between him and Celtic.
Griffiths rejects talk about insomnia
This situation has led to riots in Celtic, which have been challenged by Griffiths, which insists that he and his associates do not work under any pressure from increased supervision in preparations for a match with the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of Scottish title rivals bore the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Deputy Rangers and former Dutch representative Ronald de Boer argues that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry for title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador Ajax, says, "In the Netherlands they don't show the best of Celtic matches anymore, and why?"
Because there's no Rangers.
These people aren't just talking about the Rangers return.
He's talking about the old company.
They're talking about both teams together, and they're just interested in that.
In the Old Company matches there is great tension and not only people from Scotland are following these games.
I'm turning things around for good, Deil's committed.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a bit confused, but the Norwegian chief committed himself to turning things back to the good.
The defeat of Malme and the following descent from the League of Masters was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and is now referring to the top of the board with a five-point jump.
But Deila says, "Celtic's been through a bad time and he's gonna get up again."
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the current.
We're exactly the same - but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic support because it makes players much better.
Now it's very important to stay with you.
Warburton's worried about freezing power.
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago and pointed out that he had already identified some of his ice targets, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the large purchase of power and insists that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox team.
Former chief Brentford says, "The ice transition window is very different from this summer."
Players who come in in the summer have a whole preseasonal period to stay, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
The transitional target of Celtica Micha indicates retirement
The attacker Swansea Mich, who was connected with Celtic in the transitional window, indicated that after breaking his contract with Swansea, he could retire.
The 20-year-old shooter has already had two years of trouble with the tilting angler and has failed to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Patterson was sent into the closet and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on this shield was later cancelled - one about the third red card issued by decision-makers Collum, who was revoked.
Neilson stands behind his claim and says, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths committed himself to avoiding Tynacastle
The stubborn Hibbe was severely punished after he confessed to singing a song with a text aimed at the former player Hearts Rudolf Skacel.
The incident took place in the Roserburn area in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tinacastle in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was a dangerous moment," the attacker said and continues: "I can say for sure that I will not go back to Tynacastle unless it's in Celtic dress."
The Council in Denmark believes in Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United council still believes in correcting the situation by current team management - but admits that the fall on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boy ready for action again," says Donnellly.
MCInnes likes to be a "bad victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to stand desperate against Hamilton Accies in order to succeed in winning the seventh league victory after itself and five-point jump before Celtic on the top of the table thanks to the first half penalty in Adam Rowey's administration.
McInnes says: "There is no team that won anything, whether Cups or Leagues, without winning this type of game."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged, while the UK's overall unemployment is rising.
In Scotland, unemployment remains unchanged for 164,000 in the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK fell from 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The figure of Scottish unemployment was 5.9 per cent above the level in the UK (5.5 per cent), as reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three-month period, the number of workers now stopped at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell by 74.0 per cent during the quarter - which is a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The Secretary of State of Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly the year that Scotland has made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have witnessed further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment has grown, while unemployment has fallen.
Why I've been a witness to the recovery in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I'm going to follow the man's death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in the gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who's going to fix the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officers who would witness his death.
I first received an invitation in January through my best friend and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I'm starting to be afraid of it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists should be allowed to monitor repairs in America and because they are often more than free places, a morbid lottery is held which will decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of posts for journalists from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will be watching the whole correction without delay.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends and create a special bond with him through the month of calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like that boy.
We laugh a lot when we talk together.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a note block and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll soon have to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my neutrality on Twitter.
This is a lesson.
Tell him the story of behavior as soon as he's done it, get access.
I complained to her.
She assumed that "it could have formulated better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could ever get me out of the witness list.
But he wants an international journalist who'll be ready to tell the story.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post journalist, will be on my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His acts after the murder of Barry Van Treese would have made him guilty of a crime.
But I believe there is a great likelihood that he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty has not been provided.
In my opinion, the correction is wrong.
And from this point of view, I'm going to watch his death.
I can't say I'm being really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the man I love die the rest of death.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale was left dry after he fired a man from Canning River.
The man from Petrha who ran away from the police didn't get out after he got into a small bay water just a mile away from the cop who tried to talk him out of violence to get back on the shore.
The Canning Vale police were called in on Tuesday during an incident that went beyond Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get them out of the river Canning.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated "I'm not going out, just come for me," said Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to wash his uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic and a police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do fun when they run," Castledine said.
The Ben Cousins football champion provides a memorable example.
In 2006 Cousins drove his car to the mainland to avoid the bus and try to cross the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired locals to start planning the Ben Cousins Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the editors tried to spy on him and threaten him with the end of the race
Peeter Moody accused the director of Racing Victoria that last year they tried to get him a spy and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the editors and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and was based on the conviction that they had a personal campaign against him with Lady Tataya's late exhumation on the day of the competition, which was his last drop in the middle.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the race and felt in a difficult situation with regard to Lidar's positive blow to a cobalt that he couldn't explain.
He jumped into the tongue about the accusations of espionage for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry horror."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it'll all come out of you," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm gonna have a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with my head up and let the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking again, I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Earlier Moody released in his interview for the racing.com bomb that the department's integrity tried to spy on him.
"Before eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will call after a question - and offered him employment in my booths to find out about the things that are going on in my booths," Moody said at Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information because they're trying to catch me completely burned.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current director general of RVL, were aware of it at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's a personal matter?
Will RVL grow a few balls and arrange for people outside the training position to take responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe this is where people think they are.
Maybe they need my license and get me out of here, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will provide them with material to think about.
But I got to the point when I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
I'm really sorry.
I'm going to press on them and I'm going to take care of them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family, and I can leave.
The level of frustration of the coach increased with a long-term investigation of cobalt, including leaders, and recent embezzlement in it caused the feeling that "may be an hour of his license on the table."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of the unbeatable Black Caviar champion, marked the rule of treatment on the day of the race as "smiley" after the horse was applied to the feet of a wooden siege or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone from my team mistook his leg with a blue.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and so did it.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of siege on the day of the race to which the authors had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobra's driver who caught him was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a cyclist on the weekend in Cobra and left after the wheel.
The cyclist was transported by plane to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley main road on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping and helping the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected that it will be accused of failure to stop an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in hospital in stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy hits rivals due to a wrestling claim
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticised the actions of his players as "setting the plan" to two NRL favorites of the premiere.
Trent Robinson, coach Sydney Roosters, said that the decision-makers allowed Storm players to "shock" his players during the Storm team's controversial victory in Sydney's final qualification on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly lost note on Strorm after his team won the final qualification over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game a "survey" rugby league and according to him two from Queensland were not "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended the actions of his players and said they were focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his self-awareness because his team was criticized by two leading coaches, which could mean they were afraid of defeating the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beat 24-2," Bellamy said.
I can assure you that in the last year we have not changed anything from our defensive system and technology, in the last few weeks we have only focused on contact during the steps, and that meant turning around.
Trent has been here for three years and obviously is training a great team, so it's probably not common to lose, which could have been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how things like that always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy underestimated Bennet's idea of "arousing football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 premiere of "naked" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. She was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game that he seems to be adoring, especially his young hostages with their speed.
Such a football you would like to play if you had this type of players available.
This opinion said in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his football style - but not every team has two hostages like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It inspires more self-awareness in me because they say things like that because they're afraid of fighting against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they were getting into big fights.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that more branches fell in the Storm and Roosters match than in the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos team game was probably good, I wasn't watching, but what's the score?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or is it interesting to stop and stop trying?
I think it's an agenda.
If they mention us, it means we'll meet again at a certain stage.
Storm have this weekend's break and won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks at the preliminary final next Saturday evening in AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of the next Tuesday.
Serbian man won $200,000 bail for drug charges
The man who faced the possible experience of holding 40 kilograms of cocaine that was ruined from Queensland received $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of five men who arrested a federal police officer looking for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, who came from South America through Vanuatu and landed in Coomer last month.
Maximovic was observed meeting with the defendants at the port during the morning and later met them at Coomer Roadhouse's cafe, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential judgement of his experience in the possession of cocaine of commercial quality, lawyer Maksimovice defended that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could be completely accidental and innocent in the coffee shop.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan thought Maximovic would run away.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said at the courthouse.
In the Crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Mother and stepfather Maximovice jointly offered bail 200 000 USD for his release.
"After reading the two persons' sworn statements, it is obvious that the deposit of bail 200 000 USD is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their own efforts were clearly insufficient because the accused did not get further to the court, he warned.
Maximovic has been given bail provided that he surrenders both the Australian and the Serbian passport, will report to the police daily and will observe the ban from 18 hours in the evening until 6 p.m.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophile used the phone with eleven-year-old girls to get photos of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep, then applied to her online chat, where he had a lot of rude photos of kids who sent him another user.
The girl then looked up and found out that she was missing her phone and then found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She passed it and before she warned her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police were involved and saw five photos, then analytical computers found an address and discovered "anxious" search on the web using expressions to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then told the police that his reason was "to wear pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretend he was a police officer and scared them."
Tax representative Elid Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was a dependency - that it depended on people's fears.
He admitted that he was doing a computer search, but he claims he just wanted to pretend he was a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send another.
According to him, he did it to get them
He says he jumped out of his drink and said he wanted to see images of violence and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on her phone, she called her mother and cried and cried.
She saw immoral images on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to the girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, a place in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted guilty of bringing an action for the adoption or provision of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, violated the conditions of bail on 25 January and did not reach a hearing before the court on 24 March this year.
The defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sexual deliberants, because he could argue that in his act there was "no basic sexual subtext."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his judgment in October to report on social workers.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on a list of sexual delicents before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe made a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the African oldest leader, fell on the stairs leading to the stage earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but his video fell viral in social media.
The opening of Parliament was also confirmed by the statements of opposition legislators that they received anonymous threats to the killings they had been warned of during Mr Mugabe's speech.
Last month it was written and provoked during his speech about the state of the nation in parliament - which is the word he repeated on Tuesday.
The president of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition policies had adopted text messages on their mobile phones with a warning to prevent Mr Mugabe from speaking.
"The report comes from a number that does not appear, but is called 'death'," he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in Parliament and once it leaves Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has concerns about threats to Members.
Hewlett-Packard is going to reduce the number of jobs to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard abolishes 25 000 to 30,000 jobs within its efforts to restructure and save business costs.
The HP company will later be divided into two companies listed on the stock exchange and will split the business with computers and printers from its faster growing company hardware and services operations.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change in the amount of approximately $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, the HP declaration states.
"These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, Director-General of HP and Chairman of the Representation, who will be in charge of the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than today's HP and will have a wide and wide portfolio of business that will help businesses move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the requirements of our customers all over the world.
Hewlett Parkard Enterprise will have more than $50 billion a year after the company's declaration of receipt and "will focus on providing non-competitive integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will result in the deployment of a company founded in 1930 by the graduates of the Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who manufacture electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was renamed "the home of Silicon Valley."
HP has been undergoing massive reorganisation to manage the shift from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This trend of HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a closely specialised company has better results.
Captain of Arsenal Mikel Arteta says that the co-players must get for the wounded Jack Wilsher in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilsher that he's still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there's no reason he doesn't play Christmas again.
This best scenario already means that Wilsher will certainly miss at least four more English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next summer European championship is clearly not true.
The big damage to this latest problem is that Wilsher ended last season strong after the angle wound and then again got into the former shape during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten your career," Wenger says.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
He doesn't care about anything special.
It was just an accident.
It didn't concern his ankles or the injury he suffered before.
This could be from a purely medical point of view because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
The study conducted by Prime Minister Injuries Ltd. has recorded 23 different injuries to Wilshera since six years ago.
During the last five years, he has played only 65 league matches in Arsenal from a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal this means that in the sixth of the eight seasons since 2007-08 was one of the two Premier League clubs that lost most days for injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the magic circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back after injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win a competition," Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will and will have a career he deserves.
Arsenal is campaigning in the League of Champions on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb fighting with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to run his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to arrive.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain the balance and let the players who need it breathe," Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the F group, Maximir in Zagreb has the most fearsome stadium in Europe.
Dynamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after last season held the campaign "invincible".
At midnight, the stadium was shaken by a 3.2-degree earthquake of Richter.
That was the year in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal learned from the last season of the League of Champions, when he was capitalizing against Monaco and is left with distant hopes that he will lead the club to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This move is huge," Wenger says.
It never happened to Arsenal.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar displays in different shows is striking, especially since it is necessary for men to open up more desperate than ever, as it is true of suicide among young men under 15 years of age.
In 2013, it was the only cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the United Kingdom and remained three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to solve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked 2015 as the Year of Man, whose aim is to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
There is a friendship in the heart of this struggle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of over 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that in the event that the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends represents a half chance of mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, of course, it must be reachable first.
In this communication through social media with emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate response is often preferred before meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look stronger, more entertaining and more successful, even though we are actually more isolated.
This superficial success is governed by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, everything on the basis of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - that have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game maker explained recently, money really doesn't buy more happiness.
The beauty of the series Friends was the source of this thought to him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personality, which was highlighted through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all the sources of knowledge that yes, men can also identify themselves with it, even though most of them leave their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: ....my role as listeners of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies has really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with their friends.
The old order "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be seen as weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the sequences that will arise in my mind when I try to offer a longer-term reconciliation mechanism.
It highlights a few moments in a man's friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the state of outside on the phone helps people in times of despair, but long-term support must come from a closer, network of friends and family.
So if you're going to the FriendsFest scheduled Comedy Central station this weekend, why not take your friends to a bottle in Central Perk, where the interior for the occasion of the celebration will be completely reprocessed.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and greet him.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
Series Friends will be sent to Comedy Central Station from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped the PSG place Malmo side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidim and Edinson Cavanim after shooting the branch against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored his debut in the League of Masters and helped PSG defeat the Swedish Malmo team on Tuesday.
Here's the report of the match and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in the Tuesday match and Paris Saint-Germain started their trip to the League of Champions with the final comfort victory 2-0 against Malma at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the branch less than four minutes after her debut in the League of Masters, and this player PSG sent French champions to win, then they threw a few chances until they finally raised their jump when Cavani shot the branch in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, because they are not only focused on the qualification of cutting wheels, but on improving their journey to the quarter finals that they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they won three points, it was not the classic performance of the Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic team was a marnotratic and later set up against his home team and club, in which he started his famous career in 1999.
"In the League of Masters it is not easy to win out or home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, even if there are things we will have to improve with the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two more bars.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, which kept this weekend 2-2 with Bordeaux in Liza 1, but was exposed to Di Mario in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who moved the PSG in Europe to a new level after a transition from Manchester United that took place last month, and showed why when he ran on Mark Verratti's passport for Malma's defense and with a beautiful wedding he sent a ball behind Johan Wilda to the far-off corner of the branch.
However, if someone expected it to start a great PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off and got to this stage, entered with 9 internationals in the basic composition and five defenders and two hidden hostages were a heavy opponent.
But in addition to the shooting of Nikola Djurdjice, who just passed the remote corner of Kevin Trappa in the 34th minute, they didn't offer it much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG itself was benefiting from the attack by bad recordings and poor marriages, which were not good either from Ibrahimovice, who failed to shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot reached the net shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, it proved much more appropriate when it came to preparing a chance for his teammates, and it was from his recording that Di Maria sent a round arrow that ended up in the Wild Coast in 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after the hour of the game thanks to Cavanim, this Uruguayan headman sent the sixth goal of this season in line after Ibrahimovic played him after playing him from the left wing of Maxwell.
This brought to an end all Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they might be more difficult to get out of the game, and only the extraordinary action of Wilda from a very close lost the hopes of David Louise and the score remained unchanged even at a time when the goal of ezequiel Lavezhi was not known at the end of the match.
Coach Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was top-level over his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the League of Masters was held in December last year."
Since then, we've only played a Swedish league that's not on the same level.
Qualification matches are not enough.
Downstairs for Paris.
It was a great match for them.
Glencore made $25 billion for stock sales
The heavy giant Glencore, who was hit by a loss of commodity prices in Switzerland, made an average of $2.5 billion of the sale of shares under its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in his statement that she sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
This company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is faced with the undercutting of commodity prices, as China’s slowdown in the economy reduces demand and fuels a sharp decline across the market.
The law issue sent Glencore's stock price to the top of the London stock market in early morning shops.
The shares jumped by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pensions on the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore discovered last week that sales of shares worth $2.5 billion are part of wider plans to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which has accumulated about a third
The company sold new shares in the price of 123 pence for the share, which meant a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
Thus, 1.3 billion shares were released at a total price of 9.99 per cent per group.
Concerns about the extension of Chinese growth have been reduced by between 20 and 40 percent by iron ore about half and coal, copper and other commodities.
The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping is visiting the United States at the end of the month, confirming the White House in his Tuesday report.
The first visit of President Xi to Washington will take place on September 25 in the Barack Obama response to a visit to Beijing, where the President welcomed in November.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his even Peng Liyuan to the state dinner that will take place after the talks are over.
"The visit of President Xi provides an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between the USA and China and encourages cooperation in addressing problems of international, regional and common interest and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the differences between the two states," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at the United Nations September session.
Obama and Xi are expected to solve the controversial problems, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyberspiring and its increasing aggressiveness in the waters of the South Sea.
How the refugee crisis has ruined the Schengen area.
The emergency lights fired by Germany have not nearly silenced the European crew, but it is already forcing the ship to change course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
On Monday, the European Union decided to deal with the refugee problem: it will be more systematic to classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they step on the old continent - especially in Greece, than to deal with the future distribution of refugees on the basis of quotas based on the quantities which are still more and more distant.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 out of 28 EU countries to redeploy 160 thousand refugees, ministers of the Member States changed their priorities.
Before taking care of the final destination of the runners, it is necessary to first filter those who arrive today and resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"The effective management of the EU's external borders is necessary for managing migration," stressed in the text discussed by ministers in Brussels on Monday.
After the single currency crisis, the EU finds that it is in danger in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increases its pressure.
It renews border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flood of asylum seekers in this country.
The central power makes it clear that there is no free movement without it in Europe.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France also consider this, even though with different intensity.
Hungary's been working on it a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the Schengen rules.
That it's a domino effect, but it's also blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already gone to their home country.
French Minister of Interior Bernard Caseneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizière held an intensive discussion with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea isn't new, but it's getting tired.
In Italy, according to informal statistics, two thirds of new incoming runners have already been registered and identified with fingerprints.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point in its territory because it fears more than others so that there will be no camps on its borders in which refugees will gather on its account.
The real black hole remains Greece.
On its islands near the Turkish coast, more than 200 thousand people arrived this year, twice as much as they had recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after the overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge rabbit hole.
Athens who are still in financial turmoil waiting for a new government put their hands in the ground.
This is the starting point for the Balkan route and the source of the current joint care for German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Juncker's commission promises that the checkpoints will be introduced as soon as possible, but it has not entered any number or date.
"The challenges Greece faces relate to Europe as a whole," EU ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on this front.
It is therefore a matter of setting up a European Border Control Agency team in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for the reception of refugees and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"There will be a need for adequate financial resources," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
From the point of view of the law, they will still have the last word of Athens.
The issue of the creation of genuine European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching.
The new emergency situation of the eighty-eight, as well as the second issue of mandatory quotas and 160 thousand refugees, which had been brought about by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament since the beginning of the year, strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Holland.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their superiority.
Number, not duty, was kept on Monday in text approved by most eighty-eight.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, which has already been reached in June during the EU Hectic Summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead in the Alps, possibly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed a cow in the French Alps.
According to the German authorities, she is also the woman who survived as the only one of the affected eight-year-olds.
The previous media reports said it was Polka.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with a serious leg injury.
The dead formed mostly forty according to the AFP.
"The rescue action ended, and the victim's body was also transferred to Briancon's identification," Hautes-Alpes Department Prefect Pierre Besnard said.
Unfortunately it happened around noon in the mountain area of Pelvoux under the peak of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The Suddenly Vina was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said the chief of rescuers Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, a huge amount of snow covered an eight - foot - high [3,900 m] group.
Meteorological service today did not warn in the area before the adverse weather.
Torpišovský before the fight with Brago: Finally a real Europe.
Coach Jindrich Trpišovský at his premiere in the Cup proved to be able to pass through the front lines of the European League to the core group and now he is looking forward to using the right Europe with the team.
Slovan at the opening of the main stage of the competition welcomes the finalist from 2011 Bragu and according to the spectator wants to impose his game style.
After all the nerves in the cutting fights, when every goal and every situation could turn you off on your way to a sleepy group, now we're there and we're gonna play six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to be afraid of every hacked branch, we can play our tactics, and we're not just tied up with a double tape.
"I look forward to it and it is a real Europe, before it was just a qualification," Trpišovski said at a press conference.
Bragu thinks he's a top team.
It will be very active, they have Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at balls.
The opponent may be even harder to say he doesn't have such a name, but in his frame he has a player who's tipping Manchester with three goals.
"It's an excellent total at the top level of teams," Trpišovský said.
But Brag doesn't think he's in favour.
I'm taking it like we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we've shown both in home competition and in preschools that we're strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the viewer, whose team lost 11 duels this season's only the opening Super Cup in Plšna.
They believe that Liberec can also force Braze into his style.
A team that's gonna be strong on the balls is waiting for us, at the same time they're not usually disciplined.
They play from 4-4-2 resolution with a quick transition to an aggressive phase.
"It is a very difficult opponent, but we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players will do it on the field," said Trpišovský.
In the forewords we studied a lot of rivals, which helped us very much, this time we want to focus on our game, which we have even assigned training.
"And we definitely want, even though it will be very difficult to play according to our notes," the viewer added.
Student films dominate the sand, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries submitted their works this year to the 15th anniversary of the International Student Film Festival in Pisa.
Four dozen of them, which the commission of students and educators sent to the final, will be held from 15 to 18 October in Portyč.
The best of them is the international jury, the speaker said to the Jakub Charvát festival.
Each year, the festival has its special theme, which takes place from the festival dream.
This year she's a detective.
The director of this year's celebrations Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
"And of course we also have to resolve the crime that was committed on our tour this year," Charvatt said.
Visitors will see the choice of the most interesting of the student creation - plays, animated and documentary films.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, for example the winner of last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
Festival organizers prepare an accompanying programme as each year.
Comes Vatican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřey Ruml, professional player on didgeridoo Ondřij Smeykal, turbošanson group We're flying?, playing band Grapes or for example Petra Hapkova with a life story at the bar.
The festival will host two photography exhibitions.
The first entry of the graduate of the sand film school and the holder of prestigious awards, including not missing it from the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Aschenbrenner.
The second exhibition is near the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber and the writer Brunner, Novotny and Hlach at the workshop of Socrates Jan Novotny's baptism his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříčka, the patron of FAMO in Pisca, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his links that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint ties and film bands," the speaker said.
This will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, graduate several job competitions at once and get such a job position.
The festival is linked to the creation of the private professional film school in Písk.
Her founders, her husband Vladana and Miloň Terč, organized the first year of 1997.
By the sixth anniversary, he's done once in two years.
In the event of a decrease in the CK, the insurers shall be entitled to claim the full amount of the client's claims.
Insurance institutions should comply with customer requirements when the travel office falls in full.
She decided on this on Wednesday when she approved an amended new legislation on the conditions of business in travel.
Travel agents will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee according to the proposal to be assessed in the Senate.
The insurance companies with the obligation to grant claims to customers and above the limit of sitting do not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development maintains, argues for consumer protection.
Insurance firms have already threatened to end insurance for travel offices against crime when the new one is paid.
But the proposal is also criticised by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they're either gonna have to end up or go abroad.
Minister for Local Development Karla Schlechtová (for the UN) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not Eurocomform.
She noted this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client has a claim for full repayment of the money regardless of the limit of insurance.
Insurance companies will receive enough information on the management of travel offices and will be able to set the right limit, stressed by Schlecht.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but must have such a limit to be feasible," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank guarantee is not going to work because no one gives it unlimited.
"The travel offices will have to finish or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
The Chairman of the Association of Czech Travel Offices and the agency Tomio Okamura (SPD) with Kalusk's concerns on the basis of a survey between the members of the CK did not agree.
"Stop leading us lobbying insurance," he said.
The statement of insurance shall not be regarded as relevant, nor shall any official written statement of insurance in that sense be considered to exist in the sense that it does not exist.
But they're checking out if the travel offices are going to get together, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
She also warned Jana Fischer (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the Association of Travellers of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who was talking about climbing stairs to the Czech travel office.
Travel offices according to Fischer will not be able to settle insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Judge Fischer.
Her proposal for the release of the contested passport was not approved by the Snowman.
Nor did Vojtich Filip (KSCM) come forward with a proposal to return the proposal to the committee for a alleged dispute with the Civil Code.
Philip pointed out to travel agencies that he considered to be a danger to consumers.
The rapporteur, Mr Berdichová (ANO), in view of the interpretation of the Constitutional Court's proposal, drew up a proposal limiting the liability of insured persons in cases where they could not know that the implementation of insurance did not cover the full risk.
In the new one, there will be no originally proposed minimum four million insurance limit for passenger offices offering air transport tickets and a million limit for offices selling, for example, bus tickets.
The thresholds will remain at 30 per cent of the planned markets from the sales of trains.
However, the limit of insurance compliance will have to be such that, in the event of a failure, the travel office will cover all customer claims.
The standard even after the adjustments provides that travel agencies will have to re-instate the travel agency which organises the journey at the sold events.
Travel agents will have to submit to insurance companies prior to the conclusion of the contract, inter alia, information on the economy and the number of arrivals.
The approved amending proposal of the Public Administration Committee shall also be included with further regular information.
Travellers will have to provide them with monthly information on the number of passengers and the number of flights sold, the total price of the flights sold and the amount of stocks and markets for and notices to them.
Where the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel office has failed to fulfil any of the legal obligations to the insurance company, it shall invite it, in accordance with the proposal for repair or may prohibit it from concluding new contracts if the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of the customers.
Novela is also going to re-adjust the funding of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the mountain service grant on the basis of its request, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the following year.
The request will contain a report on the use of state money last year, a financial plan for expenditure and a two-year outlook.
According to the association, the legislator did not consider what would happen if the insurance company declared the CK contract.
It won't be too late to arrange a ride and the customers who bought a ride before the insurance certificate, so they'll come up with it according to the association.
In such a case, the CK suffers significant loss and may even end, although its economy was in good condition.
One of the ways in which travel agencies can deal with such a situation will be the claim for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use a lot of softer conditions abroad and then on our market we will only act as agencies, said Vice-President Jan Papež.
The new proposal, however, also contains a bank guarantee institution, but is so thoughtless that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, because the bank guarantee cannot sound like an unlimited amount.
In addition, according to the association, the change in current practice is de facto unnecessary.
The whole law will need to be recast within two years of the new EU Directive.
The Czech market now operates a total of 942 active insured travel offices.
Only three CKs completed their activity this year.
This country's travel office sells annual tours worth about CZK 20 billion.
Merkelová: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must be founded on improving humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of fugitives to Europe.
It was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after the German Prime Minister's interview.
At the same time, it appealed once again to the division of refugees who had already arrived in the EU between eight hundred and eighty Member States.
We need to help more countries where refugees leave, if any, where they stay after they leave the country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we are on the basis of decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, the German Chancellor said that such a signal could also lead to higher financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
"The coalition countries also support the German government in calling for a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis on European countries," Merkel added.
Land Prime Minister Braniborska Dietmar Woidke said in this context at the press conference that he expects genuine solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of EU runners on the basis of long-term quotas is rejected, inter alia, by the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke for speeding up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know first if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start with the integration of foreigners more quickly, said the Branibor prime minister.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of the routine should serve to integrate those who have a chance to obtain asylum.
There will be a need for more teachers to take over the German refugees.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the practice can be integrated, they can benefit us, he said.
Matt Damon's bagatizing diversity in the film
Matt Damon confronted Effie Brown's aphroamatic filmmaker during a discussion of diversion with the claim that it wasn't necessary behind scenes.
During the Sunday episode of the Greenlight project HBO interrupted the actor contained in the Brown series, stressing the need for alternative views regarding black protagonists in the scenario.
"When we're talking about diversity, you're doing it with film content, not with show content," Damon says.
Surprised, she reacted to Brown with disbelief and exclaimed, "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when comments about Martjan got to the broadcast.
Damon and Brown joined a well-known producer named Ben Affleck and Brother Farrely to discuss the finalist shows.
"I would like to appeal to people to think that anyone is already the director, how they will behave in harmony," Brown said at first.
The only black character that's a hooker with a white belt.
The producer of Dear White People persecuted the finalists of Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to direct the film; Damon said that their director "would at last give us something we don't want."
After the discussion started, the social media exploded in harmony with Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni said he would like to write a clip, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black person in the room, so he can explain to her that the diversity is so BEAUTIFUL that it hurts."
Tweet received more than 5,000 retweet and 4,000 people since it was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of the social discussion.
After Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took a national effect and pressured the creation of laws and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against color people.
In February, the Prince sang on motion, while giving the nominations in the category of albums for a year during the Gramma price transfer.
"Alba is still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The latest leader Black Lives Matter presented a statement in answer to the question of the personality Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered as an hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the leaders declared.
Damon was recently announced on the list of boutiques, producers and media of moguls that were invited to visit the pope to discuss the display of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or he's already met with the Pope, it's not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
The professional watchmaker and little Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and take home a million dollars.
In the competition, which had just arranged for its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all obstacles to the track.
During the final season this year, two men fought for the last round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was 30 seconds of spleen for more than 220 m long.
Britten graduated as the first and in a fixed limit and became the first contestant to win 4 grand in American Ninja Warrior, however Caldiero won it for three full seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero provided an interview for newsE! News immediately after his hard-earned victory and it was known that he is still in shock from winning the main prize of $1 million.
"It's a great feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," said Isaac E! in response to my win.
"So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it's going to be like."
The executive producer Kent Weed provided an interview with The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the final and why Britten won't get any reward despite the fact that he became the first competitor to finish the race.
According to the rules, money belongs to those who finish the track as quickly as possible.
"If there are more competitors involved, the win will be won with the best time," Weed said.
Although winning the main win would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he'd be hiding.
He's glad he managed to achieve what he did.
The fans gave him a warm welcome.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
It's a hero for your children and your wife."
Geoff said to me, "If there was someone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue the eighth season, which will start filming in spring 2016.

Xi calls for opening the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world for growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is Tuesday's reform of the regime.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," said the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group to deepen overall reform.
The promotion of opening up in parental reforms adds a new impulse and vitality, it also provides a new space for economic growth, Xi says.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory approaches to the market, the release of border control policies, the support of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and reorganise the registration system.
The declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are outside the investment limits.
This system will gradually be tested and improved through pilot programmes.
This step is important because it gives the market a greater role to allocate resources, ensure the legal environment and make the market more open, the declaration states.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and ensure that companies themselves will decide how to manage their business.
The declaration also states that China will be able to introduce new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new regional growth support mechanisms to the border area.
In an effort to open up the controlled sector, more areas will be opened up by private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies financed from abroad and provide them with better services," the statement states.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent stay or "green card", thanks to the optimization of the requirements and the simplification of the application process.
The exercise and development of the rights of lawyers to practise and develop professional judges and state representatives was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and representatives Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
There may be a new bed room in the state of Karlovars.
According to the Heitman of the Karlovarian Country of Jakub Panika (ČSSD), the current capacity of the bed wards of two national hospitals and two private hospitals in the country should be sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
But there are also ways of expanding care in the country.
For example, in the surgical department, a one-day surgery centre could be established where, according to the established concept, the performance of surgical areas that do not require hospitalization longer than 24 hours would be carried out.
In which specific hospitals should the workplace focus on one-day surgery be, it is not clear yet.
In the skin department of Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser centre could be created with the possibility of using laser technology for skin disease.
The concept also recommended the establishment of an apalic center that would care for patients with brain impairment who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be set up centrally and should be an integral part of the anaesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility into an island hospital where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovarian country, is the subsequent care bed, in particular the long-term treatment of patients (LDN), whose capacity in Nedka is insufficient and above all should be closely monitored for acute care.
Part of this device should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, recommends the concept.
As he points out, the following care beds are missing mainly in Karl Vary's hospital.
There they could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
In the last row in the state of Karlovarian, there is no social health bed with the aim of treating Alzheimer's disease.
These beds are lacking throughout the Republic, so they could also serve for other countries as so-called Alzheimer's Centre.
Hospitals should, as recommended, also prepare for the introduction of so-called bedside beds to which European grants will be released.
"This is about a bed that will go into the areas of specialised care and create room for translation of patients after surgery, for example after cardiosurgical, neurosurgical, transplant or other procedure," the regional concept of bed care describes.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
