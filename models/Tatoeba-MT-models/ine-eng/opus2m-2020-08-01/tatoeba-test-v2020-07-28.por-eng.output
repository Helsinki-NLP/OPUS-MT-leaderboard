I hope Tom hasn't lost the bus.
You should spend a bit of time every day reviewing vocabulary.

I'm sure Tom didn't know Mary was going to Boston this week.
Since then the distinction between the two races, the conqueror or goddess and the Roman or conquered, almost disappeared, and the men of the north had confused themselves with those of the middle-day in one nation, whose greatness would contribute to that with the arduous virtues of the German wilderness, this one with the traditions of Roman culture and police.

It was very difficult to seduce Layla.
Do you use deodorant?
He died for too much work.
Tom probably knows that Mary likes him.
We've got a lot of time.
Tom's on the phone again.
No one's ever been able to get into the room.
Tom remembered something.
I wanted to buy some flowers for Mary.
There's something I want you to do for me.
You're gonna talk to her, Tom.
Tom's father never came home before nine or ten.
He begged his father to buy a bicycle for him.
I got a little more than $5.
I was lucky.
We promise you we will never do that again.
I know it's smart.
Don't go ahead and explain it to me.
This dictionary can also help them.
Among these, there may be new sources of edible fish and new species of other creatures.
I've never been so scared.
I'm ashamed of my mistake.
The patient's condition worsened.
Let's get out of the way!
The truth is, I've never met Tom.
The work of a driver is not as easy as it seems.
You're worse than before?
Tom used to think Mary didn't like him.
Have you chosen the songs you'll play tonight?
I heard Tom's in the hospital.
