Petr Czech: Switching to the last minute?
It's all possible.
Today is the last day when you can still skip the transfer window and make a big break.
Another chance will come in winter.
Petr Chech, currently a replacement dealer for Chelsea, but now he does not sit above a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits at the NH Hotel, talks with Czech journalists and is going to be with the Czech representation for the American game general and then on the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In the Chelsea branch, in the new season Primer League has been privileged by Thibaut Courtois, Czech for the first time in ten years in the London club has become a deputy.
Some time ago it was speculated that he might be interested in the Czech Republic.
In the beginning of the season, the Spanish Super Cup lost in fighting with the Athletics and failed to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
It was also speculated about the interest of Paris SG.
The French league had two wins and two remises in the season, and on Sunday he shot St. Etienne 5:0.
Relatively the most pressing shoe club AS Monaco.
He's got 1-1-2 in the league, and on the weekend he broke up with Lille slowly 1:1.
The news on the Bulgarian English websites today is that the Czechs might want to go to Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, though, Czech departure from Chelsea for the last time is not too likely.
Skybet wrote course 4:1 on him.
Peter, is it possible that you'll change your dress over the rest of the hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything in the football.
Maybe during the day there'll be an offer that won't be able to refuse.
How would such an offer look?
(Laughter) "Well, I still don't know how an offer that can't be rejected actually looks.
It would have to come to the agreement of all parties, especially if Chelsea had decided whether or not to offer the club.
Is it technically feasible to commit such an offence when you are in Prague now?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new office?
I didn't think about it.
But in this situation, there are a lot of players today, all of them are somewhere on the stage, and there's certainly still a lot of crossovers to be closed today.
So somehow feasible it would certainly be.
How many clubs could you afford on the planet?
I don't really know.
So you're not pushing to leave?
The situation where I didn't catch a new season in the first three matches is new to me after fifteen years of my career.
However, there's no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
I want to continue to take part in this fight for Chelsea's position and it's on the coach who chooses which decision he will make over the next few weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I take all the factors into account.
It's important to me, of course, a sports view, but I'm looking at it from the personal page, which of course belongs to the needs of the family.
Is it possible that you could catch another club in England?
That's the question I thought it would never concern me.
But football is all possible.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.

A man will be set before the court for charges of rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was charged with being heard at the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
Supposedly on 7 June 2013 at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in the district of Perthshire to rape a woman.
According to the statement, Webster attacked her, while “she was unconscious, asleep and unable to give her consent.”
In addition, Webster is struggling to rape another woman at the Hotel Golf View in Nairn on the Scottish highlands of 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae has set the date of remand on 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Renewal of a very American ideal that labour rights are at the same time human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law that should be organised in committees to protect as civil law.
"According to how the committees function, there are jobs for the middle class," says Ellison, Democratic Senator for Minnesota, who is co-chair of the Congress Committee.
That is why I am so proud that, together with the model of occasional rights, I can introduce John Lewis a law strengthening the position of employees.
This cross-border legislation provides workers with the same legal option as preventing discrimination in the organisation of committees as in other forms of discrimination - and will stop anti-committee forces
The regulation of the Labour Relations Act in such a way as to enable all employees who face discrimination, if they wish to be involved in the committees, to be tried before the civil court - and to judge compensation or compensation - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it certainly is not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other drafters are proposing in the law is to put on American ideal again.
Despite the trade union struggles that have been taking place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - the Americans have ever supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember when the country, with one breath, advocated democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt the constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their committees played a role in the formation of a new Japan, included in them languages and openly acknowledged that "the right of employees to gather, negotiate collectively and act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged Germany to create a constitution to ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organise and promote in a new nation and therefore included a clause that openly states: “The right to create companies that will ensure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and to every profession or profession.
Agreements which will restrict or attempt to harm this right shall be repealed. Measures leading to the fulfilment of such a purpose shall be unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, President of the International Commission on Human Rights, proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, included the proposers and Roosevelt's guarantee that "everyone has the right to set up and enter the committees within the framework of the protection of his interests."
The whole generation of Americans accepted the basic assumption that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create working committees - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are violated in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that workers must have the right to organise and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Everyone today knows that the nation's forces have not diminished, but they have expanded it.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry, and raised production to an unprecedented level.
Those who attack the councils forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and we shouldn't.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organization of committees - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that raised America and made it a real commitment to democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law, which could have closed all the destroyed clinics in Louisiana.
On Sunday, the federal judge temporarily blocked the Louisian law, which, according to lawyers, was likely to close all five clinics of execution in the state.
The regulation signed by Louisian Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is due to enter into force on 1 September, would require doctors to accept a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge’s ruling means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal damages and must, in the meantime, provide for this authorisation.
"The proposing party will be able to operate legally and in the meantime obtain permission," says Federal Judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more lasting law resolution.
Activists for the right to lose resolution, which is the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said that they would give doctors more time to obtain permission.
"Today's decision ensures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from a law that is to prepare them for health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who, on behalf of three out of five clinics, sought to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerned doctors from two clinics who were not among the complainants, and they also requested that this authorisation be granted.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures to be anti-legislative.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, blocked the federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women's right to perish together with the Association of American Births and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association claim that the need to have this permit puts on a doctor the requirements that are not necessary from a medical point of view.
The victims of the loss denied that the measures were intended to protect women’s health, and some also welcomed the fact that the measures would have closed the clinics.
The Centre for Reproductive Rights has indicated that only one doctor is allowed to suffer loss in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop the execution of the losses, this doctor would also stop the action, the group said, in fear of his safety.
The Louisian authorities have indicated in their response that they would not punish doctors who are losing while waiting for a claim to be filed.
Due to late diagnosis and poor treatment availability, more often the ovaries are killed in rural cancer.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their mother's death on egg cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their ancestors in the city.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
The head of research Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute indicated that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
MALA STUDIE: New medicines can slow lung and egg cancer
Women’s researchers have been following the course of seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chance of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate was observed in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors may be late diagnosis and poor treatment availability.
"Nemoc can best treat gynecooncologists who usually live in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving medical services at a distance to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help to strengthen transport services that allow specialists to treat women close to their homes and programs to support people who are treated far away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of the geographical location, which underlines the need for better treatment and prevention programmes.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer today publishes Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, in her 33 years of age, a young mother, Elisha Neave, from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret a reduction in the number of home owners
According to an HTA study published by the Financial Times, a decrease associated with the extraordinary loss of owners of households under 35 years of age could lead to a "main age groups of gardeners" being reached by today's young generation with up to ten million pounds per year.
According to the report, people who rent their homes lose 55% of the amount lost by people living in their own gardens.
As other dangerous factors in the sector, which makes an estimate of five billion pounds a year, indicate an increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the form of fences instead of fences used as parking areas and reducing the size of the gardens.
In the area of Great London, where the share of owned houses fell over six years from 61% to 43%, they account for one household the lowest expenditure on garden products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society have stated that housing in a basement or lack of space does not mean that people could not plant plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden advisor for RHS, said: “The tenants have a very popular plant growing in flowering - when they move, plants can take along with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the urban retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher proportion of households and economic prosperity lasting from 80 to half of the 1990s.
This year he also predicted a higher return due to better weather conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator speaks of democracy.
After Putin was defeated by his youth organization, which reminds me of all of Hitler's most important things, he has saved us with atomic weapons and has basically revealed to everyone that their opinions are stolen from him, given us today a lecture on democracy.
But I feel that the current regime in Russia is showing a lot of pictures of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be ruled by both drunk nationalism and that the minority complex can be transformed into imperialist chutes.
The time spent on the east is probably different than on the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of war over Europe was long gone , in the east it thought that they had been overlooked for a long time and it was necessary to regain their international position.
Such excitement and frustration ruled in Germany in the thirties, just before the Nazi power was captured, and then followed the explosion of nationalism that is similar to today's situation in Russia.
And then that completely consistent cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is certainly quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and most of the Russians are probably poor after the time when Russia ruled half the world and the second part shook before them.
Perhaps the Western politicians blamed themselves, perhaps little of Vladimir was crying after his shoulder, perhaps not inviting him to where he wished, and perhaps starting to underestimate him, and he was just acting like a typical Russian man.
He made an order at home, he looked like he didn't even want to, and he did his knives at home.
Now he decided he'd get the lost position back.
It's starting slowly, it's time.
The leader's probably on his way to life, so where he'd hurry.
The Kavkasans are now the Ukrainians, and then they're in a row of Pobalti sufferers.
Those Russian bears have been in the skin for a long time.
He's probably going to notice this China that's kind of jumping out of the way, and he's definitely going to be looking for a long way to go.
And these Germans of the Vladimir are also pretty sick of how well they are, and I put it on their ass in 45.
What do you want to do with a new New York in Karl's Varech?
That would be the founder, and ours are a lot there and how they're forced there, and yet they're trying to get the lynchman out of them.
Our veterans are still remembering how they were doing in Czechoslovakia.
Now the vote is their Prime Minister, Mr. Sobotka, who is so soft, he can steal like a brick and sleep their entire EU.
That's how it would play to jump on big Russia.
They need to remember where their place is.
And we will use our cousins who live in their territory as a means of breaking through.
The Russians are everywhere enough and when they say they're printed there, they're just printed there, and we don't let that happen, we protect them.
And then the Russian will rule again, and to what the other is born.
Europe is only good as a proposal on which proud Ivan can dance a goat.
Turkey called for American diplomats for spying news
Turkey's foreign minister called on the country's highest-ranking American diplomat to explain the report of American and British spying activities in Turkey.
The Vice-President of the Government of Bulent said that the American charge d'affaires and the Turkish state officials had acted on the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept stated that according to the documents provided by the former American National Security Agency, Turkey was the priority target of American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been responsible for the report and has declared that all major states are following each other.
An older report, which said that the German news service was also targeted at Ankara, triggered a more bitter reaction from the Turkish government.
Series Game about the throne presented other tricks fourth row
The creators of the Thrones Games are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about the emergence of the fourth row of tricks.
The most visible are computer adjustments of the serial environment and mass scenes, when the army of the famous Daenerys becomes the loudest of soldiers.
Police chief in Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the complainants submitted evidence to the Office of the Mallorian State Prosecutor on the expulsion of police officers and civil servants from the Calvia State Council.
The chief of police in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after charges against the high-ranking businessmen and bar owners in the notorious party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into investigation after he was charged with corruption by several of the companies from Punta Ballen, a street where most of the bars and night companies are located in Magaluf.
According to the Internet newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday, the complainant prosecutors of the Mallorca Office for Corruption have submitted evidence of expulsion from police and state officials in Calvia's self-government area.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police for interfering with the corruption charge and, together with Navarre, a judge was heard.
The Spanish national journal ABC quoted the unsatisfied owners of night-time enterprises as having a significant impact on their business by public factors.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen in the court.
Don't play with our lives.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf got on the top of the magazines all over the world after a video of 18-year-old British tourists appeared on YouTube, who provided oral sex to 24 men during the tour after the bars.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to keep an eye on drunks and marketers in a number of participants in the holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of notorious alcoholic tours by bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where there was an event involving oral sex, was forced to close for a year and, together with tour organizers after the Carnage Bars, to pay a fine of EUR 55,000 (US$ 73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is particularly popular in Britain, was also a witness of many alcohol-affected accidents, including fashion waves known as "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
First winter day marked by rain and storms that had an impact on the airport at Adelaide
JARO brought South Australia an ice surprise, with strong rain and harsh winds that seriously hit Adelaide airport.
Another 5 mm of impact should occur in the city until nine o'clock in the evening and another 6,6 mm will occur during the night of the week.
The last rain came along with a few short surges associated with the storm and the wind blowing that began eight hours ago and brought nearly 4 mm of precipitation within about ten minutes.
After several spring early doses came after winter, temperatures in the city fell again on Monday at only 15.8 °C.
It is estimated that storm weather contributed to the late Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was due to stop at 19:30, but to a short distance it was hit by a change in speed or direction of the wind and was forced to stop.
The wind blowing at Adelaide airport at that time reached the ground speed of about 50 km/h.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to leave the second landing and finally arrived at about 20:40.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently led to the delay of the next years, including the flight of Emirates from Dubai and the flight of Quantas from Sydney.
According to the forecast, they will reach a maximum temperature of 16 °C on Tuesday in Adelaide and may occur one or two exceedances.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas close to the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in counter-defence shelters, while rockets and minomets attacked their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory is being remembered from the battles.
The beginning of the school brought to the community in southern Israel the marked attacks of joy and excitement, but the signs of battle are still visible.
In Ashdod, a town on the south of the country, the school staff who hit the rocket removed the remains from the wall after the strikes, and they expect the return of the children.
"We're a little scared, but otherwise we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a native of Saad, and an English teacher at the local school.
Many children in this area really need to return to their daily routine.
Her eleven-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, discovered that "it's a little strange" to go back to school.
"We had a few difficult moments and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, located near the border with Gaza, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the inhabitants.
Until the ceasefire last week of the war ended, thousands of inhabitants of border settlements such as Saad left their homes or homes and moved to safer areas away from Gaza to avoid missiles and mines.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a village near the border with Gaza, where she shot a four-year-old boy from the Palestinian Minomet, with a return weight.
The Minister of Education said that about 12 families still haven't returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in substitution schools.
The President of the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the border with Gaza, which was severely hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged his children to study diligently, and he added: “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a timeless peace last Tuesday.
The ceasefire, however, led to the immediate end of the fighting, but did not solve key problems such as Hamas' demand for the end of the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the restoration of airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of two soldiers who have fallen into the war.
It is expected that the new round of unfair dealings will begin later this month in Egypt.
According to the estimates of the Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel doubts and estimates that at least half of those killed were radical, although there is no clear evidence for this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including Thai workers, died.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired 4 591 rockets at the Israeli cities in the south and fired from mines.
The Israeli army has again undertaken more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and by the estimate of 250,000 people hid in hundreds of UN schools, which were transformed into provisional shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people who are still hiding, and because of ongoing fights, school officials dropped off last week at the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that the school will soon open up so that we can complete education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school in the largest city in Gaza.
I'm standing behind the watch.
And Lafatu hits the temperature
The Czech football team met this afternoon in Prague in front of the mid-term preparatory match with the US and the next leading match of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Of the three-twenties-member frame, the problem is with the Spartan attacker David Lafat, who is suffering from fever.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David's got a little more problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," Professor Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it is two or three days, or if it is fit tomorrow, it will be seen according to his health status, which our doctor will decide," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course someone has a disease, but it is not such that they could not train or participate in a match in the middle of the United States," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called as the last player of the Spanish treasurer Lukas Vácha.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, considering other middlemen.
I decided that Lucas is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I am behind it," Vrba told Vách.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latata.
It is not excluded that, in the case of health problems, the nomination could still change.
For example, on the weekend with a great performance, a Liberian Josef Shural gave a hattrick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing shape lately.
We'll see how David Lafat is doing.
In the event that it can't be available on Wednesday, I don't claim that I can't name any of the players interested in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon there is a representation of coaches on the Strahov, then on Tuesday the classic pre-accession coach before a duel with the USA on Summer, which will be open for fans and then follow the autograph.
The fight with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for the first victory under the Vrba.
In the previous three preparatory games, he won two remises and lost one.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is then on the 9th of September since 20:45.
Pedestrians go to the Netherlands to Italy
The worm likes to have more time for training than previous strikes.
It is an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice with them certain things that we may not have had much time before.
Now we will be able to focus only on getting ready for the Netherlands as best we can," Vrba praised himself.
The Dutch will present themselves before the victory in Prague on Thursday in Italy and the duel will personally monitor the former temporary representative viewer Josef Pešice.
He's giving us information that's from the fight.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have a fight and we're gonna have a fight and we're gonna figure it out.
There's a new coach coming to the Netherlands, we'll see what changes they'll make there," Vrba told bronze medalists from a recent world championship.
According to the very monitored statistics, the prices of the apartments in the winter period have grown by a maximum of seven years.
According to the housing value index in the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic grew by 1,1 % in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to a total increase of 4,2 % in June, June and August, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 %, more than double the one year to August 2013, but profit was not equally distributed in the country.
The RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless stated that Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
RP Data shows that the prices of apartments in Sydney increased by 16,1 % last year, while prices in Melbourne by 11,7 %.
Among the most powerful markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with an average price increase of between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale, Canberra, which was damaged by the state-owned cost reduction and where prices increased by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that when spring began, the number of properties for sale will increase in the following months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"In view of the ongoing high level of auction sales, overall high sales speed and low interest rates, the value of housing is likely to increase over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never told me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father who died when Henry was 19, who worked in the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry is testing comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father, which is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melodies is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After her mother died, Henry went through "deep" therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have heard his voice saying: “Stop being afraid.
Leave the sister alone.
Get out of here!
I want to look at the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were already grown - went to the bar with him and talked about things like the shape of a glass of beer or the beauty of a cricket hit.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life was a real guy in a corner reading the paper.
Henry had recently visited Dudley's gym, and although conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked at what life must have been like for him.
There's more light there today, but it's still a dark, smoked, cloudy labyrinth where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and sweat.
Dad always went into the bathroom and just lay there, and then it was to hear how slowly he began to sing for himself, because he was cleaning up the elevator.
When I went around, I realized that he was doing these years to enjoy his family, and I started to respect him more.
Even so, Henry survived childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anybody, didn't say "I love you."
When Mom was sick and died, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter, Billie, who has Dawn French, made it possible for him to enjoy the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop with that "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
It's a great mom.
With French who was married for 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had sugar.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of overweight and started showing signs of sugar, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to the big fitness center and I also had to keep a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And pregnant.
No one wants to eat the carrot itself.
Changes in Henry’s career may reflect his elegant, short - cut beard.
After receiving recognition from his criticism of Othell, he fell into the theater.
Comedy followed the wrongs and August Wilson's plot.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him on the stage of someone's parade, and wrote about him in the talent competition of New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-70s: “I’ve been the only black copyist/comika on television for a long time.”
He learned to walk.
Besides having to notice the public, I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how to invent working jokes, to be a star and to play on television, and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the right to make the show The Black and White Minstrel Show, the entertainment program in which the players dressed as blacks, Henry finally appeared in his comedy for five years.
My family was already married for that.
I wish it never happened, but I don't like it.
Even though it was a special and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the dam.
What was "years and years appreciated was the main product of British television", but was also "the grand parody of blacks".
In the 1980 ’ s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and presented figures that at the same time made fun of and celebrated British Black Culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began to be broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was among others known as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy show Chef!
For decades, he received advertisements, documents, television shows and roles in films, but after sending his Lenny Henry.tv to BBC in 2008, he said, "What you're going to do now, Lene, seems a little bit like you're stuck in one place or you're getting a little out of the way."
Next in line was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first one was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't really teach him at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of that.
All those with whom we had an interview, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get used to it when you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all like Shakespeare.
Henry presented for the document twenty lines from Othello's final speech and was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it's giving me the courage.
“It’s about it. It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the trial was tough and I've been reading the game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
Looks like they're waiting for a breakthrough that didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in Comedy full of mistakes.
I was in the National Theatre all of a sudden, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for entertaining the audience.
“The voice in my head said, ‘Before the computer corrects, you have to have them for ten minutes now.’”
Instead, the director announced that the presentation would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can fix it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plotech in the Dutch Theatre
Learning the Plot text was a challenge.
Panic's pretty good, he's making a decision.
The game was also well accepted, so it's like God's sign that says, "You should do this."
Of course he says it in a loud voice.
So I'm staying.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the experiment.
Henry, however, remains a comedian's brain - throughout our conversation interrupts with humor when he comes in and out of the role of the simulator.
I decided not to make stand-ups, because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get to the blind alley.
Sometimes, if I want, I do live at the Apollo, but I don't like it like before.
I was wondering if he'd ever set up a stand-up tour.
The pleasure of sitting in one room with a director who helps to give the pictures of the beginning, the means and the end of the journey - I don't think I would ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm having fun with the acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers state officials to be able to shed light on non-existent employees
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all its state officials in order to try to remove from the payment list of the government's non-employee.
According to the Government's declaration, employees who do not register for the next two weeks will cease to receive payment.
The government is of the opinion that thousands of people are paid even after the state service has left.
After the office was arrested in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to ban corruption in the state administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the State comes monthly at least one million dollars (700,000 pounds) for payments to non-existing employees and other abuses of official power.
The government suspects that payments are still put into bank accounts even after the death of the employee or after the employee leaves the state administration, the BBC reporter from Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri, reported.
All state officials must be brought to the identification centres for which their data are biometrically recorded within the next two weeks shall be indicated in the government declaration.
It goes on to say that anyone who doesn't leave without enough excuse will be removed from the payroll.
"By providing real public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its management and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government, and will solve the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waigru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested for "fighting" against the government
Local media reports that 33 police officers were detained in Turkey due to suspicion of "inciting against the government".
The police were still not commenting on the case.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, fourteen highly established officials were detained.
Some of them were involved in the December investigation of corruption, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and telephone interrogation.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then the President of the Government) marked their conversation as part of the action of Islamic spiritual fethullah Gulen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and the president of the government of Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he informed present journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that it was decided to defend the country for the next generation:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on Tuesday.
Not all of Ukraine is peace.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, a united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukov, a teacher at the school in Slavjanska, visited Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain the knowledge that will benefit them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing fancy shirts, bringing balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, maybe the BBC found the boss for a hard time
The cloud of fame from the banking world, the media of management and the internal conclusion of the conservative party.
Sam has experience from the front lines.
She began her career in the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearsons media.
She was the executive director of the Financial Times for seven years. She resigned when her youngest colleague, Pearson's, held the highest position in the parent company.
It's said that her retreat was close to a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended to Lord Browne, former director of BP when Cameron in Whitehall needed a private expertise: she became a adviser to the government.
Her husband is a former member of the City Council.
In May, I described the director's work as a poison kale.
Not only is BBC a vast and complex entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns to two directions: inside to the top layer of the hierarchy of its own BBC management, but also outside to the public's voice in times of unrest when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that asks for a thorough reform.
Which director, however, would risk coming to a company complex as a Chinese dynasty, disposing of it and preparing itself for work.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see how the BBC decreases -- its power, its finances -- and how its status is revised.
With the expansion of the competition circle and new technology questioning old certainty, the immediate negotiation of concessionary fees for the BBC is a major threat.
For a modest amount of 145.50 pounds a year, the British public buys a share in something that is probably the largest media company in the world.
The BBC will tell a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of the household and that each one is only 40 pence a day.
In addition, the BBC format is clearly up to 53% of beneficiaries compared to 31% ten years ago.
BBC service usage models have changed: Today I have news headlines displayed on my mobile phone and on the series I visited, I can look at iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very loving and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims the insulting tweet didn't approve
Tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained an insulting image of a democratic state representative who initiated Perry's criminal charge of abuse of power.
Tweet was later reduced and another one was published on Perry's account, which was distanced from the previous one.
He left my account with a tweet that was not authorized.
"I did not agree with the tweet and I picked it up," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although tweets have been sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published an unscrupulous, humorous picture of the representative of Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay off the funds for her office, which Perry, a potential candidate for the president in the 2016 elections, brought this month before a large jury in Austin.
The tweet stated: “I don’t always drive three times the level of alcohol in the blood than the limit is allowed... but if so, I regret that Governor Perry is calling me to be responsible for this.”
I'm the most vulnerable democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by the Lehmberg Authority.
He was raised by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent, and he called the charge a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team requested a judge in charge of rejecting the charge because the application of the laws to appeal to the most senior government in Texas history is anti-legislative.
Perry interrupted the payout of $7.5 million from the State Fund for the Division of Public Interest, which has a seat in Travis County, and is complaining of corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection resulted in a formal complaint from a left-wing group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it's celebrated.
After in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, at the fifth place in his committee, Perry replied to the speculation that he could end up tweeting his own photo, running near the lake, and saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market returns “to normal”
One of the most prominent London development companies warned that the housing market in southeastern England had "returned" to normal activity.
Housing in the capital was the subject of high demand and rising prices and increased concerns from the credit bubble led to the introduction of mortgage limits in June of England.
Tony Pidgley, founder and president of the Berkeley Development Company, said on Monday: "The market from the top point of the current budget year has returned to the normal level of the transaction." He adds that it provides a "stable environment for operation".
The London housing market was successful during the decline, as buyers from abroad were flooded into the main city.
According to the disaster data, only last year the price in the city jumped by 18,5 %, with an average of 6,7 % in England and Wales.
The average selling prices of private, affordable and student accommodation from Berkeley rose by about five last year and by the end of April they had risen to 423,000 pounds.
However, because of the increasing books, it has not been so attractive for foreign buyers of London's property in recent months - some of them have also threatened the introduction of new real estate taxes and the possible "storage taxes" with which policies came before the parliamentary elections next May.
London’s real estate office Foxtons warned last week that the April review of the mortgage market, which presented more stringent loan rules, would also slow down the rate of market growth during the second half of the year in the sale of properties and prices.
The new Bank of England data showed a decrease on Monday in the number of approved mortgages in July, suggesting that the housing market is being calmed down.
Hamptons International, another real estate office, reduced on the basis that home prices have already begun to decline, its forecast growth of London real estate prices for 2015 to 3%.
The volume of transactions according to the real-time WA Ellis office between London's most expensive districts such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington fell by a quarter each year.
However, the demand for housing in Berkeley's capital was a blessing because it increased cash for forward sales to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, good-looking accommodation in the right location remained the same and this kept the forward sale.”
In June, the company announced that it sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the end of the crisis in 2007.
The annual income before taxation increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, by 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday before the annual meeting of Pidgley, it was expected that Berkeley's annual earnings would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be 450 million pounds.
Berkeley's stock stopped at the London Stock Exchange on 23.96 pounds this afternoon.
Hacker on the Internet posted photos of Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Cen Academy.
Photos by Oscar Jennifer Lawrence have escaped on the Internet because of a hacker who claimed to have “list” photos of another hundred starting actors.
The "Hunger Games" film star confirmed that the photos of Lawrence are real and hacker criticised for "evident breach of privacy."
The authorities have already been contacted and will complain to anyone who steals photos of Jennifer Lawrence's public.
Hacker photos that were originally published on the 4chan image sharing server were reportedly obtained thanks to the gap in the Apple iCloud internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes dozens of stars including Rihanny, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, however, the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World" Winstead also criticised on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who are looking through the photos we had with your husband years ago in private homes are satisfied with themselves," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known as Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious" cable TV series, however, denied that the photos would be true. On Twitter she said: "These my alleged naked photos are PODVRH, people."
It's better to swallow it even in a mess.
Buzzfeed announced Sunday night that the speaker of the Ariana Grande pop stars denied that the alleged photographs were true.
Extraordinary sample of Howard Jacobson's newly-educated novel about love and letter "J"
They got divorced, it's the best way to describe it, they're gradually spreading out like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
From time to time, a woman told him that she was too serious, complicated, stiff, isolated, and perhaps a little polite.
And then she shakes his hand.
He just let himself go.
He could smell like a goat, yeah.
The last victim of his ability was the beginning of a loving mother - in - law, who more than usual promised to relieve him of the loneliness of life and may even provide him with some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild warmth of hair and a passing heart from the village on the north island, which was even more distant and less hospitable than Port Reuben.
She came up with an older company that Kevern thought was her aunt who inherited property in a wet, but beautiful valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for a few years.
The pipes were asking, there were dead spiders in the bathtubs, the pencils were signed on windows, as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was huge, and the pleave remembered the huge heads of the wanted.
The house looked like a chaloupe from children's stories, scary and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations at the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
Worse choice will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailin sat on their long grass and held their hands, enjoyed an unexpected warm spring afternoon, were caught by the public station, which the country was supplying with comforting music and soothing news, in which he was reminded of the old song of a long forgotten Montenegrin comic that his father loved to listen to the hidden rollers.
You've got too big legs.
Because of their natural aggression, such songs were no longer played on the radio.
They weren't forbidden - really forbidden was nothing - they just didn't play.
They helped them to get to desuetude, as well as the word desuetude itself.
People's taste has proved what they would never have been able to do without the law, and just like people with books, they choose memoirs in which the poor become rich, cooks and lovers of novels, so they choose ballads in music.
Kavern let himself get out of the day and started playing on the imaginary piano and a rough, comical voice singing the show with Aillin's big feet.
Ain't got no idea.
"It was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said, and automatically added two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to push his letter before he got out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he was playing the game with his father.
When you were with the words that started on it, they didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth, it was your pen.
It wasn't too funny and it wasn't funny anymore.
He just knew he was expecting it, that's all.
He must have explained what jazz is.
Ailinn never heard of it.
Not even jazz, even though it wasn't directly built out of law, they didn't play.
The improvisation came out of fashion.
There was only one place in life for one "if."
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where she was going to end up.
The same in humour.
His unpredictability went to people's nerves.
And jazz was a humorous song.
Although he hasn't heard of Sammy Davis Junior for up to ten years, Kevern knew jazz from his father's seminal collection of old CDs.
At least Alilin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she could not remember the time when her favorite singers were not black.
Even without laws or pressure.
A voluntary society is such that every part of it is grateful - thanks to those who have been fortunately saved - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of afro-Caribbean origin with temperaments and constitutions threw for entertainment and athletics, and so sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if a natural gift for electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family would be without a functional phone.
The Poles that remained were the installers, the Greeks that remained, they were wrong.
Those of the states of the Persian Gulf and Levant, whose ancestors did not leave the country quickly, while it was what was done, CO SE STALO, KDYBY SE STALO - feared that they would be accused of adding to the fire, in fact afraid that the fire would consume them the next time - opened their restaurants, where they were selling wells and smoking water smokes, did not notice themselves and the inaction slowly fed them.
To each according to his talent.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailin found it hard to understand how music could occur from the plain words Kavern just sang to her.
Music was the expression of love.
"They're not really free," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden provided illusions of security.
A word could not be avoided behind the soundtracks.
Ailin still doesn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He meant it was a joke, but he managed to put two fingers in her mouth again in her presence.
She thought it was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he finally said.
Unbelievably she shook her head and obscured Kevern's view.
There was nothing else in the whole world but the garbage of her hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said dubiously.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
She didn't go so far.
Maybe a little bit of angle...
You're saying you hate me because I have too thick corners?
Do I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat earrings are just attracting me," he tried.
I'm so kind.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he lost the magic needed to be able to reduce the cruelty he was screaming about.
Maybe his father was cruelly intentional.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel to Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailin's Solomon's line and she got up out of bed, she got on the radio and she blew up the unscrupulous wine.
No wine, so he couldn't drink for it.
She looked like she was shaking herself like a palm leaf in a storm.
"I'm embarrassed that you're a fool," she said...
Except it doesn't touch me.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for her fear in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did you think she'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but she didn't doubt that it was the same as it was here.
The same broad and icy ocean was shaking at them.
The same veiling of men, then CO SE STALO, even more unscrupulous and hateful than their ancestors, pastors and cassavas, were angryly blooming from the house to the house, ready to stretch hands on any woman who would weigh them down or mock them.
Stupid?
If he doesn't pay attention, they'll take his toes!
First of all, it became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antidote of blue ballads about the love that the radio has spattered - first of all, it has been anointed and then one of hers killed.
Kever's opinion is that too much cultivation, because anointing was about itself an act of violence.
Ailin's Solomons literally told him to leave.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt freezing herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She watched him leave - as if she was watching him from the window on the floor - the man who realized what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart went out because of him and for all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them had killed her.
The man turned away from her, shoulder tied, humiliated, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she feel that this look knew well, even though she could not afford one moment until today that she would ever see it?
Ailin Solomons, alone, looked at her feet.
Approximately 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 20-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, the non-statutory monitoring system of the Public Award, prepared a short article on the survival of light and medium-sized violent acts in the areas of the country where its calming or direct suspension was expected to have enough money and energy for its removal.
"It has done so much and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to calm down the native aggression of people who have fought in many battles and won most of them, and this is especially in busy, hard-to-access places in countries where even through the peaks of church towers coming out of the living areas of human kindness, historically only rarely appeared."
Some things, however, are irrevocable.
The higher the church tower, the lower the puddles.
The residents are breathing over sentimental arguments, suffocating unhappy stories and declaring that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas old brutality is held as hard as in urban agglomerations, but also evidence shows that at home, in the workplace, roads and even in sports games, there is new and aggressive intolerance.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too flowery," said her supervisor.
I'd suggest you read less novels.
We've got Nussbaum's head off.
I also have to ask myself: Are you an atheist?
"I think I don't have to answer," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
We have regained our right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
"I am not asking for this," said Rabinowitz, "that I have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have any predestinations at this office.
We serve unaccompanied companies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which is completely acceptable and commendable to itself, can sometimes reflect the judgment as you have suggested.
Obviously you yourself are bound to the Church - things you call "hard" and "brutish" could also interpret them as expressions of natural power and energy.
To still solve CO SE STALO, KDYBY SE SALO IT STALO, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
At his head on the pink light table, he saw recommendations from Ofnow that he had sent to the world in the last quarter or more.
Smile about your neighbor, watch your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the music, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
It's better to talk than to keep quiet, the song word is better than written, but there's nothing better than love.
"I fully understand your allowances," replied the silent Esme Nussbaum, when she was sure that her superior had ended, "and I no longer claim that the morning was not as good as we think it was.
My main concern is that if we are not warned about this, we repeat the same mistake that led to the CO SE STALO, KDYBY SE STALO.
This time, however, we will not fan the rest of our lives.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the fingertips.
That was supposed to mean endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you describe the steps that may have been taken and may not have been done to your ancestors.
You're far too far away from being talking about ventilating your "sense" and "infidelity" to "other".
I should not remind anyone in your place that we are not talking about "us" and "them" in the understanding of the past and in the protection of our presence.
There were no "we" and there were no "them".
All we know is that it was a chaotic time.
“In the course of which, if we are honest with ourselves,” Esme took courage, “we are not without guilt.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this together.
And just as there is no guilt that could lead to someone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the remedy is appropriate and possible.
But to what is the past better than to learn from it?
There's a past to forget about.
If I can add anything to that--
Luther Rabinowitz unplugged his fingertips.
"I will take your message into account," he said and missed it.
The day when she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hired a walker in a way that was described as “brut and cruel. ”
Accidents happen.
The army of the Lesothe Kingdom claims that there is no way to plan - the government's president remains in South Africa
Military officials of the Lesotho Kingdom objected to organizing a coup for the purpose of overthrowing the government, and claimed to have acted against the police suspects in an attempt to arm the political fanatics.
The president of the government, Thomas Thabane, fled the country and said that the army surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maser.
After he said he was in danger of death, the prime minister moved his family to the neighboring South African Republic.
Speaking Army Major Ntle Ntoi said it wasn't really a cop, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics", which the police were trying to arm.
"This morning the command of the defence components of the Kingdom of Lesotha acted after receiving several reports of the information service that there are several groups in the ranks of police who are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who are going to get fired in the country," said the Voice of America.
The South African government spokesperson Clayson Monyela said military action seemed like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that the government has taken power by force, according to all, the actions of the Lesotho defence components are a sign of coup d'état," he said.
The military representatives of the kingdom of Lesotho said that the soldiers returned to their wives ’ rooms on Sunday and were at peace in the capital city.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mohetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said in his opinion it was just an attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane has suspended Parliament's session due to internal disputes, Lesotho has been in tension.
He claimed that despite his false claims, he did not undermine his government's conduct.
Production in the euro area is at a minimum of thirteen months
Growth in production was reduced to a minimum of thirteen months, according to a carefully monitored survey in August in the euro area.
The final euro area purchasing manager index (PMI) from June 51.8 fell to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 means expansion.
New orders have been issued and the factory has damaged the growing tension between the EU and Russia for Ukraine.
The figures come from a quarterly meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the remote eurozone recovery and the risk of inflation falling to 0,3 %.
Speculation has been expressed that the Director of the ECB, Mario Draghi, may have indicated this week that he is considering the quantitative release of the eurozone, similar to that of the United Kingdom and the USA during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than any growth, the slow effect of the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the producer is still more visible," said Rob Dobson, the leading economist of Markit.
Germany’s production of SMEs, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a minimum of 11 months of 51.4.
In the second largest economic zone, France, SMEs fell to 46.9.
Concern about France prevails, Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared are not too soothing," Dobson said.
The slowdown of the industry is likely to pour oil into fire analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where SMEs grew to 57,3 at the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, a leading economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing that can be said about the production overview of buyers in August is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
Added: The eurozone producers currently have a very complex life because increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add even more uncertainty to the ever-voluntarily demanding conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty of trade has become evident - and above all the confidence of consumers, which is likely to lead to some orders being postponed or even cancelled, especially those that are costly.
He said that as "more likely" it appears that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative release, "though we expect it to be limited".
Ten Years of Hell of Beslan: Ten Years of Fear From an Incapacitated School Children Still Suffering
Ten years ago, thousands of people were held hostage by Czech radicals at the school in Beslana in southern Russia
During the suffering that lasted three days and the world was shocked, more than 330 people were killed, of whom more than half were children.
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the animal school.
Just ten years after the terrible siege of the school in Beslan, where 334 people including 186 children were killed, the surviving heroes warned yesterday before the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatic terrorists and children and parents were captured and killed, it seemed like the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to the tragedy brought the East and the West together, which in this catastrophic accident led to a conversation and a future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the animal school.
We have found wonderful young people who have suffered misfortunes, even though the memory of hell-caused terrorists will live on in them.
What's their greatest wish?
That the war that now destroys Ukraine -- and the children like them die -- is over.
A girl trying to get back into a destroyed school gym
She was caught by a leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, only trying to get back into the bombed school gym after the bomb exploded in her underwear.
Disturbed Aida desperately was looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
They were afraid they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"Some woman told me to run away and save my life, but I couldn't," said Aida once.
I had my legs from the blood.
I got up and came back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After a few operations, she thought she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said: “The pain came back three months ago.
I'm afraid I'll have to do another surgery.
There's a piece of strip left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said decisively.
“It just happened to me and it can’t change.
I'm going to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise we're trying not to talk to friends about it.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future partner of the Jerry Gapoev class were killed there.
As a kid, we played together and we imagined how we'd go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about the hug, but she remembers a little pale every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet, as I walk through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and stop it from happening again.
A boy who avoided the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia children start school in seven years) and survived the school's classroom siege in the embrace of his mother, Tamara.
At that time, seven years later, she said: “My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie on the ground and hold her by the hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said, "Get out of here."
He was afraid she was dead, ran away, and saw a crying battalion, grabbed the child by the hand, and ran away with a spray ball.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me his mother was dead."
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was on her way to freedom and was in the hospital with an injured leg and thought that her son had died.
After they met again, she said: “I cried happily.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and he hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to missing news of the World), where then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were declared winner of Bernardo's Children.
"The horror is coming back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that memories are already blank.
I remember throwing all my guns into the game right after.
But today I can play computer games where they shoot, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I was playing with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or they died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
For a trip to London I remember well, especially how I could choose anything I wanted in the playground and how I went on a convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine where he and his friends suffer from war.
The horror is coming back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am very sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror," says Damir, who took part in voluntary activities in the monastery last week.
I want a lot of help.
Once I want to work with the police, and I hope they'll take me to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “You killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember it quietly after the attack, there were no children here who would scream and run, and it took a few months.
She lives on the road with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her funding for the award and for being able to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember how Damir had a taste for the toast, and then they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them out of the water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And it's only been a month since the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and support.
She said: “I still think that the world has not changed for the better in those ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, every day people die, and I think it was and will still be killed by a lot of kids.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for many people, war is just something in the news they hear when they're bored or while doing something else.
I know what these people are experiencing, what they're afraid of.
I still feel it.
Nothing's changed. People still want to kill each other. It's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice and quiet boy, he's not at all aggressive or stubborn.
For example, he doesn't complain about revenge, he doesn't care about this at all.
I know she doesn't like to remember that, but she's very close to six partners and she goes to the gym every now and then and then they light candles.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember how he used to lie on a couch with his face turned away from us, and sometimes he used to lie down for hours.
He didn't sleep. He had his eyes open.
I also remember that he threw all his guns or other weapons at play. Damir today is 17, he's taller than me, nice, smart and healthy.
It's hard to believe that I've been certain for several hours that he's dead and I'll never see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw that hell, there were pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my boyfriend didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember shouting, “Damira, run away, run away!” but I was convinced that he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives are different from others.
Grigory Ilyn, 17
The boy whose photograph was taken after the attack became a symbol of terror in Beslan
Comfort: Survived by Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, right Grigory today
When he fled for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his associates, he was terrified in his bloodthirsty face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the beast in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists knocked on the door, so my boy stayed there for three days alone," she recalled.
Not entirely because we had relatives there, but everyone died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it is increasingly difficult to think and talk about it.
It won't even happen one day so we don't remember the tragedy.
We don't think it's happened a long time ago. I feel like it was yesterday.
I promise that no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Photo Grigorie (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated as a shocha (right)
I remember Grigory, who was so excited about school that day, said he wanted to include his teacher.
That he's alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of Grigory in San Marino.
Grigory's looking at the picture, and we have her hidden in the library at home.
I understand, but I also think that this image makes people all over the world know what pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
“I doubt we will ever learn the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the Boeing accident in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what was the reason?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening because when you ask people, no one wants war, so how is it possible?
There's nothing wrong with this pain for ten years.
For us to forget a little bit, it takes decades.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years ago, I had a nightmare attack, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and associates who were killed.
That's why, when September 1 comes, I'm going to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of a childhood friend.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim. This is a story from the past.
I won't forget it, but I won't.
My life is going on.
This year I graduated from school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiosurgeon.
At first, I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't for health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Gregory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was held by a killer's foot
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a killer terrorist during the attack, yet he was able to survive
When he was attacked in full-flow, he was arrested in a gym, sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a killer.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems to us as if it were yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injury he suffered during the attack, he did not.
It's still with me. It's not something I've been throwing at my head.
Now I'm older and it's said that kids with bad experiences can do better - I have to say it's not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and then I was a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - year after - it was the first and last thing I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'll never go back there and please don't want me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on the notebook with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
This pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me at school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful on my knees, which I've been early in life, but I'm already walking normally.
But I couldn't get in and study at the FBS Academy in Petrograd as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they told me it's not possible.
My other bites are animals, so I went to the vet.
I made it the second year.
Learn how to treat all animals from the "cat after cow".
He said: “I know that I will never explain it to my children.
It's not something kids should know about, and it's not something they should even enjoy.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “The pain will still be here.
He's inside and he's getting worse with his next anniversary.
I'm participating in the commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigory's not going.
It must be even stronger for him because he was different from me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory's grown-up today, but the fear goes on.
It's hard to accept when something so awfully unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He did several operations, he could walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say that's how 50% of the fear he's overcome, but to overcome it completely and not forget it.
This terrible experience will be with us all the time.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors were killed, and it only exacerbates the pain.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could have given me, but it hurts me to lose the dead.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who have not remarried.
It's hard to assume that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what's going on in the world -- wars in other places.
What are people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could just pick up all those rebels and throw them away, how long will it take?
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who took into security a special team
Saved: Alyon Tskaev brings to the safe Russian special team (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't even remember the tragedy.
The world in 2004 was breathing when it took little Alyon out of the hands of a Russian police officer from Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but they left her 30-year-old mother, Kristina's ten-year-old sister, and Brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, who was then three years old, escaped, Alyon's mother and sister died at the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and with his new wife, Lighted, they have a little girl named after a dead daughter named Kristina.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, doesn't remember the attack at all and grew up out of her bright and happy girl.
A close friend said that “it’s a great happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids.”
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep the children away from the memories he reminds us of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips how to order better photos and videos under the water
If you are interested in photoning or underwater shooting, you have a wide selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these photos to a family celebration of several photographers, all of them worth less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but to achieve the best results, there are several rules.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are securely closed.
Next set the camera depending on the type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras and cameras have a staged or film mode that optimizes exposure to the dark environment under water.
And before you go into it, find out how deep you can get with your equipment.
Some cameras are only designed for up to 5 feet, another up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluating digital cameras in the usual and watertight performance.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them won't work out.
Compact cameras have LCDs that will help you with composite photos, but the outdoors don't have it.
Even if you have LCD, it's going to look bad under the water and the composition of the collection will be unpredictable.
So always do more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with a slightly different lens of the exposure, use it.
Stay close to the ice.
With deeper light, the light is striking.
If possible, stay in the pool, lake or sea close to the level.
This will also allow you to capture more light on photos - the deeper you sink, the less color you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
It's a great advice if you take a picture of the drought, but it's even more important under the water because of the darker light.
It is especially important if you film with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a solid and wide angle of the finger, which means that if you want to fill the photo box, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality strength was able to change things even in such a huge organization as NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to helping the sick get away from the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife remembers that one of the people who sought his help was an officer of MI6, who had to live with the consequences of the torture that had frozen him.
Lawson understood that while doctors concentrate on diagnosis and disease, patients treated in the blood mostly care for something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of this year.
I felt powerless.
He was confronted with the symptoms of the flu and found that he was impatient and his wife, Juliet, was involved in surgery.
He said, "I want it all done before later."
When Juliet went on a service trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and unexplained.
Something was wrong.
His colleague made him an X-ray of the chest.
One week ago, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came.
He had a mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the cervix or if it has a lung rash.
In most cancers, it is difficult to determine what was their cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer smoke.
But the mesothelis are different.
In almost every case, it is the cause of asbestos exposure - a construction fiber material that was previously referred to as "miracle", but today it is known that it is mortally dangerous.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore mesothelis.
asbestos, finally, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when it entered into force the ban on the use of asbestos in industry.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulators, builders, treasurers, and shipyard workers.
Toxin used in the industry in another era today is difficult to show as a cause for concern.
Such self-esteem, but it's not in place.
As it turns out, in Britain today, the mesothelioma epidemic is over.
The number of deaths on mesothelis is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year are twice the number of car accidents.
Number of deaths due to mesothelioma annually since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in Britain
The reason why we feel its effects right now, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were finally prohibited by law in 1999), is that it usually lasts for several decades before the mesothelis develop.
The mesothelioma plague is not limited to the veterans of the construction industry.
asbestos has been, and in many cases it is still present in homes where we live, in offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in shops where we buy.
So Mesothelis does not respect social order, wealth, reputation, or age.
The privileged gardens from London’s commercial homes after public schools do not provide cover.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where we should be treated are the sources of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even put in isolation.
He was trying to find out where he could get into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the underground steps of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All - students, sisters, doctors and doorkeepers - the walkers used.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question he was able to answer in part.
"For four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital and who then appeared to mesothelis in the last five years," he noted in his letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
Surviving this diagnosis is not uncommon for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can just repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are sick with the same disease?"
According to former British expert on Professor Julian Pete's mesothelimus, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is happening, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that he will die in this way.
asbestos work in Quebec, Canada
In a case-by-case review of the records of the courts, which often turn around and require compensation, the extent to which the meso-teliomic stockpiles have spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted that she exhibited asbestos to Janice Allen out of concern.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she watched two sales in the clothing section - one of the places was a ship of the company, a store on Oxford Street.
Allen's was only 18 when M&S started working.
Today she has two children, over twenty.
“I’ve never heard of mesothelioma before before,” she says, “I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I've never even thought he might have anything to do with me in my sleep.
There's not a lot of people who know about asbestos.
Actually, asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name was given thanks to its fibrosis structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in construction.
The most common is today in buildings, it is possible to find chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boilers and even in brake lining.
He is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, however, the EU and WHO consider him "high health risk", which could lead to death.
More dangerous, but it's brown asbestos and blue asbestos (crokydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of lead asbestos, and experts say that “there is convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high presence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom].”
Employers Marsk & Spencer were asbestos exhibited in a flag shop at Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pete's work suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients states that “a substantial part of the cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exposure is caused by the "normal use and increase" of buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government do not have to think that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report stating that service lifts and pipes in the parliamentary committee are contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be damaged by something as harmless as "strong airflow".
Ministers are often accused of taking care only of their own interests, but in this case it can be the truth.
Although Parliament's Services Directorate has insisted that the Westminster Palace receive "good medical certificates", it now counts that it will take one million pounds and several years of work to be carefully reviewed, modernised and removed asbestos, and that, after the 2015 elections, Members will sit more than on green grasses in Westminster in the areas of the Queen of Algeria II Conference Centre.
The Goddard report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations."
It's not possible to say that this inconsistency will lead to life.
Now everyone can just wait.
One person who was never able to determine when they had asbestos exposure is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos at work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was proven," she says, "but in my case I cannot prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked, and when he worked there.
But of course he remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when something hit him like a cold.
He was 45, he was evening and he was right in the middle of the operation.
All of a sudden, I broke up.
It's been a while.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd get the car home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain came from the womb, the rash around the lungs.
But just like Janice Allen, he had no reason to think it was mesothelis.
He finally spent the month at home.
The confused doctors made him an X-ray of his chest and introduced him a chest catheter to remove the fluid they sent to his lungs.
They haven't diagnosed yet.
His condition improved slowly and he went back to work.
From time to time, though, his symptoms returned, often after he practiced and breathed.
In 2011, one of the Abbott patients with similar symptoms came to the operating room and was subsequently diagnosed with mesotheli.
Not even then, however, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and got into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray images with an expert panel.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he had a probe equipped with a camera inserted between the chest dutine and the lung.
I'm optimistic.
I tend not to take too much," he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry too much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy came between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was mesotheli."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott started meeting with the Macmillan charity sisters and one of them advised him to contact the lawyer.
At this point, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It has been shown that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos heat insulation in the pipe," he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to develop disease.
Thus, mesothelim is now beginning to concern younger people who do not have a risk call.
The most dangerous tubers of heat-insulated asbestos were found in hospitals in the basement, so it was unlikely that patients would be in danger.
However, members of staff who walked underground between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground restaurants (such as Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, decades after the war, the hospital was a place where patients could save their lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who had treated them.
The asbestos is being removed today.
The disciples of Bunsen's Kahan built themselves on asbestos floors
And it's not just a hospital.
asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and councillors because of its excellent insulation and non-inflammatory properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless hours, the chemistry students built a Bunsen kahan on the asbestos floor.
Web sites dealing with asbestos in schools have emerged.
Injurious things like floor tiles or roof coverings on tools in our homes usually contained asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison built into a large number of homes," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could recall in the 1970 ’ s when fighting a garden home.
So be careful how you fight the garden home.
Knowing that the disease is untreated, the effect of diagnosis is huge.
"It takes a while for you," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found out I can't focus on what I'm doing.
I've been in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I was going to have to leave and settle for myself.
Well, I don't have another Christmas.
One of the most serious things was the transition from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As an infinite number of patients before him, he also remembers how he felt confused about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have left?"
I was told 12 months ago.
I remember saying: “Well, I don’t have another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelim is particularly destructive, because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive -- breathing itself -- is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos exposure.
The asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks and the fibers breathe, they can sit in the womb, the lungs.
The asbestos fibers in the cervix and they can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is that they are inhaled asbestos fibers in the form of needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who went to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is a paradoxical center for mesothelioma treatment.
Treasure Lawson also knows and treats other patients who have been exposed to asbestos during practice in the hospital.
Asbestos go into the fabric of the lungs, says Treasure, and “a lonely breath is pushing on the edge of where the exhibitor is.
His character is invasive from the very beginning.
In mesothelioma, the usual treatment options used for other types of cancer are not so high.
The fire is discussed, for example, on the effectiveness of the operation.
According to some, it would be a trial.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the garbage," he says.
You won't get any scalpel around her.
Cancer "does not correspond too much to chemotherapy", which does "have any effect", but does not treat it.
"Sometimes there will be someone who survives lung cancer," Treasure says.
But in the end, everyone dies.
Fortunately, some patients live a long time longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After finding mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counsellor for the same disabled.
When they called, he was happy to say, “Good day, you called at the cancer center.”
"It was very positive," said Abbott.
The disease was diagnosed four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning of Abbott, they offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and they would probably prolong his life for only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give it up.
Lawson, however, "has been able to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the chest surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage that I didn't have to wait until they sent me to him, but I just called and they saw me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get an application and they'd have to approve his compensation.
For patients with mesothelioma, the question of money is key.
But when different treatments finally fail inevitably, many patients face other financial concerns - about the future of the family they leave here.
And that's why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan with Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898 asbestos has been known to be harmful to health," says Morgan.
In the 1960 ’ s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And this is where we meet the troublemaker.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled, but according to Morgan, it wasn't a "full-scale settlement", because Lawson couldn't definitely prove that the mesotheli was the result of the asbestos exposure in Guy's Hospital.
However, after examining the case, the spokesperson Guy's Hospital confirmed that "the incriminate subterranean part was removed in the 1990s."
That was for Andrew Lawson too late.
How to remove asbestos
Bringing death asbestos exposure to one company or place of work - usually decades after this happened - proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
Many former jobs have changed owners or destroyed them.
The evidence's lost.
And those who are now accused of defending themselves have time on their side, and their plaintiffs certainly don't.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation was adopted this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek redress, even if it is not possible to investigate their former employer.
The law created a 350 million financial reserve, which is built by the insurance company and which is designed by people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but do not have anyone to sue.
In such a case, 80 % of the amount that the court would normally assign to them will be compensated - approximately 120 000 pounds.
Every year 300 successful requests are expected.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, thinks 350 million pounds is "good work".
"It is an agreement signed by insurance companies," he says and points out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if they did not waste time and people with mesothelioma would be able to feed ex-employers and normally complain about them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had gaps."
But Penning and Morgan admit that the seven deaths each year required a quick procedure.
"People suffer too much and need help immediately," Penning said last December during the second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdonski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, he recommended the Lang-Lazdun operation, which he considered to have a positive effect unlike Tom Treasure.
After surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were followed - a three-fold treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can benefit from survival levels of up to 40% of patients.
Abbott's strengthened it.
"This is, of course, not the most important thing," said Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition may worsen very quickly.
Graham Abbott joined the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last six cycles of chemotherapy.
Control visits showed no signs of disease.
I went to another check in March [2014].
In my chest, I had a few scattered velvet [roofs].
My 50s were just getting closer.
It's not a life threat.
Take it.
Abbott re-entered six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no signs of cancer in his body.
But it's a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial security when I die, or about showing the woman how the wake on the boiler works.
When you get the bad news, you start being negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition means I'll never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and savage.
She told her friends, and suddenly we started calling a lot of people.
Ellie was more persistent.
She didn't say much.
All patients with cancer have to face such interviews.
In patients with mesothelioma, such conversations are not left to chance or merely a sign of survival.
The disease brings with it (and finally brings Stephen Jay Gould) unhappiness.
As Andrew Morgan says, "life is not a threat to mesothelis."

Prohibition of imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for damage to health caused by asbestos exposure in Britain.
World production of asbestos is rising to more than 4,213,000 tonnes annually.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Institute for Health and Safety requires all asbestos suppliers to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos shall be prohibited in Britain by law.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose the leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
In spite of the multiple discussions on democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections.
This step is likely to lead to a long-awaited protest in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began to organize and plan only a few hours after this announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress basically allows Communist leaders to rule out any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't surprise us, but it upset us," said lawyer Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it is clear that we have something to do with the authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Fe said that allowing a public nomination in Hong Kong elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned to Hong Kong's administration, Beijing has promised that it will be able to elect the executive power in 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented Sunday decisions as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong allows direct voting, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leaders hold firmly to the process of appointing a committee closely controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clauses, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded one of the largest and most followed protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Most of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests are marked by the movement of the occupation of the Centre with love and peace, which the organizers have threatened to close the financial quarter unless Beijing grants them general voting rights.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the movement of the occupation gathered in the rain before the Hong Kong government.
In the demonstration, the organizers announced that their movement is entering the new phase of civil disobedience and that wave protests are starting in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, they obviously wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In its online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Centre only as a last step in the event of all possibilities of dialogue being exhausted and there will be no other choice.
We have to announce with the policing that today all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the siege of the Centre is inevitable.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement all day and have strengthened the protection of the government's seats on Sunday and have deployed police and barricades.
According to many Hong Kong residents, the problem is that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The accession of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of products and services.
They are also concerned that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are exacerbated by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people are criticizing the Central Occupancy movement and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - the rescue ship of Hong Kong.
"The protest he is talking about could cause much greater economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long," says politician Regina Ip, who criticises the movement for a long time.
We don't want Hong Kong getting out of control.
Such perception could damage investment.
The Chinese state media has also reported in recent days that democratic activists in Hong Kong describe as subversive Western-led agents.
In the summer, activists organised an informal referendum on voting rights, with 780,000 participants -- more than five voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
The pre-election agist?
The League in Jihlava bears its name according to political movement
A small mine is played by approximately 1,600 amateur athletes in the city of Highness.
And their highest competition is now known as the Joint League for the League of Jihlava.
The name was given according to one movement that goes into the October municipal elections.
A tenth of his candidate is also the chief of the small digger in Jihlava Jan Mráka.
"There was a great crowd where there was no problem with that," said the Dark.
The situation around the first league of small miners has already been handled by lawmakers in the Yugoslavian council and recommended that the system of distribution of grants be amended.
A small miner won about a million crowns on the city's website last year.
And this year it's about hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not a small mined procedure contrary to the law or to the directives of the Magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for granting grants and grants," spokesperson Radek Tulis said.
Deprive the city of subsidies and at the same time express as a small mined support in the elections of one political party, it will probably not go away.
A similar requirement from politicians has not yet come to high school "big" football.
That ČSSD would have a regional changeover, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
What about class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for you.
On the contrary, I would like the sponsors of a number of companies to address us," said the president of the national football team Miroslav Vrzáček.
Head of small football on the other side and move to the name of the league
According to players, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own area with six playgrounds, tents and social facilities.
"For example, the playground on the steps is not ours, we are there for rent," said Ondrej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava Club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech mill.
But there will be, for example, in my opinion, a pointless area for skaters, which is about fifty in Jihlava," the Darker said.
Primátor Jihlav Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small mine uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošsky and on the steps that are in the city's property.
We want to build a playground that has maximum use.
We are going to modernise or build sports areas at schools that will be available in the afternoon.
I think that huge progress has been made in recent years for a small mine," he added.
Another political party in the names of the leagues is not appearing according to Jan Dark.
We have limits.
If someone from one sector enters our partnership, then we don't go there anymore," he explained.
"Political movements in the name of the League, I consider this to be at least an unfortunate step," said a member of the Advisory Commission for Sport Karel Voldán.
"Let the electors decide, however, whether Mr. Márak is using the small mining company of Jihlava and subsidies to the city for political purposes, or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates university life - the first can fly by press
We are pleased that we can answer the question by launching the first luxury travel services for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression when arriving at the university, the company also offers the possibility of transporting including a private three-wheeler or a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service also has its security page.
Service is the ideal option for students who otherwise would have to train their things across the entire state in a dangerous car.
We are pleased that with our very important hairdresser (very important element) options this year, we will ensure students will arrive at the university with minimum nervousness and maximum luxury.
The spokesperson said that since the services had just dropped off, they had no reservations yet, but he added: “Students will start making reservations over the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that although students pay annual school fees of 9,000 pounds, they expect the service to take their place on the market.
Compared to ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today's students are different in terms of expectations and desires - it's more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as inconsistent.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is incompatible.
Many of the students who are attending this month's university must be able to cope with the financial crisis before thousands of pounds are released for something as simple as arriving on the track, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot take a step towards the rising cost of basic needs.
Feminists face racism and police behaviour after the Ferguson events
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson killed an unarmed young man in Missouri.
And those who wait for the funeral with their hands up shall say: Raise not your hands up.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson in Missouri for the shooting of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz recorded a move in the online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer sex before race.
With increasing tensions in the Middle West, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noted that the response of whites is 100 % focused on race.
Compared to the reactions of blacks shortly after the shooting on 9 August, personal articles with headlines such as "thinking of whites over Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about women's oppression" appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this is an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in feminist movement who would talk about race and discipline at such a level," she said.
People felt that what happened had to be said.
For the crisis we are facing, it is characteristic because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially protected that they have to pay attention to it.
According to English professors at the State University of Ohio, Korithy Mitchell, Ferguson presented a problem that African Americans have to face every day and that in the cultural sphere are not perceived as "women's issues".
"I can publish funny stories on Facebook from my partner's life and get 150 people from around the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about coloring in my own country is trapped, it's quiet.
"How is it possible for a woman to talk publicly about relations, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black people like Mitchell, who have dealt with the question of race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no question of race and sex dichotomy.
According to her, blacks could not add luxury to the problems of sharing these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although the whites today have a question of race and sex in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors have done the wrong.
Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black people were lynched and the reason was almost all cases of white violence," Hattery said.
For the sake of lynching, you needed the cooperation of whites.
According to Hattery, the gap between whites and blacks came when voters like Susan B. Anthony's researched at the end of the 19th century and realized that electoral rights can only have one group of people - women or blacks.
"The decisions to place cards on women's voting rights and on the right for blacks to focus later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we'll get an important preview of why colored women don't believe in whites.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black people to protect their husbands and children.
Even after the women gained electoral rights in 1920, it took ten years to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Women to prevent lynching.
The group was born 40 years after the blacks first said they were helping.
According to Mitchell, the reaction of white feminists to the questions that took place in Ferguson - the question of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "follow" the issues that black people faced for generations.
"Would it not be great if activists in these spaces [traditional feminism] had the right to raise a child as seriously as they had the right to an anti-conception?" Mitchell said.
The second wave of feminists who have made their career a struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now finding out what that means.
Significant feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown's attack on Facebook, where they published Rebecca Carroll's column from the Guardian, which demanded that the white Americans protest more wisely against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons to understand dangers in society - and opinions on race, which differ significantly in public opinion - will try to change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands up to cross-sectional feminism, which includes questions of race and sex, her comments on the question of race in America are made up of some people.
An expert at the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book "Who stole feminism?", said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young color men, are "a lot more vulnerable than their sisters", but the comments by the Steinem side of Ferguson face the criticisms that had already arisen.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother's Keeper program, which had help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it caused many feminists, including Gloria Steinem's angry reaction.
The police's relationship with the Black Community is not the only problem that comes to the fore in the interest of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police held almost 63 000 young people in the southwest of the country without escort this year, the issue of immigration law reform was raised again - this time as a female issue.
Andrea Mercadová, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women to reform immigration laws, said that to be able to raise the issue as necessary for women, the only thing she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"He speaks for himself," says Mercado.
Given that most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them feel vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have an ad in women's organisations," she said.
House of pigs in Ipswichi for sale
The real office removed the image of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, it was resting on it in a pig's living room.
A single-room house, which is for sale for 120,000 pounds, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photographs included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the pig’s couch.
The real office of Connells said the pig on the photo is a pet of the owners.
"The picture was wrong there, and that's why it's already been removed," the speaker's office said.
In information about the real estate, the real office of Connells described the former prayer as "one single single single room house."
Although the photo office has already removed from its website, promotional materials still appear.
The sale of the house caused interest on social networks where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey has the city on the southwest of fresh millionaire
The Harvey lottery player gets a million.
He's been looking for a new millionaire in the South East of Perth, one lucky guy from Saturday's lottery draw home will take $1.1 million.
Traffic in Harvey has been in happiness for over five years, last November 2009 was a win of one million dollars.
But the lucky winner just has to log in.
The owner of the store Steve Forward said he's talking about winning the whole town in southwest Perth.
It's the main theme and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was for touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia won one win last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five million August and only a few weeks ago in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning twins spent 20 years and said that winning will allow them to process the world and buy a new home.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, totaling $85 million.
The trains of Deutsche Bahn won't leave tonight.
Engineers want higher wages
The GDL in the press release marked a protest for a warning post for which he was approved to choose time outside the transport point.
At the chosen time, the GDL takes into account many people who return from the weekend to the train until the first working day.
At the same time, we also think about people coming for work during the day," the board said on Monday morning in the press statement to declare the position.
"Our first post should affect, in particular, freight transport, less passengers," added the GDL.
DB has not yet published the official response to the statement.
It is not even clear how the protest action will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The committees require an increase of 5 per cent in the number of drivers and a reduction in the working hours of two hours per week.
Currently, the average wage of engineers is moving between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) annually, depending on the years worked out.
Engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DBs refuse to access the increase in wages when the working time is reduced.
They stress, however, that the wage assessment of drivers must develop as well as other railway personnel with whom DB is not included in the reduction of the working week.
She threatened that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why Barum's rally is over.
What exactly happened?
It's about the wrong material.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think anything like that could happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be temporarily fixed and continued at a slower pace to serve where the mechanics would exchange it?
If we were going straight there, yeah.
But there were two more of us waiting and it didn't work.
There's a high temperature in it and the risk that the car would start to burn would be big.
I can't afford that.
In full-time, you've had five speed tests.
What do you think of them?
Very good.
I felt like a kid.
We were fast, but I didn't go through the wine.
Everything was caused by the car that we've had more than half a year to be at some level.
The race showed us that we did it.
You broke him up so you could really think of winning.
I made myself and my car so we really had to win.
Work didn't come in.
On the other hand, he didn't get the results that we could think of.
But it's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one who got out of the first battle.
He's got his foreign favorites Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Did it surprise you that so many favorites have gone away?
Yes.
Mostly for the spectators it was a pity because the race ended early.
Jaromír Tarabus has been on the scene for a long time, and you're going to drive.
But he added that he flew out of the alley and picked up almost two minutes' missing.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a pity he could have repeated his winnings.
He's been in the first two hours.
But Mira also confirmed that we found the car well.
He's going too fast.
Just a year ago you announced the end of your career, but you appeared at the start of Barum rally.
Could it make you feel good to drive again as a regular participant in rallying?
I'm sure not at this point.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race and I didn't get it anyway.
I decided I'd take her again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I'll probably go.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people came to the door just because of you.
Did that please you?
To some extent, we've just started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's up with you guys?
The team's going on.
Next week we'll go to Vyskov, where Robert Adolf will run.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
Besides, he wants us to borrow Honz Sykora's fabbies for this race.
With Mira, we have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
That's what we're gonna have to do next year.
Can you tell me something?
No, nothing's decided.
When Corsican rally was part of the world's championship, the fifth place you reached your maximum in the series.
Doesn't it bother you to try that trail again?
Don't worry.
An oral agreement with an employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not let yourself be exposed to a doctor's confirmation of the work disabilities that serve as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform your work for health reasons.
Besides, you didn't immediately inform the employer.
As a result, it was agreed that these days would be recorded as holidays, but the agreement only went orally.
Although the labour law does not impose an obligation to have a written confirmation of the employer’s consent with the drawing of a permit, this procedure has been proved in practice.
If there's only an oral agreement, you don't have a confirmation agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the drawing may be granted, as in your case, and the absence in the work may be considered as a long-term unexplained absence, so the reason for the immediate termination of the working relationship under § 53 of the Act of Employment.
In the case of a judicial dispute over an agreement with your employer, there is no evidence of this.
The working relationship with you has not been cancelled in accordance with § 53, you have only given the days in the spreadsheet as an unexplained absence.
Undeclared absence in the budget sheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the inability to obtain substantial unemployment insurance), but this makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and let yourself confirm in writing that the damage has actually occurred, as a result of which you have been unable to work (not known as "insomnia", it is just a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the presentation of a written medical certificate on disability, the rapid notification of the employer or the request for written consent to draw up the permit.
You're warning yourself of any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his way back
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a bit behind half the Atlanta Motor Speedway racetrack.
Stewart suddenly hit the ball after his right front tire broke in 172nd round, and the race for him ended.
Stewart took the corrupt car to the garage, didn't speak to reporters and left.
The chief of his team, Chad Johnston, said the car number 14 team was disappointed, but will now focus on a race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have a better performance and a better conclusion," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and we'll hope we get more.
Stewart went to play for the first time in a Sunday evening race after a bike with Kyle Bush, which he requested to repair his car.
"We put hope in a good marriage in the competition today," Johnston said and added, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at the New York race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to get the place on the table.
He returned to the race during the investigation of a tragic accident in which 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took Stewart in the race, died.
The authorities said the investigation of the cause of the accident would take at least two weeks.
So far, it has not been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-ply champion got a hot boost before the race.
Stewart started at 12th place, worked at 10th at the start of the race, and then even at 4th.
Then, at the beginning of 122nd car, Busch's car number.
18 got out of control, got out of the second turn, and hit Stewart, and sent both cars to the fence.
Stewart went on, but he got down to 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new taxi manager, earning 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new taxi operator.
At 103 parking stops, he gets about 12.3 million crowns a year.
Recently, for the same seats for taxi drivers, she selected 150 thousand crowns annually.
He informed the councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
The city used to be used for the choice of administrators.
The winner then won a rent of 1,000 kroner per year.
But the rules have changed.
At present, he decides on the amount of the tender.
"The year since the opening of the original leases and the opening of the selection procedure has proved that the new rental system is far more beneficial and more just for Prague," the council said.
The most expensive spot is in Perstyna
The highest price has been offered by interested parties for accommodation in the street of Na Perštín.
He'll pay 2.1 million kroner a year.
About 1.5 million crowns were paid by new administrators for seats in front of the General House or at the Vaclav Square.
The new rules on rentals were adopted by the tax authorities in the fall of 2012 and in the summer of last year the original leases were pronounced.
The selection procedure took place in four waves and the new manager found 29 positions.
We had to clean up the cold this year.
We've always let her go, which is what caused the second fisherman around the cabin.
Then we poured Savo.
Incredible breath!
Our cold in the store has always shot enough beautiful water.
And it wasn't really made by a witch, it was done by her grandfather with self-help.
It's been a long time.
She was just on three laps and she was totally sloppy, like everything else in the chat room, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course we drained the water.
When she got there for a number of months, she deserved it.
But even then we thought the water wasn't working.
We were wondering if something was wrong.
In the place where the pump was passing, it was possible at a bit of sadness, the board was not quite there, so the opening was sealed with a piece of silence.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise there was nothing to see in the water, and that's what we enlightened her to the bottom.
So we let her go again and we cleaned her up.
Of course, we've improved the improvised tightness around the pump pipe.
We've seen strange things in the cellar.
There was an earthenware package with some bones.
That's what it looked like.
And a little bit more.
Now it looked like an oscillated mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where streams, grandfather's inventions, there were remains of fish!
And it's hard to go!
Our store is also disgusting.
Someone would have said that Grandpa just had a little bit of a chat.
And it wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and floors are just dusty sand, only the ceiling is subdued.
They're taking the ships there mainly.
And the car.
And a beach bed.
The door with wide gaps was mostly open as someone walked there in one piece.
At the roof of several of the already mentioned pipelines.
Without the network, so they usually fly birds and build nests on the trams.
It's unnecessary to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to fight, and that's it.
Now, however, no air has helped.
The whole store blew up.
So we cleaned the whole store.
Especially the fish on the tram was alive!
We also threw out things that were around: pranks, heraclitic boards, and so on.
Our cabin at the end of the day was greeted by a passing disinfectant.
We've been thinking about who could get us those nasty leftovers?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here all over.
It would be hard for us to celebrate.
Grandpa attacked a neighbor who's not completely okay.
If he didn't bring the Frant to our attention, did he?
He's been around for almost a year, stupid ideas, he's got it.
We decided to watch the store and regularly check the cold.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using water again, so far only on washing and washing before the tests are finished, but it was good.
Pulling water from the forest barn is nothing I'd like to do for a long time.
We once heard a terrible horrible bite of our pheasant.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw in the grass next to the porch a long, strong black Hadik.
The knife jumped over her and peeped like a fool.
My mom made it up because she thought that Réza was digging a garbage dump out of the washroom.
All of a sudden, the snakes were part of the club and part of the line.
There's been a drought on the balcony.
She got hysterical arrest.
We ran down.
An old man, long over a meter and thick as a bull, was about to crush a huge rag, and Réza was defending it.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save her life or if she wanted to eat it alone, but it was pointless.
When the cook saw the power of our whole family, she probably said that we could eat it when we were so hungry, and she made an elegant spread into the store.
We were flying for her.
It's a very bright jump for the cold.
Just by the way, we've noticed another smelling package on her desk.
According to the smell of fish.
She wasn't there before!
Our new security around the pump was a little gray.
And that's what we've closed down the store over the day.
That he would...
We went out and we'd all come down to one stream.
We haven't waited long.
It's embarrassing for the cold.
First there was a flat head with yellow moons on its neck.
Then the whole truck broke out in the cold.
She swam around the pump and started getting in.
The fired employee took revenge, bought a notebook at the company and sold it.
A mature employee bought it on a computer company after he was released and then sold it.
The money they got came before the police were arrested to lose.
During a short period of time, a man bought in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"After the transfer, the notebooks drove him to Olomouce, where he was selling after the bazaars," said top commissioner of the Shamper police Rostislav Brückner.
The reason for the fraud was the employer's debt for release and also for the gain of money.
"When he questioned us, he claimed that he used the money to pay off the loans," Brahnner said.
The police also found out that a cheater is a pathological player who has repeatedly been treated on psychiatric grounds.
Money could also end up in winning devices or in video lottery terminals.
"The fact is we haven't found any money with him," said the Commissioner.
The traitor, who was already punished for theft, now threatens to stay in prison for one year to five years.
So far, the police haven't known if they're threatening to punish even the bazaars who bought and sold the notebooks.
"It is true that they have taken over completely new goods, which is minimally suspicious," said the Commissioner.
However, none of the bazaar's owners have been charged so far.
Come on, just a little bit more, you can handle it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague.
This year, our editors have made several changes.
The biggest was the change in the route, which led to the goal of flooding, instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race together with the rest of Runo.cz team, but I was going to live it a little bit on the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to heal our readers personally at a stand where we took pictures and videos together.
To achieve perfection, I took the role of a personal guide to my eyes on the other side.
Together with a friend of Katya, we arranged for the end of the corridor between 60 and 70 minutes just before the start.
We were greeted by friends who were passing by us into the faster-run sector.
There wasn't much time left.
A few hot jumps, turn on sports tests, recalculation and start!
The screams of jasote, but instead of a quick start, followed the boiling to the start line.
After five minutes, we arrive at the gate, turn off the measurement, and break down at ten o'clock.
We are surrounded by yellow hares of runners who, like Kata, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, slowly falling sun on the sky gives a view of the Vyšehrad almost as much as a kangaroo.
The pulsating mass pulling along the coast looks like the whole of Prague is running.
On the coast between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally beginning to show who has the strength.
A light hill at the Palack Square forces many runners to slow down or walk.
Just before going to the Theatre, I see the police escort and immediately behind him is Vítek Pavlista at an incredible pace to the goal.
I can hear the amazing invigorating respiration of other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to cry with me, but just before that, my legs are going to fall and our hands are going to fall down.
Over the street, the street gives you a chance to relax and relax.
There's a need for places in front of us that give me a breath.
The island on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in the beauty of the falling sun.
I don't breathe, and my legs are almost alone.
For the first time in my life, there's a moment of truth.
At the crossing of Kata's road, he scurries about the fence and takes a swim to the beach.
I see if she doesn't need help, and I'm going to give her a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
He wakes up and we continue with the Kozí street, it's one of the southernmost places of the track, but at this stage of the race, there's no more trouble, but there's a need to monitor the environment.
I still don't know that the concept of a southern place will get its true meaning later.
At the Prague gate, we are encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I'm trying to compete with everyone who offers a hand, and I'm also recommending it to Kata, because ten matches with fans are like half an energy plug.
It's actually working, we're speeding up again, and even though we've missed a lot, now we're starting to complain.
We're running through dozens of runners when I change someone who's particularly tired, I'm trying to encourage him a few words, "Come on, one more bit, you can do it!"
No one's ahead of us for the last cleaning lady, we're speeding up.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the point of pain, but it's really necessary to ease.
The sun has fallen slowly and the final day symbolically ends the race.
The last exit to the bridge, the turn and the only way to reach the target.
The tempo we're running at surprises me where that girl gets it?
"Come on, let's go under thirteen hours, let's make it!"
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a target.
An hour of thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
Coach set a limit of twenty hours.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
Just to get Kata's feet broken, I'm gonna help her get her back to where she's resting for a while.
It's about to see exhaustion, but also happiness from a good performance.
After a while, I'll take her out of the target room.
Euphoria doesn't make us think of the pressure in the passageway to the shadows.
Here it is seen that the Koz street was not the southernmost place.
That's why it's here for a flood that's under pressure of nearly ten thousand runners to break up.
If anyone doesn't like gifts, it's not a place for him.
I also lose my head for a while, and I wonder if those wonderful prospects and, contrary to last years, the most interesting route was worth what's going on in the target.
I know from my own experience that running a race is no fun.
If ten thousand people are added, the rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire Prague centre for all transport is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route showed runners many interesting places, which also brought a few really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere emitted in the Yellow Bathrooms was transferred between the race and the competition itself.
The organizers around the track and random spectators would scale it on every meter of track.
Unfortunately, in the course of the city's historic centre, it has to be counted with obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of the mass race in a place that is on one side of the wall and on the other of the river is not considered the best solution.
If I say the race's over with a running target, I'll evaluate it as very well-advanced.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but it all worked out well.
Write to us if you like the route and what you say about the situation in the target.
Prisoners in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison staff throughout Bulgaria participated in the international protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their requirement to restore the original working conditions that had recently changed.
The list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice Christo Ivanov also includes higher fees.
The overseers of the month symbolically protested against the new working time and demanded a return to the original twenty - four - hour shifts.
Although the Committees of Prison Oversight and the representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, they informed the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
"The negotiations are still ongoing," said BNR, Head of the General Directorate of Prison Service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
Members of the Federation of Professional Organisations of Employees will also be expected to join the protests of prison officials in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we don't see them
The physics usually doesn't write bestsellers, but Brian Green from the Columbia University in 1999 was hit by a hit in black.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way of getting through to a host of problems that are now dealing with a number of theoretical physics - trying to unite two great functioning but mutually incompatible revelations of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is that in the search for a united physical theory, there is no boring story.
The basic physical problem between two key theories (although at this point our universe is de facto divided into two different worlds with different laws) has been solved and solved with such an idea that it is worth re-reporting and time.
Greene also advised himself so much fresh and hard that he could not calculate how much interest he had not included in his book.
In addition, he corrected his "error" from most of the other two books: The Structure of the Universe and the Hidden Reality.
The author would probably not object to anything if his book was getting older faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years the elegant universe still provides almost everything that the informed time with the ambition of understanding the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is relatively likely that in the next few years, there will be something more alive in this area (should be because the accelerator LHC will finally go to "full gas") and so it is good to enter Green's non-violent doors of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound ridiculous, fantastic, strange or mystic.
Yet it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let's turn our vision from space to space as a whole to something lower, specifically to a long and thin garden garden garden to pour.
Imagine that you pull a hundred metres from one side of the canyon on the other and follow the whole scenario from a half mile away (as on the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily notice a long, horizontally-tight hazelnut, but if you just don't have the bristle, you will recognize the thickness of the hazelnut.
In view of your great distance from the Hadicle, you would think that the ant forced to live on the Hadicle has only one dimension in which it can pass: the left-right dimension along the Hadicle.
If someone asks you where the ant was at the moment, answer him only with one indication: the distance of an ant from the left (or right) end of the snake.
So all we want to say is that from a half-kilometre away, the long piece of the curtain looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, it's got a fat snake.
If we increase everything, we'll suddenly see a second dimension -- in the shape of a circle that's circulatory.
In this broadened view, it is obvious that an ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well-known left-right dimension along the length of the ant, but also in "the dimension in/against the direction of movement of the clock gloves", i.e. around the round edge of the ant.
You start to understand that in order to determine the position of the small ant you have to enter two numbers: how far is it from the end of the Hadicle and where it is on the round of the Hadicis.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the Hadicle is bidimensional (later experts will see that this chapter focuses purely on the disorder theory of strings.
Immediate aspects shall be discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the Hadik is bidimensional: one long length dimension is shown by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circle marked by a circular arrow, is short and porous.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size of the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the rounding of the curtain is short, "sweet" and the mountain is well known.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the Hadik with a much better resolution.
This example illustrates the important feature of spatial dimensions.
That they're divided into two groups.
They can be large, stretchy, and therefore directly visible, or rather small, sweaty, and much worse visible.
Of course, in that case, we were just not presuming to reveal the "sweet" dimension of the wave thickness of the Hadice.
It was enough to take a long look at it.
But if the Hadiks were thinner - like hair or capillary - we would only discover the porous dimension with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein his article, in which he conveyed with an amazing idea that space geometry could have more than three known dimensions for all of us.
Kaluza’s radical claim was based on the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein’s general relativity and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory can be vetcated into the only unified conceptual structure.
Immediately, the question arises as to how this Kaluz look goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer Kaluza quietly predicted between the lines, which he clearly expressed and clarified by Swedish mathematician Oscar Klein in 1926, stands and falls on the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and sweaty dimensions.
This means that, just like the dimensions in the direction of the length of the Hadik, our universe also has large, spacious and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we realize at every moment.
But analogously with the circular perimeter of the garden garden, the universe can also have additional dimensions, solidly swirled into the space so inconceivable that so far there have remained hidden even in front of our most perfect experimental devices.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluz's remarkable proposal, let's stay at the harbor for a while.
Imagine that we draw a black and relatively dense series of circles around the fence.
From a distance, it still looks like a thin uniform line.
With a far-sighted view now, the drawing will reveal the porous dimension of the rope, so we will see the motive of image 2.
We see clearly that the surface of the curtain is bidimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and round.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circle dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, together with four space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imaginations a little bit, note the illustration on page 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
The image increases the view of the geometry of space just as we increased the surface of the Hadik.
Each following level represents a huge increase in space geometry from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (see them at the fourth level of enlargement), if they are swirled into enough small space; thus we explain that we have not seen them before.
The square network represents the commonly known "great" dimension, while the circle is a new, small and porous dimension.
Just like the loops of thread in a densely wrapped blanket, even these circles exist in every place of normal sizes - only because of the opinion we have drawn them only to the averages in the square network.
The background of image 4 represents the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in regular dimensions such as the meters, as shown by the side of the small square in the square.
On each of the following images, we will focus on the small area of the previous image; we will increase it to become visible.
At first, there's nothing special about it, as we see on a few first-level increases.
However, if we move on to our path behind the microscopic characteristics of space geometry further - at the fourth level of the magnification in image 3 - we will see a new, shape of a circle of porous dimension, similar to that of the loops or in a densely woven piece of cover.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions as well as has had hadic circuit circumference at every point of its length.
In the interest of opinion, we have drawn the circle size only in some regularly located points.
Image 4 Kalusov and Klein's image of the microscopic structure of space geometry summarizes.
The similarity to the hat is obvious, although we also note important differences.
First of all, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we drew only two), where the Hadice has only one large size.
The more important difference is that we're talking about space geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, maybe our Hadik.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the extra-circularly porous dimension is extremely miniature, recognize it - as well as the circular round of thehadice - much more difficult than observing the apparent, large and extended dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it above the strength of our most modern enhancement tools.
Most importantly, however, the additional dimension is not just an oblique backbone within normal dimensions, as double-dimensional illustrations correctly indicate.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists in each point of three common extended dimensions.
It is the size of the remaining three dimensions independent as are the size of the tail-down, the left-right and the front-back independent (and the back) each other.
A fairly small ant could move in all four dimensions and to determine its position, we would need four data, except three other common positions in the circular dimension; if we count time, then five data, in each case more than we would normally expect.
Did you care?
Book The elegant universe of Brian Greenen you can buy here on books.idnes.cz.
The price for e-book is 149,- CZ.
To our surprise, therefore, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzov and Klein's idea that this does not exclude the existence of additional layers of lead if they are small enough.
The universe can have more peaceful dimensions than we can see with only an eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can identify the structures of a billionth of a metre.
We can hardly see the small swirling dimension.
In 1926, Klein combined the original Kaluz's idea with several thoughts from just parenting quantum mechanics.
Its calculations indicated that the additional circular dimension could have the size of about one Planck length, that is, the size far away from the different capacities of today’s devices.
Since then, physics has called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions of Kalus-Klein theory.
Wohnut Honza Homola advises how to practice electric guitar: 5th part
The whole substance "twelve" consists of a twelve-tactic harmonic form, which you can repeat voluntarily.
Whoever's tapping into the music theory will find its principle explained here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By educating a wallet and a wallet, whose facebook profile can be monitored here, he has been living as a graphic artist for 20 years.
He's a guitarist of the Wahnout band, from which unfortunately he can't leave.
The guitarist is after his father, just like his brother Matthew, the leader of the Wohnouts.
Start training on one line.
"The rhythmic model is just for you, you can figure out anything, then just apply it to a harmonious model of twelve," says Honza.
If you add another string, you can swap the figure again.
Just listen to and follow Honza, which can be thought out with twelve harmony on two lines and how well it's starting to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can already pop some songs with the melody.
When you finally add the fourth, attention to the change of the alloy, he alerts Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza's going back to the pentatonium and you're gonna try to put her together with twelve.
So practice it properly.
Best of all, you can read it in a conversation with Jan Homola at his first school lesson on electric guitar here.
Another target without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, the castle castle admits
Let's take the point, and we like it.
For the first time we had more chances, for the second house," said the attacker, who this time scored from the stake.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, were you just following her huge sand?
I didn't get it any more, even though on the second market, where domestic fans are, it'd probably be worse.
You fixed the penalty after half an hour, but you also scored the target from the penalty after four minutes.
What happened?
We fell asleep at first, we were passive, the horn came out of it, and then the penalty after it.
You woke up after her, and the first time you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree with the fact that we've been playing well after the incassed goal until the break.
In the cabin we said we wanted to keep the pace of the game after it, but we couldn't.
To tell the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it's probably also true that the housewives said something about their game, maybe they weren't very happy with it.
You were just the first to score in the field, while at home you might not even have got a target.
Why is it such a difference?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, but it depends on us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Plzen, that's another category.
Four matches you were waiting for, you weren't afraid that it might be similar after the last match?
Maybe not, but of course we're glad that since the last match, we don't have to talk about waiting for a goal.
Now we've added more without waiting, but there's still only three in six matches, which isn't much of a celebration yet.
Island - lava flows from a mile away.
A lion flying on the surface in the area of Holuhraun near the glacier of Vatnajökull, flows by underground tunnel from the kilometers away from the crater.
It is located below the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This reality now concerns the most...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still runs out of the cliff about the same amount of lava.
Unlike the original estimates, however, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
In contrast to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x larger.
However, scientists are afraid that the lava tunnel could open even in areas where it is under ice.
In addition to the same intensity as the current eruption, this would mean huge floods, both on the river Jökulsá at Fjöllum and on the other rivers.
Around the eruption is a strong smell of cheese, a cloud of steams and gases rises from the cracks.
It certainly does not deal with the eruption suitable for the tourist movement, as was the case in the case of the eruption at Fimmvärdhuhals in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are much more gas," says Volcanologist Armann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, and in the early hours it has been in the field of almost windy.
The feet after the sandstorm were dropped by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
The orange level (the second highest) for Barderbung and the yellow (third) for Asku is applicable for air operations.
The sky over Chebe belonged to brave Lady Peggy.
She went through the wings.
Flying day in Cheb.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 was introduced by Peggy Valentina, who came out of the cockpit during the flight to the upper wing of the double wing as well as between the wings.
There's nothing left but muscle power.
The summer day in Cheb was already falling this year, and the authors were able to prepare a few interesting pieces of air.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only "walking through the wings" in the German acrobat of Peggy Valentin, but also a legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft 18th.
The guy paid attention to his brilliant instincts.
Acrobat called Wingwalking has origin in the United States.
After World War I, many of the former war pilots were trying to launch.
But because of the large number of fatalities, it was prohibited.
But today he's getting back to the flight day program.
Peggy will come out of the cockpit on the top wing after the start.
There's a variety of exercises.
At the end of the show, it moves into space between the wings of the plane, where its show continues," said Luděk Matějæček from the Czech Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day.
The pilot of Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband, Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main funnel of the program, then the next performance of Mustang's complaint was the famous shaker on the cake.
The legendary plaintiff joined the Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in the curtain (so-called numbers).
Such a composition could be seen by flying fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then gave everyone the breath of the acrobatics with a plane from 1945.
He was still made for war, but he probably never took part in it.
He was included in military reserves.
Since 1963 he has been active in the civil sphere.
Even as a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradišti.
In the same place is also another pearl of Chebian flight day, a two-engine Beechcraft C45H consignor.
He didn't go to the airport to look at the machine.
His excruciating clay floor was burning far away.
He also won the Max Holst MH 1521M Broussard machine in the colors of French aviation.
The small aircraft jumped for the rejected Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation to the flight day from the German Hof.
The German neighbours in Cheb carried out with reconstructed aircraft as 18T or three-member formation of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
The parental care has replaced Lucie Borhy at least for tonight's work.
Stress or nervousness - a blonde moderator obviously doesn't know anything about it.
Modern TV news was good for her, as if she hadn't stopped for two months at all!
It's only two weeks after the blondes finished six weeks, where women experience the greatest stress after birth.
However, Lucie will not show again regularly in the main news report TV Nova.
Regular return is expected according to information from Blesk.cz up to a month.
In fact, only Linda's daughter now needs more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhy's back on the TV screen, and it was a blow to the black.
Shows for a year in Prague?
Hala would sell herself out. She's planning a divorce.
It would be worth it if something like this happened during the world's championship.
But it matters how the bond is built," said a display in Jihlava called the Golden Race, in which a fascinating Nagan team met again.
And the players who took part in the gold hat.
The players should like it, shouldn't they?
Sure.
It would be briefly good to make a farewell to the golden generation during the championship.
I think they're allowed to find one two days during the tournament when it's completely free and where such a race could be involved.
Let's say it to Gum (Jiřim Šlégrovi) or Bédj Šerban (rapporteur of the Jujulav match) who would take care of it...
The arena would be sold out.
But what if you're playing with New Jersey play-off?
So if I fly like this...
You don't want to play in the performance.
Or did the Thursday meeting somehow change your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and the performance is decisive.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially to the world's championship.
There should be players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision never changed.
How did you actually take advantage of the Nagangian search?
It was just a great meeting with the players.
A man has lived through stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was Ivan Hlink's respect.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that there's a generation that's really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimir Rosička and Petr Čechmánek at the center.
Do you still have your first representation match on your own?
You don't forget about things like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young men: me, Robert Holík, and Robert Reichel, we were in one three.
For all, it was the first representative start.
But if we were to dominate in some way, we wouldn't be able to say that.
In Jihlava, Dominik Hasek has been hunting for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hasan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with that criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jágra for the reasons why he decided to end up in representation).
He's been a great performer.
Then you used to practice with me once in the night and there was a hole.
And now he's caught famous.
First U.S. and then the Netherlands, footballers start qualifying
On Monday morning, prominent guests arrived at the NH Hotel.
People could see Peter Chech from Chelsea, the representative coach Paul Vrb...
And over there, this building in a black dress, it's Tomáš rossky!
The hostage of Arsenal and the captain of the representation arrived at the battle about half a dozen among the last.
We have a great fight against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said, when he appeared before the press in the representative assembly.
Czech representation programme
Monday 1 September: start of strike, first training
Tuesday, September 2nd: Training open for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramiada (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of strike
Russian and sex fans can support even before the mid-term fight against the United States (20:15).
The representation for them opened the Tuesday training, which begins at the Summer at 18:30.
And after him will follow autographs that Russian and Czech won't miss.
Otherwise, this mix of national teams will be calmer.
Which commends Coach Vrba, who was complaining about the number of social actions in the spring.
Finally, we will devote ourselves to what we want to dedicate ourselves to.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage if you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not yet been so long," said Vrba, who officially runs the national team since January.
The Czech football team will carry a Musketeer image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The representation has three matches behind it under the Vrb, all ready.
With Norway and Finland she resigned 2:2 and with Austria losing 1:2.
However, these results have not yet been significant.
That's it.
The challenge with the Netherlands is starting with qualifications for the European Championship 2016.
Of course, the Czech team would help if the General was able to fight the United States.
The first half was to get to know each other.
Now there are important results.
We have to think about being successful," Vrba said.
The only player who has a three-and-a-half-year appointment with health problems is the attacker David Lafat.
It's going to get warm.
If he couldn't get healed in the middle fight against the U.S., Coach Vrba would have called another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman in Britain describes how many years after her diagnosis, she thought she was going to die.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her childhood thinking that she was only a few years away.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the pancreas.
The charity CMT UK stated that bad diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because there is only a very little knowledge about the disease.
It is estimated that in the United Kingdom, CMT suffers from some 23,000 people, which may show symptoms in the field of motors such as muscle weakness, abnormal walking, and broken fingers.
In the event of insensitiveness or pain, this condition is untreated and progressive, which means that the symptoms are worsening over time.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's ataxia (FA) - a disease that has a very bad prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her 18th birthday, she would be sitting on a wheelchair and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same.
I fell down every day and it took me a long time.
I could never ride with the other kids on my wheelchairs or skateboards and at school I was embarrassed about how I walked and ran."
When Rodgers was 13 and she was after several operations that were supposed to relieve her Achilles' feet and equal her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room, and looked into her documentation where she found out that she was suffering from the FA.
“I felt guilty because I was following, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home, I searched for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” he says.
When they answered, I was in shock, I panicked.
I thought before I was eighteen, I'd end up in a car, and before I was fifty, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd lose all my abilities.
I was totally alone and was planning a funeral."
When she was 17 years old, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she expected and asked her surgeon.
He just stood up and hugged her and said: “Dear dear, I don’t think you have the disease, otherwise you’d be in the car.
I think it'll be a much less dangerous life."
After completing several genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT is, I thought I was happy," she said.
The charity CMT UK launched a month of information about CMT to warn of this disease.
Entrepreneurship in the area of Washington: tax on economic turnover
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local taxes on companies in the country with a rapid recovery of the economy increased slightly last year and companies in Washington were no exception.
For the fiscal year 2013, entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia together took $27.6 billion into state and local treasures, which is 3,8 % higher than $26.6 billion in 2012.
The tax burden - state and local - rose by 4.3% last year to 671 billion dollars compared to 3.9% last year and was the third growth year after 2009 and 2010, when the tax fell.
According to a study conducted by the professional company Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state tax increased faster by 4.3% than local revenues by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56%, is from the income tax and 36% of Maryland's income is from the company.
Virginia, with 28 %, accounts for a relatively small amount of tax revenue from the company.
The researchers claim that the majority of the tax revenue growth is due to an increase in the value of real estate to companies belonging to them, which has increased by 3,7 % after three years of real estate tax.
Although most profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vrigini paid more than ten billion dollars last year on state and local property taxes, which represents an annual growth of 4.2% compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in the value of the property is so low as to exclude state and local tax revenue in Maryland, where property tax represents an incomplete five company tax.
For firms in Virginia and D.C., the property tax represents almost half of the state and local tax.
“In Maryland there is a lot of real estate owned by companies, especially the tax base around D.C., a government or non-profit organization that does not pay taxes,” explained Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on, for example, income tax to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
The recent increase in corporate tax revenue cannot be attributed to a healing market with real estate.
According to the data, the revenue from the company appears to be also increasing.
Companies in this region have published a tax from commercial companies of 2.3 billion dollars, which have risen from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has chosen one billion dollars for revenue from commercial companies, most in the region.
Although they are dressed in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs does not grow in these three places as quickly as possible.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average level of 4,3 %, while Maryland growth was significantly higher, 4,9 %.
Only in Virginia was an increase of 4,1 % on average.
Virginia has a minimum income tax of 6 % of all three districts (all of which have the same tax).
The rate of taxation of commercial companies in Maryland is 8,25 %, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, to 9,975 %.
A similar study carried out this year by the American Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has a lower government and local tax and a more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study was not evaluated.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed a law that reduces corporate tax from 6,9 % to 6 %, as well as Virginia, and the next year the tax will be reduced to 5 %.
If the revenue targets are to continue to be met in the coming year, the statutory rate of income tax could be reduced to 3 % in 2017.
According to a recent study with small businesses in Washington, it is better to pay higher government and local taxes.
Life tax levied by small businesses as a personal income tax - the structure of compensation for cost increases by price increases, according to which most companies are organised - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia grew by 20% last year to 2.4 billion dollars, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers argue that the trend and overall increase in living taxes are likely to continue next year, overall tax revenues from public and local government sales will increase by 6.2 % over the same period in the first three quarters of 2014.
Washington may, however, remain behind others because the reduction of public expenditure is choosing its tax on the labour market.
What's left of you: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorusko and Lafat's knives
Will a new state emerge in Ukraine?
Putin called for a hearing on Novorusk
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the southeast of Ukraine, where government units have been meeting with pro-russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that under the current anti-Russia sanctions regime they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine, according to it, opposes democratic values.
The end of the conflict according to him depends on Kyev, so he can't say when the Ukrainian crisis ends.
Any more sanctions for Russia?
Czech Republic failed to agree with the part
The European Commission, together with diplomats, will propose another form of anti-Russia sanctions for the week, decided tonight at the EU Summit.
The president of the Member States' meetings, Herman Van Rompuy, told reporters.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for the sanctions motion are to be prepared already on Monday.
Tusk will be the new Union president.
Van Rompuye will be replaced in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected at the summit of the European Union to the European Council, the so-called President of the Union, who is holding the summit meetings of the Member States.
From December to two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuye will be replaced.
In front of the European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton's Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed Federica Mogherini.
Italy, which will thus become the Vice-President of the future European Commission, still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, it's not just about it.
Helping an incurable and long-term patient who has left his life?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not permit euthanasia, that is not legally possible.
However, the statements made by the doctors to the LN indicate that they hear such requests.

He knew the CIA handwriting, they needed a war, writes Huml about the shooting of MH17
The consignor for the ČSSD Stanislav Huml is clear in who shot Malaysian aircraft over Ukraine.
According to him, it is obvious that "the strong sanctions that were declared in the light of the shooting of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army".
According to the law firm, it's also the CIA's handwriting.
Unfulfillable promises.
The elections are near and the parties offer again impossible
End of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and chain over Prague.
This is repeated before every election: the parties promise impossible.
It is also now that politics is being pursued by the upcoming municipal elections, which are being pursued by those who prefer them more.
Lidovky.cz server has chosen incomplete promises from the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechs landed at Dunkerque.
There's been a steady siege.
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czech-Slovenian Lonely Brigade moved to France.
Her commander Alois Liška has consistently requested the addition of technical equipment and forwarding to the front.
The British party finally recovered, and this earthly unit was organized as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German armies.
SOUHRN: Plzeň leads the league before the Prague "S", Liberec declared Baník
Victoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, which leads to a point in front of both Prague's "S".
Changes in the table led to the defeat of Slavia 1:2 in Mladé Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta was remembered in the domestic league, with two Lafat attacks being defeated by Jablonec.
The record victory in the year was signed by Liberec, who shot Baník Ostrava 6:0.

Fortunately, there are certified types of how to cope with the changed situation: not to rush and enjoy quality sleep.
Joan Rivers family: "We hold our fingers"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to New York City's hospital, but her daughter said today she's not losing hope that an 80-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," said Melissa Rivers in today's statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the rescue service, according to which she came to the heart of the Yorkville Endoscope in Upper East Side, as the source said.
Doctors deliberately maintain it under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of its condition that remains “serious”.
The reactions didn't let themselves wait long, and it was also inconceivable online support from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Reality is a cross-sectional title
That the media is transforming reality with their headlines, there's no news.
I know the headlines "sales" of the newspaper, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that's the fact that I've been having a lot of trouble lately, more pronounced than ever.
This is particularly true of the articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
It's quite common to have the headlines "Israel Attacked on Gaza."
You can only read in the text that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the fire rockets from the Gaza Strip, often in the time of the declared excuse.
It will then appear the title "Both sides have broken suit."
Does the journalistic council realize that this process is directly involved in anti-Semitic positions that are growing across Europe (and not just there)?
It hasn't been 60 years since the end of World War II.
So far, people who have survived the show live.
When I saw a video from the German Republic, where the Daw used the words "Jewish Pig" and similar mistrust, it caught me.
Is this what the world wants to finish what Hitler failed?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews they were destined to eliminate the Slavic?
Ladies and gentlemen, please give more attention to your work.
You are often referred to as "watchdogs of democracy."
So defend her.
As long as he's here.
Also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbours decided that the Czech nation was going to eliminate and expel the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Maybe you should also realize one more fact.
Nearly 20% of Israeli citizens live in the territory of the State of Israel.
And they're good there.
If you ask them why they don't go between their own, maybe into Gaza, they'll answer you why would they do that?
In Israel, they have work, social security and health care (I have seen in my own eyes, how in the top private hospital Hadassa, which is funded from the sponsorship gifts of Jews from all over the world, usually also Arab people are also being treated there).
Hamas will attack his Arab brothers with his arrows.
The only real help to Gaza is to rescue Hamas and disarm him.
And not judge Israel, not directly in the headlines.
Inform Hamas about his practices, his abuse of people as human shields.
Please inform Hamas that he intends to eliminate the state of Israel at any cost.
Even for the death of innocent Arab children.
Please report that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organisations.
Please note that in nine years' time, the Gaza Strip could have been a thriving area thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity, which the Gaza Strip does not pay for, and is even upset that the supply of electricity is interrupted at this time.
If Hamas did not invest money in the construction of underground tunnels so that they could be penetrated by suicide attackers in the territory of Israel, but the building of homes, hospitals and schools would be much better for his Arab brothers from Gaza.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed claims Monday morning information: Internet retailer - video producer and hundreds of other things - buys for $1.4 billion (US$970 million) video streaming service Twitch.
The announcement was not surprising because no one expected someone to buy Twitch, but because it was expected that the buyer would be YouTube.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitche Google for one billion sure looked like a natural connection.
Twitch, which just three years ago founded Justin.tv, had been blinded to become a commonly used video streaming service - live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online broadcasts from the game - the words Business Insider "YouTube for live broadcasts".
Interface Twitche.
On YouTube are already popular videos "Let's play", a type where wise people (mostly older) play mystery science theater processing games.
The fact is that YouTube’s description of Twitche comes at a crossroads many times, so the news that YouTube is buyingTwitch, which has not really shaken anyone, was an example of how an established company will pay off possible competition.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal didn't come out, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have is the statement by CEO Twitche Emmet Sheara: “We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our society, it has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us fulfill it faster.”
Another mystery is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who claim that sports are doing better than they are, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about, games instead of real play just to watch.
One thing is to watch a friend over his shoulder at three in the morning, as Resident Evil plays, and another thing is to watch someone else get twenty shots in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today's, most popular games are from the player's perspective, so looking at their record without you being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for how to sort out the uglav.
I admit that games like speed run, in which Rogers Banners our electronic times finish the game in record time is fun.
But if someone isn't a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitch probably won't be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is the fourth on top of Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon use that?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch interferes with Amazon Instant Video as elegant as it might have been on YouTube.
But Twitch has something she'd like to attract every company: the hordes of young men who the advertisers want.
As Twitche Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "believes in the future of the game" and the media don't seem to be acting, or like -- the -- the -- the -- the viewers.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of American atheistic blogger Aaron Ra.
This time on the theme "Holy Letters Are God's Word."
Added original video.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of many things that are contrary to their religion, they often ask us, Whom will you believe?
To the supposed word of God, or to the word of man?
It's like human research is completely worthless compared to the authority they think it has.
Only when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they refer to myths about the people recorded.
If there is really an intelligent designer for some purpose, then he is the one who created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and he must be the one who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and he must be the one who added another series of evidence that show only the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people will tell stories, falsify stories.
And it was people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposed sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as people who are written, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictation of angels, but those texts were not written to anyone other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and no longer gods.
If there really was one real God, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, supergalactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the whole cosmos.
If the creature had ever written such a book, there would have been only one such book, the only holy letter.
She would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could not measure with such work.
And people would not have to believe it blindly because it would be consistent, subject to verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human boundaries.
It would take time for every reader to inspire the unity of the common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't have expected anything less.
It's just that what we see instead is exactly the opposite.
Instead of the only religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without any common origin, and all are constantly disunited with more and more separate denominations, searching for conflicting truth and in every way calling for God’s guidance, regardless of the continuing disunity and division in every way.
Jewish Torah, Christian gospel, Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'lláhov Kitab-i-Akdás, Zarathustrova Avesti, Sikh Adi-Granth, Mahabharátsk Bhagavad-Gita, Book Mormonov, or Urantia book are all regarded as "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of one true God" and the respective believers say that these others are on their way.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is to some extent in luck.
None of the above books have any other advantages.
None of them have any evidence of resistance and none of them can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the Western Michigan University.
I do not say that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologise (obhajobs), because they contain inequalities, absurdities and primitive ideas that have ever been considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be claimed that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote evil monsters instead of immorality and many of them claim to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - with the fact that everyone can also contain the prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
The early theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretation, perception, and views of their primitive and often bound political motivated authors, which explain many of the contradictions and inequalities in these books, especially those found in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, rather a mutual comment.
We need to point out again that there are two different authors here whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author and definitely isn't telling an obvious witness!
Some experts now differentiate four different sources only for Pentateuch, i.e. five books of Moses and Moses do not assign authority to any of them, because almost certainly there was no such thing as the Bible describes.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several closely related oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents have been re-filtered at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic faiths, yet they are in many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed perceptions and ebony and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups as Luciferians were scattered and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these regulations relates to King Ugarita, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to the young Mossian religion, the authors of the New Law decided to laugh and Ba'al Zebula, "Lord on the Mount" changed to "Lord on the very high".
So the Bible was deliberately and deceitfully changed for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Law was canonized in the fourth century C.E. in a series of Commission decisions on snow in Nikai.
Four gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by the simple raising of hands, as if the reality were allowed to accept or refuse to vote.
The manner in which the canon developed depended on what was being read on Sundays in the then - known Christian centers.
What was read the second week after the greatness of the Jerusalem Church?
And what about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually found out that they were approaching the same Gospel accounts.
And so the core of the canon developed out of the ugliness of the early church.
So the council simply accepted as an evangelical any relevant stories that existed among uneducated masses at that time.
Yet, they readily accepted more than ten books from the Bible, even though they referred to them as books that were approved.
Among the rejected items, we find both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer to books that are only words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human writers.
But how could it be so approved if God was the true author of this random mix of legends, similarities, and controversies?
The Bible was certainly written by men and certainly not by too much enlightenment — rather, rather!
That's why so much of her content is historically and scientifically entirely wrong, whatever it is from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believed that snakes and ass could speak, believed in spells, blood victims, ritual spells, magical objects, fires, astrology and five lives of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic spell that they would kill someone, they would cure him from leprosy.
We're talking about people who think kings are predators and bats are birds and whales are fish and drink that's the whole number.
These people believed that when they showed pregnant cowered specimens, they would give birth to a fertilized calf.
How could anyone who knows anything about genetics say this?
The authors of this book, of course, didn't know.
If the Bible were written in a higher form, it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it came from a pear that was really overcrowded and meant to be a literal history, then it would contain nothing of what it contains.
As a moral guide, a total failure is due to the fact that most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigotry savages who overlooked or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, abuse of children, child abuse, kidnapping, rape, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudices against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God’s will.
But creationists are still ignoring this.
Some of their Web sites admit that if any facts are contrary to the Bible, they must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn't have their loving books, they wouldn't have a god.
There's one and the other in their world.
It's ironic that they reject God's "work" as "worshiping creation instead of the Creator".
But they themselves consider man's word to be the word of God and the God of himself, and they even insist that the overthrow of their supposedly "holy" books somehow repels God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians believe that if the Bible is wrong, God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and that the Bible could be wrong at the same time because it is unable to separate doctrine from God.
So it is a type of meditation where believers worship man - made compilations, as if these books were God himself, for they think they are Jehovah’s Word.
Only God has never written or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or refused to say "unchangeable word" to any god has been conceived, formed, grouped, translated, interpreted, corrected, and often intentionally changed and crossed by only the missing people.

In the first class this year, 115 thousand primers appeared.
There will be more than 850 thousand children in primary school and there will be more than 405,000 students in secondary school, estimated by the Ministry of Education.
The new art director of news News is David Fiala
The new art director of news and advertising TV Nova became David Fiala since September 1.
Alan Zarubu, who has led the creative department of the entire Nova group since 1 June.
David Fiala had previously acted in the graphic department of news television Z1.
During the last two years, Alan Zaruby has participated in the implementation of the complete visual changes in news reports Television News, Strêpina, Prásk! and other advertising shows on TV Nova.
David Fiala manages very well the synergy of communication between editorial, study management and the graphic department, which is the essence of the art of the news director.
It has a feel for typography and clean elegant design, which is the way we want to dress in the news screen of Nova," says creative director Nova Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud allegedly was subject to hackers, to the public received our images of celebrity
Screenshot with special files
Meanwhile, the anonymous user on server 4chan publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, alerted the American server Mashable.com.
He reportedly gained incorrect access to user accounts on Apple servers, where the disabled users recorded them through automatic storage of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple hasn't said anything about the problem yet.
A part of the celebrity rejects images as fake, but has already admitted the trueness of the images.
Among them is the actress Jennifer Lawrence known as Katniss in the Hunger Games series or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in the Deathly Trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the images and videos obtained to enrich.
The photos reportedly showed interest in American magazines, according to reports on server 4chan, but hacker prefers money from the community.
According to the The Next Web server, it is very likely that there is a weakness in iCloud security.
On the GitHub server, a tool was found two days ago that enabled you to obtain passwords for your user accounts through hard force, i.e. by automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool was obviously working, but Apple closed the safety hole after two days.
However, it is true that potential attackers had much time to gain access to different accounts before the publication of this tool.
iCloud users should therefore, for preventive reasons, change their password associated with Apple ID.
However, the length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length is at least 12 characters.
The escape of naked images of celebrities should be considered as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are secured many times better than computers in households or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to store on-line explicit photos or any other sensitive content, first encrypt files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set automatic storage of photos from the phone so that it only runs on Wi-Fi and after connection to the charger.
So you will be able to move sensitive images "to security" in time, and you will mainly have the space to erase unauthorized images, so they will not take too much space on the online storage site.

A smart way to save for high school scripts
Given that the price for high school scripts for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, an emerging second-year student came in a wise way to reduce costs.
He invented a system of borrowing books from partners from senior year olds with offer of nominal compensation to keep their sale back.
"The book on calculations, which usually costs 180 dollars, I won the semester for ten and a chicken nugget," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He's lost 120.
According to the University Council, the average student loses more than $1,200 per year for textbooks and grants, but students have different options for how to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is Internet shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
On the rise is the lending of textbooks, which allows students to use the semester of the book, often with a significant discount, before they buy it.
Or Inc running more than 250 bookstores in campus areas says the lending of books has doubled since 2011.
Research in the sector shows that around a quarter of books in university bookstores were borrowed last spring, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the educational texts are purchased according to the National Association of University Trades in Universities.
Here are 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Online shopping
The prices of some new books can be up to a third of the price of the books on the Internet lower than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is nearly $290, but it is possible on the Internet to purchase a new $239.99 at Chegg.com, a retail store specialized in the classroom.
Buy Used
If you do not mind the comments of other people or the consumption and destruction, the appropriate options are used.
At Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says that at Amazon.com he paid 42 cents for the used print "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business".
The new guy was selling for $48.
University Teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, proposes that students check with their students that older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes there are no major changes to the work at the seminars.
If so, the older edition may be sold for a fraction of the price of the last version.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, they are a favorite alternative for buying used books as well eBay Inc's Half.com.
Loans
Also worth considering is the loaned textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the costs for the new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for about $20 a semester.
List the terms and conditions of the transaction in which you borrow the book, including the position of notes, expressions or consumption and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the discount may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-mail
Another option is to take the place of a normal e-book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months for about 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, the most convenient offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for download for free, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go after the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be on the Pepperdine Law School, recommends driving according to the ISBN, because it guarantees that you buy the right book.
Before ordering your book over the Internet, make sure it's really a warehouse, Gault advises.
He convinced himself of it.
The book you bought was sold for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for a book from the university bookstore.
Blah. Blah. Blah.
And then they found guns in the cold torch at the end of the war
This cold is a bit from St. Jiri's church.
We discovered the growth around and began to pull out the flying goose - about a mile and a half of the track and the snowflake.
As we approached the busy day, we hit our head," said Radomil Novák.
We pulled her out, cleaned her up, and found out it was a tortoise of attacking German rifles used by the SS units.
The finding is probably unusual.
According to my information, these rifles were manufactured until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novak added.
All the wooden construction things have spread over time, so it's useless.
Her body, however, is preserved - holding its shape.
How's the cold feeling?
There's one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS units, probably out of fear of being removed.
The fascists on the run would probably not do it.
They threw guns into the woods," she thinks.
The gun was the only thing that the spirits of the Spirit of Jesenika found in the cold.
"There could have been hand grenades, those once around a lot of places, so we slowed down the funeral work, carefully penetrated the bay, so that there was no accident, but there was nothing else down there," Novák approached.
The find ends in a museum depositary at the castle in the nearby Slezsk Rudoltice.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet released the occupied Czech Republic
Exclusive interview Currently.cz with Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of Peruvian separatists.
Kyev/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they're calling me from Donéck," he apologized eight times in an exclusive conversation with Aktuální.cz, Ukrainian General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the Dark Centre for the Liberation of War Prisoners.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban on television.
At every such interruption, it was not possible to ignore the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - who Ruban is explaining himself with his opponent at the other end of the phone.
"That will be it - go there," he married one of the blasc discussions with Doneck and again dedicated himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in custody, some fighter pilot and active participant in anti-government protests in Majdan.
Yesterday, when we were having a conversation, he was in Doneck.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of the Peruvian separatists shall be dedicated to forty-four hours a day.
Currently.cz: You may know that on the side of the Peruvian separatists are fighting the Czechs too.
Our counter-discovery estimates their number to thirty.
It can be much more, though.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I've already freed captured Serbs, Dagestáns, Czechs, one Swedish, Georgians... but not yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we attack your prisoner and we can free him.
Ukrainian soldier occupied by separatists
A.cz: What do you recommend to the Czechs who join the Peruvian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if as Czechs fight in Ukrainian flags of volunteers and separatists take care of them, they will be shot after questioning without mercy, just like any other foreigner.
The separatists consider these men to be tenants, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
For example, if Ukrainian soldiers take over a group of Donetsk separatists - and so do the Czechs - they will put him on the grid and deal with him as a war prisoner.
That man will soon survive.
The Ukrainian side behaves like a state in war.
A.C.: And how many prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand that well, then they'll trade.
Some sources say it's over a hundred men a long time ago.
We've long stopped counting how many people we helped.
But we just released them... from the war, we didn't save them if they decided to continue their fights.
The rescuers are in the war doctors, surgeons, but we definitely don't.
That's it.
And there are more and more coming every day.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to let the prisoners go, and it's just a human request.
A.cz: It is said that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust... as in Ukrainian society.
How have you been able to build respect for both sides of the war?
It's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kyiv gave me the nickname "crazy general with steel balls."
It doesn't bother me.
And maybe that even explains the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Civil Service, I've had some authority before.
I'm never wise, I don't cheat, I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and I speak the truth.
Even when it's the Ukrainian government, or the granddaughter or Luhana, it's very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're gonna torture and kill them.
And that they're crimes.
Often, though, I risk my life, even when I'm being exchanged prisoners and caught... this job for me can mean the end... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many corrections and tortures do you know about prisoners?
... (long silence) To torture prisoners, Ukrainians and separatists are removed from hearings.
I'm sorry.
What about the repairs?
They're only playing on the bottom.
The fact that the Ukrainian army is also correcting the prisoner, I have no information.
No sign that the Ukrainian army is allowed to do something like that.
We have an idea about the amount of repairs, but I can't and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the Peruvian separatists.
Among them are officials, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are seeking independence and perhaps even democracy in Doneck or Luhansk - at least they say so.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists already have the oligars full of teeth and are their unbreakable resistance to life and death.
As we say, they've moved to their throat.
The same dreams and charges were made public in Maydan by the wayside.
And now I'm wondering a little bit: Russia supports separatists and the West rather than the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be big and the other rather small.
This is my sentence, but there's an insurmountable conflict in it.
A.cz: How, for example, does one of the strongest leaders of the Peruvian separatists Igor Bezler appear to you?
Every time I cross the line of war fronts, I'm unarmed and I show soldiers or armed men my bare hands.
And they always have me on both sides of the two hundred or three hundred meters on the male or in the optical lens.
Those faces of people who look at me, I always see good... and they can ever push the trigger of their weapons.
Exhibitor, experienced Colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small government in the great Russian empire.
In any case, he keeps talking about it, and he thinks of Ukraine as some kind of misunderstanding.
He said that such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an insurmountable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we're talking about characters - in a discussion show on Ukrainian television, you've seen your Prime Minister Arsenija Jaceňuk as a weak, helpless and tired "leader", who would do the best if he left quickly.
I'll always get at least five fears in the three hundred meters walk.
So why should I hide with the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is damaging our country?
A.cz: Do you think he shares in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians of Jacenyuk are called "the queen."
And the queen is not in the Ukrainian eyes an animal from which she would be afraid or should have other respect and authority.
His behavior directly copies the Queen's behavior.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister in war he has no right to cry in parliament, to ask him, to play with him his intrigues, to threaten his position... he must run the country, manage it and protect it during the war.
When the country is threatened, the prime minister has no claim to family, friends, rest to pay emotions.
He's the first of Ukraine's ministers.
What about Jaceňuk?
She's acting like a puberty girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he's never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's always complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the markets
Dedicated 3 Sylvester Stallone returned from the $90 million budget in the United States less than $30 million and Sin City: Women for whom I would have returned from the $70 million budget only 12 million.
The movie Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz won only $14.6 million during the first weekend and also movies for children like How to Train Dragon 2 were for film disappointment.
According to Robbie Collins' article on film criticism in Telegraph, children's films are of their own quality.
Collin marked the year 2014 as "the worst" year of children's films and how to train dragon 2 called only "functional" continuation.
When it comes to films based on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the CinemaScore and Metacritical servers and their average rating of summer film premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas during the period between the Day of War Victim and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of viewers and film critics indicate that this year's film rate is similar to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, there may be a change in the access of viewers and a higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s Jungle Book Processing, told Hollywood Reporter’s website: “I think times are changing.”
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what's already happened.
Unlike the current crisis in Hollywood cash markets, Netflix’s profit was $1.2 billion in Internet services, almost twice as much as $837 million last year.
Last year, director Steven Spielberg criticised the study that they rely too much on the right to comics, and predicted "degradation" to Hollywood.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators say that there may be something in his catastrophic age.
With the introduction of possible large cash markets in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimons and the Jursk world, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
Producer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently marked a decline in markets for a simple "cyclical". For Hollywood Reporter said: "Next summer will be the summer of the biggest cash markets in history and no one will worry about selling."
KLDR again threatens Soula, fired another short-flight rocket
North Korea fired another short-flight rocket into the sea, Soul announced.
The alleged missile test was carried out shortly after the completion of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Phjongang sees as a preparation for invasion.
The province of Changang is located in the north-west of the DLR at the Chinese border.
According to the DPA, the South Korean Ministry of Defence spokesmen indicated that the shots were fired from the site in the northwest of the KLDR and flew about 200 kilometers away.
So North Korea apparently first fired a rocket from the province of Changang, launched a South Korean media with a call for military rounds.
In the province there is a subterranean firefighting ramp for Scoud-type missiles.
This is another series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has carried out in recent weeks.
North Korea carried out an unusually large number of rockets and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests were held at the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered at the centre of Newport to take part in the march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff's council meeting, which was described as an anti- Summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation during the weekend and spoke to protestants who traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be transported by air from Blue Mountains
DVA youth tourists were picked up by plane and transported to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
Sixteen-year-old girl and eighteen-year-old man took a trip to Govetts Leap in Blackheat on Sunday afternoon.
When they didn't come home, the relatives called about eight o'clock at the police station.
She was sent to a patrol station, including the local police and rescue team, and a few eleven o'clock was found near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl ran her knee and the man fell down and fell into his head.
The cops stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stabilized state, the ambulance was transferred to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
The breaker brought from Opava only a point, the win was on your foot
The 23-year-old fora could decide, but he didn't succeed in two of the biggest chances.
After the goal, she called mainly about three minutes before the end, but ended up in the network but found out about Opava Joseph Kveton.
I had it on my feet. I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself," Vasiček slept on his head.
"I should probably put it up under the veil, a little bit of it," he guessed.
The defence of Sigmy did not allow the Pope much, except for Mikul's 11-minute drive, which covered the Reichl Golman.
Then they began to push the Hanács, but in the block, the housekeepers did not let them go and shot them from far to wide.
We've been comparing 15 minutes, then we've taken the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the game, and Pope threatened us only from standard situations.
But your chance has not changed, so it ended at 0:0," hated coach Hanák Leoš Kalvod.
The pope also took the point because of the absence in the compound, in addition to the two injured Peter Vavřík and the three-point shooter Peter Ševčík, who are staying in Slezska from Sigma.
It was not possible for them to get ahead of their former policy.
The substitutes deserve an absolute.
Sigma acted more like a football player, but we didn't leave her to anything at one standard," said Slezanů Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and fighting.
Remise is probably deserved, the point is good for us," he added.
Sigma's remise was obtained at four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of Joseph Lébra's club, who, after defeating Znojme, made his million contribution to the rich diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We realized Mr. Lébra's warning, so it can't be that the boys don't want to fight," Kalvoda noticed and at the address of the sleeping shooter Vasicka added: "I believe that it will come and when it hits the target, it will start to fall there.
But after the first hit, I'm gonna set him up right away so he can save his balls for another fight," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino overrun the Benats twice.
The Film Festival otherwise faces a crisis
After much enthusiasm for Birdman's opening film, whose director, Alejandro González Inárritu, took the lead among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the following days showed the impression that the interest of the 71st year festival in Benátka had fallen somewhat.
Whether it was because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen, or because after Birdman they followed the criticisms recognised, but for spectators less attractive images as a genocide document in Indonesia in the 1960s, in view of the silence and other films with the social theme of the American 99 homes after the Iranian story, there were short-lived seats in the cinemas.
Heroes of comics
Even the red blanket before the festival palace has not yet covered such gifts as in the past and allegedly stopped being the problem of getting a place in the hotel for the last time.
The crisis in Italy is talking more than anywhere else, and it is no wonder that it has reached as many institutions as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not due to the lack of personalities, but only in relation to films.
While younger fans desired autographs from comic superheroes by Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had successfully played the dramatic role in 99 homes, the main event of the legendary actor Al Pacina became for all generations without distinction.
He locked it up in two movies right now.
In the story of the screening of the above-mentioned competition, performed by Oscar Barry Levison according to the novel Philip Roth, he has a role for forty-seven years of Pacino, which is close to him: the actor at the top of the fame who suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him on the second day as a strange owner of railways from the rural town of Manglehorn filmed by David Gordon Green was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi’s cup for the best acting performance should not miss it - but still has the artist Pacin’s format of price needs?
Maybe he's the most satisfied person in the audience, and that's especially Italian, because even though he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country his grandparents are from.
Body for Italy
The rest of the Italian film runs very well in Venice this year.
The black souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became after Birdman's first shot with a long-suffered smile.
The Calabria Mafia is viewed in it as a family relationship between clans who fight each other for power and money, and the director was able to satisfy all the requirements for a good movie: a quality script, camera, music and toys.
He also caught up with the chamber psychothriller Cold Heart, who staged the Saverio Costanzo with Albo Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost loses her own child with her keen concern.
On the contrary, French competition films did not welcome the warm welcome of both the Famous and 3 Hearts, both of which are enchanting on the traditional model of consumer films based on the popularity of actors.
But in the end, two really great movies, namely Birdman and Black Soul, aren't so little at the first half of the festival.
And although the festival images have all depressing features, Peter Bogdanoviche's new picture called She's Funny That Way, the funny comedy shown in Venice outside the competition and filmed in the style of the American jolly 40s, has been able to lift the mood for more than one day.
Police caught four producers of pervitin in Prague, vehicles from Poland
"The detectives detained three men in the last days, aged 42, 42 and 37 and a five-year-old woman who produced and sold pervitin drugs in Prague from last November to August," said police spokesman Jan Rössler.
First, on Tuesday, August 12th, an intervention unit in Cillářska street caught a 20-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who appeared in the group as a drug dealer in Poland and a dose dealer.
The following day, the detectives were detained on the basis of the prior consent of the deputy state representative of the next member of the group, a seventy-five-year-old.
The last of four police officers arrived in the mid-morning hours of August 20th in the area of the Montenegrin", the speaker described.
For the transport of drugs from Poland, a third woman received drugs
The main organizer had a wide range of activities.
He produced pervitin, provided various aids and chemicals needed for his production, and provided transportation of medicines with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland, in the works of the airport area, in the garden house in Horomeric, in the apartment in Konjev Street, and elsewhere in Prague.
He also weighed the drug he had manufactured, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold pervitin.
With the transportation of drugs from Poland or the sale of drugs, he was helped by a woman who had not yet been punished.
For this she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drugs produced," Rössler added.
On the basis of the judge's order, the criminals also carried out several home visits, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, payloads, injection syringes, pens and other aids and items that may be considered as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"Then, from the available records, the police found that since 1995, the chief organizer had been fully sentenced to seven times as a property offence, the woman was not sentenced," the police spokesperson added.
The latter was detained in 2006 on condition that he was convicted of a criminal offence of sexual abuse and the 70-year-old car mechanic who has been imprisoned for free has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
Even with him, it was mostly for property crime.
The investigator accused three men and women of committing a criminal offence of unlawful production and other handling of fraudulent and psychotropic substances and poisons, which threatens them to be imprisoned for up to ten years.
Finally, three persons were asked by the investigator to encourage the State representative to propose that they be arrested, where they were finally placed by the judge," the speaker said.
The fourth defendant, a seventy-year-old recidivist, ended up free.
His position and role in this case was not as fundamental as that of the other accused.
The cops are still working with this man.
Ferrari is offering wood and carbon chess.
Ferrari offers within its other products very interesting things at many "interesting" prices.
As a good example, it may be handmade chess with a playing board of 42 x 42 cm size in Italy.
If you like it, prepare more than CZK 40,000.
The exact price is 43 405 CZK.
The customer obtains a set of wood black and red lacquered figures stored in a wooden box coated with carbon fibers.
Probably no one will be surprised that the classic riders have a figure of riding horses.
If you do not feel that chess is a valuable gift, you should also have the Ferrari 500 F2 model (of course manually) produced at 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
A drop in high school and high school doesn't make any sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics also show that the gymnasiumists have good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
Great preparations have been made in schools in the last fourteen days.
Most of these are routine matters, such as the transfer of flowering from the summer warehouse back into class and threading the wings.
They're going to have a little bigger spring on the fire gym.
A few days before the start of the season, they search for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature in the library.
There was no robbery or fraud, a four-year high school in Gorica opens and renews its activity after three years.
Not on the public, but on the private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the inability of the founders.
They had to wait to see if the school's existence would be confirmed by taking into the school register managed by MSMT.
"The French socialists should shut down and put France in order," key associate Francoise Holland says
Valls calls on the left to "show his support" to the war-run Socialist President whose new division of functions was not met with the agreement of the majority of the French.
The President deserves general respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said and noticed.
As a peaceful gesture, the president of the government maintained that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour work week, despite the passionate suggestions by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister who proposed to free herself at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, the Netherlands asked the Socialists to remain "consistent" with the government.
Christian Taubirová, Minister of Justice, but she made a series of budgets when she appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist side for her "the French have lost faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, a leader of extremely conservative rights, with unresolved internal disputes between the socialists, when she declared that she did not assume that the new Walls government would last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked as well as Prince Manuel Valls. They were forced to establish a new government when the previous government did not last until the end of the year.
"And the new won't last until the end of the winter or winter," Le Pen told his supporters.
She reiterated her call for Parliament's dissolution and declared that she was convinced that it could win the preliminary elections and that she was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections and in May was extremely conservative in the elections to the European Parliament.
According to a survey of the public opinion of the Journal du Dimanche, 76% of the French feel that the Socialist Party is at risk of dividing itself into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch period in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a politician at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French will soon be patient if the new socialist government is unable to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that changes are happening in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art Prague no longer limits elections
Changes to the relevant notices should be prepared and approved until the new management of the capital.
The streets of Prague will not disappear before the municipal elections next game and the city will not limit street art.
There's no limit to even marrying a dog.
Prague shall not reach the October elections to prepare and approve the amendment of the declarations in question in the form of a representative.
"The change decision should also not make the current city leadership that ends in a few weeks' term of office," said Councillor Lukas Manhart (TOP 09).
Canceling a lot of gambling in your territory in recent weeks has been decided immediately by several councillors, such as Prague 5 and 7.
But Herny's not going away. The gambling announcement isn't going to change yet.
It's the task of new city leadership after election.
Now we wouldn't even technically achieve that, for example, due to deadlines for commenting, and so on," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current representative, which must be approved by the amendment of the notice, will take place on 11 September.
The referendum on a comprehensive ban on gambling will be held on the day of the municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
At the present time, for example, there is a ban on gambling in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The statement will not change for the same reasons, even in the case of street art, so-called busking.
In particular, Praha 1, who has already sent the magistrate a proposal for places that would want to expand the current list of prohibited places.
The musicians also don't want Prague 5 around Angela.
The call for dogs to marry the city is coming for several months, so far it's not finished.
The location of theheren and the problem of busking solves city announcements.
It can only be issued or adjusted by the representative of the capital.
Counsellors only have an advisory vote, they don't have to issue statements themselves.
Last week, he placed the victory of Scottish independence proponents to reach the hand
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making this mistake the second time when it almost put on billboards throughout Scotland asking whether Scotts wanted to be rich.
But you won't get to the hearts of the Scottish fans by appealing to their money, or you won't get their respect when you start threatening them.
The morale of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, even though only a few Scottish people still go to church today.
Scotts have a far greater tendency to get the changers out of the temple than to let them dictate how they should vote.
The head of the Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and that is why he repeatedly questioned his rival, Unionist Darling, whether he is willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people", if Scottish voters would vote for independence, and begin to support the single currency for Scotland and England.
It caused Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and the London financials, and he fell into this trap with the grizza.
Of course, Darling doesn't support the command of Scottish volunteers.
However, the discussion about what Scotland will have in its currency has already been largely neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, work opportunities and the defence of public health that citizens have free of charge.
Darling supported the London bankers on the issue of currency and also raised the impression that he would not protest against privatisation of health.
As Salmon said, he went into bed with the conservatives.
This is a very dangerous situation for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish volunteer knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with a conservative.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to the fans, but to the "boss" association, to the Confederation of the British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameroon's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmon was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a free absent home.
Scotts would respect him if he came to debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron at least managed to say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that. It's almost a physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scotts don't jump and have to accept what they are.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic start of school according to Milos Urban
Illustration of the story Longest Year
Miloš Urban Longest Year
The end of the holiday was at least the best, the last week that was gone, and we were just having a good time with Grandma summer, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes, when you could get from Tuzex, the boots from East Germany.
The reading of the Quick Arrows, already falling down, the lighting on the wheels up around the Imperial to the back behind the Vary, somewhere in the tennis courts, was no longer there, the sun cooled back and shoulder, stuck the paprika on the divorced.
Tonight, a slight nervousness, still a holiday regime, sleeping until midnight, in a week it will get worse, just a few minutes before sleeping, then get up at 7:00 in the morning.
It'll be Monday.
Most people don't. On the contrary, summer is a cruel curse before school.
To be used in the spectacular light on the plate and to look like a plastic stand in the glass load, there is the school, U.S.A.
The backdrop with a ludicrous pink hug, and the old familiar faces before it and a few new, more attractive boys, more girls.
There they're creepy, avoiding them, just as interesting as they're always holding together and how they're here soon.
And these grown-up girls who came screaming, they're laughing at something hysterically now, probably something has changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything's in my old place.
And again, the new cousins, some nerves and other pleasures, why are they even lying here?
Because it has to, educational war obligation.
So inside, the cold moisture of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolgirl with the mop, unfortunately still the same one who borrows the disciple key from the sheet box, where the disciples can be kept and who are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dress stays in memory, now it's not, it's pretty airy, but it'll get worse in a week.
It's just the idea that the stomach is spinning and the headache starts.
A head that even worse is learning from mathematics, that devilish game for chosen ones, which I don't belong to, and I'll never be.
Once again, the three and four, the lack of five, hide before the test, get into the lab and get the best out of it, be there and not be there, just exist as a name in the classroom and dream so far about nicer girls and beautiful buildings, about antennas in space where no one bothers anyone, does not humiliate anyone, and does not encourage anyone's feet.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now as it was years ago.
The daughter of his birth died.
It threatens her to an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in a public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without the help of strangers, she was born a girl who, after she had cut the cane, hid under the hood and took it to a road guide, where she was put into a few thousand metres from the road.
She was born on her way to school
I think it came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
I needed to go to the bathroom on the bus. I was born there.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut off the poppy rope with the knives I wore in school," she described the defendant and said she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"The next day she went back to the place, put the child's body in the trunk and drove it away, took the body out of the trunk, packed it into a black igelite bag and hid it and left it under the stairs of her grandmother's house in Havlíčka's Broda," they stand in the complaint that it is not quite obvious when Newborn's death occurred.
It could have been in ten minutes, but even hours after birth, breathing when covered by the blanket or when you put it under your coat, underfreezing or bleeding from an unsweetened spoon.
A similar scenario was repeated next year in spring.
A woman in the near unknown period from February to April 12th, when the infant was found by random witnesses under the crusader at the fisherman in Havlíčkobrodska, gave birth in secret.
This time in the bathroom of the basement apartment in the family house.
Without checking whether she had been born alive, without cutting off and cheating on the doll that was wrapped around her neck, she put the child into several plastic bags, including Igelite bags, and left him in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon hours, he and his former partner were taken to the fisherman.
She was finally hit by a friend.
The father of both children was just a friend of the defendant, who apparently didn't know about the partner's pregnancy.
Even for this reason it is not now before the court; it was only punishable for a sin against the funeral law.
He was also the one who went to the police later.
I don't like him being punished as a partner.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know that my solution was wrong, but it came to me as a human being at the time," she did not hide the indignation of the defendant, who allegedly suffered and feared him in relation to the man.
During her statement, a young woman spoke fairly.
Tears welled up in her eyes until she spoke about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after she reached adulthood.
She didn't want to kill
"They come after me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she said.
I didn't wear my equipment because I didn't want my kids, I felt young.
I wanted to put Furt in the baby box, but I don't know what happened. I didn't.
I can't explain that to you," the judge answered.
She refused, however, to act with the thought and intention of killing a newborn.
According to her claim, the second child was born dead.
Even in pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I've restricted it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I also restricted smoking," she said.
Although pregnancy was seen in both cases, all on repeated questions claimed that she had a health problem that she was pregnant.
And that's a friend.
The main judgement will continue at the Court of Justice in Tuesday's statements of the judges.
A judgment could already be reached on Wednesday.
A woman is threatened with a criminal rate of up to 18 years in prison, possibly with an exceptional penalty.
Norwegian Cruise is nearing the three-billion-dollar purchase of Prestige Cruise
According to sources known to the whole case, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the third largest shipping company in the world, has advanced to purchase Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately three billion dollars.
The Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, which competes with higher Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), has provided access to luxury cruise ships and rich customers.
The agreement can be published this week, he made up the source Sunday, but he warned that the deal still doesn't have to end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% share in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want to be named because the proceedings are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the request for a comment, spokesperson Apollo refused to comment on the situation.
Norwegian Cruise is located in Miami and operates thirteen sailing ships in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, by 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the flags of Oceania and Regent, which together owns eight voyages to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company announced markets of $1.2 billion, 6% more than in the previous year.
It is expected that in the coming year, the ninety billion segment of sailing will benefit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies such as China and India.
The companies compete for these customers to become the preferred option for the selection of sailing vessels.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public offer in January 2014.
Apollo has a majority share in the company since 2007 since the closure of the business of $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it came to contact the tour operator Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of companies dealing with leisure and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo to Norwegian Cruise invested one billion dollars.
Norwegian Cruise launched a stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration of the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting owned a share of 28 %, Apollo 20 % and private investment company TPG Capital LP 8 %.
According to the registration documents, the first public offer includes Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises as a whole 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Pro-democratic activists in Hong Kong provoke the Chinese authorities on the day following the vote decision
There was a group of people loyal to Beijing who had a Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Commission of the National Congress approved that only two out of three candidates were elected in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of the appointing committee, which is likely to consist of members of the faithful Beijing.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get to the polls and admit pro-democratic activists to renew their promises and protect the financial centre of Hong Kong's protests of the "Employment of the Central".
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tension, and Chinese leaders are afraid that the demand for democratisation will be extended to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report on the Chinese government's power in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists organised an informal referendum on elections in the special official district and hundreds of thousands of people entered and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference, attended by Prime Minister Li, is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, several press conferences were also held by the Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Zhang Ronghsun Legislative Committee and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong State Council and Macau Feng Wei.
Student activists declared that they were meeting in front of the Hong Kong government's office this afternoon.
By the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain had never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kyev to open negotiations with eastern Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to a description of the events by Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin requested that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately open negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the derelict areas.
His spokesperson Dmitrij Peskov later explained that Putin did not intend to suggest that the eastern Ukraine areas under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed so that the Russian speaking area would have the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call on the Kyiv government to deal with the pro-russian rebels as equals, is in line with a clear strategy, according to which it has been operating since the break-up of the riots five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novorussian real independence so that it can connect to the West.
In an interview for the first state television channel Putin condemned Ukrainian military action, which was to regain the eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, which ruled separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently occupied the territory were designated as "Novorus" or "New Russia", a term that refers to the famous days of the Russian pre-revolutionary empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words, according to which "the prison is illustrating" everyone who believes that peaceful negotiations are under consideration, because Ukrainian politicians started ahead of parliamentary elections on October 26th, while government units are attacking civilians in the areas of controlled separatism.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately begin meaningful negotiations and not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the status of State sovereignty of the South Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's attack on state sovereignty was thought of in the context of wider autonomy, which has been conducted by Kyev for months and is intended to mitigate the concerns of Russian speakers in the areas of cultural and language rights.
Peskov stated that the necessary autonomy can only be granted to the eastern region by the Ukrainian government.
It is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The progress of the spokesperson Kreml, who was to correct the "wrong interpretation" of Putin's remarks, stressed the Russian leadership's approach to resolving the rise of the separatists in the east, which is different from the open siege of Crimea, where most of the two million people are from ethnic Russians.
Moscow should be much more difficult to annex even Donéck and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and public opinion polls, which have been conducted before the conflict, have shown widespread support for the settlement in Ukraine.
The autonomy of the Russian diplomats acting on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, thus giving Kremlin a real control over the territory that would connect the Russian fortress with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is home to the main Russian maritime fleets, the seabed and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also the center of the downs, the factory and the yard, which produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his opening speech on 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislators - after new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give different regions more control over their finances and language status.
This vision of autonomy is very different from that of Kremlin and separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and encouraging violence.
Putin's last call to Kyiv to act as separatists followed the next procedure of the rebels last week after the Russian units and tanks penetrated eastern Ukraine from the former peaceful area along the Azovo Sea.
The separatists of the Russian forces took control of Novoazovske in such a way that the Ukrainian security authorities are afraid that it is a move to occupy the strategic coastal area up to Crimea.
This accelerated the huge civil and military effort to secure Mariupol, a port with metalurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants lying between Novoazovsk and a narrow entrance gate on the Crimean peninsula.
The riot on Saturday took place at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels and called for an action that would prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," warned Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the case of an unspecified scale of the Ukraine crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovakia after last week two columns of Russian armed vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Danube area to support the separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were arrested in Ilovakia during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian settlers arrested in Ukraine's home country a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
In the scandal with discovered photos are also complicated Australian celebrities and Gabi Greeko
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disappointment at the hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is shocked when in the biggest scandal with hacked photos the celebrity got on the internet a series of explicit photos by Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker claims to have sixty photos with a naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevenne, singer Rihanny, Ariany Grande and Ley Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Because of the escape from iCloud, the public reportedly also received personal images of Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Greek.
There's 101 Celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked for his hand last month, told the magazine Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, according to online reporters, reported that hacking is “unscrupulous” and those who have become its target are“degradable”.
It's supposed that the hacker got 30 photos of Palmer with a former friend Scott Speedman, including two images on which he unwinds at the pool.
Palmer acted, for example, in the movie Love and honor where her opponent Liam Hemsworth was.
Palmer, the star television series Chuck Strahowski and the actress from the Thriller Sugar Punch Browning yesterday did not comment on stolen images.
The representative of Lawrence TMZ said: "This is a clear breach of privacy."
The actor Seth Rogen hacker on his Twitter criticised: “Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The footballers Sigmy Lebra agreed, without winning
Olomouc - Chromiums and lightnings that the collaborator of the Olomooc Sigmy Josef Lébr sent to his subordinate last week appear to be past.
Whether they're from Opava, they're only bringing a point behind a free remise.
They just got a little comfortable with the ambush and the fighting of the club boss.
Money for payouts could soon come to the club.
"I'll let another match, as I talked about last week, but I'm far more optimistic," Lebr confirmed, despite the fact that Sigma didn't win, the players convinced her with improved performance.
The battle and the ambush that we played mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive that he won't win.
If we were to play like this from the beginning of the season, I'm sure we haven't lost yet," Lebre thinks.
Sigma in Opau stopped the initial pressure of the home, then the game was balanced, and in the second half it was better.
After the victory, Kalvod’s faithful men won, but they did not reach their goal, and they could not win.
The result is not what we think it is.
To our full satisfaction, we were lacking but only one chance changed," said Lebr, who does not think that the change in the access of footballers only threatened him.
There must have been more aspects.
Whether on my side, on the side of the coach, or the fans," Lebr said.
With pressure, Sigma must be counted
The players didn't want to comment much after the game in Opau last week.
I'm trying to put these things away completely.
I tried not to let it go," the young hairdresser, Michal Reichl, struck his head.
Then, without comment, he left a question about Lébro's statement from last week's attacker Václav Vasiček, who did not change Sigma's biggest opportunity in the Saturday match.
After all, he was just talking a little bit about the pressure.
We're still under pressure.
Everyone wants to pull on us.
Today we've shown that if we fight and drive everyone in the ass, it'll go," he said.
Warnings Has Come to the Heart
Even Leo Kalvoda’s viewer did not argue that preparation for the match was not the easiest in view of the atmosphere that was prevailing in Olomoci last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that Mr. Lebra's warning was taken to heart.
Even though it wasn't about not wanting to fight and blow it off before," the break-up coach passed.
It was like today's first fifteen minutes.
It took us a while to compare ourselves with the fortress and realize what the other league is about.
That it's not just football, it's mostly fighting," Kalvod said.
There's only hope that in the next match, Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I would love to believe it," he added.
