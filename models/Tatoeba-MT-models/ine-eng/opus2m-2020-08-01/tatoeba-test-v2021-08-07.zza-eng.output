I'm not going to make it.
Analyst needs root.
Is that what it is?
Did you get it?
What do you know?
What's the matter with you?
How's it going?
You're ready to go?
I'm afraid so.
He's gonna be all right.
Have you ever seen Tom grow a cow?
What's wrong with you?
Is this the end of the line?
Take care of yourself!
Good evening.
I'm so sorry.
Good and big.
Are you sure you don't want to laugh?
And it's all new.
Dicki's like, "I don't think so."
How's it going?
Is that what you're saying?
Is that what you're coming for?
Is that how you feel?
Why don't you ask me?
You know what?
Is it Tomi's turn?
Did you say anything like that?
Qalé is my twin.
I don't know.
I'm gonna be tough.
I swear to God, I'm sorry.
I can't wait to see you.
The amount of time each player has to move in the sky map.
I'm sorry.
I'd love to.
I'm done.
Is that the source of nino?
Did you know that she's pregnant?
Did he grow old?
Who's the fat guy?
Who's this, what's wrong with you?
What's the matter with you?
Is that your yeno coming?
Did he fall asleep?
Did you send him back to Europe?
"It's not me?" "No."
What's the matter with you?
Don't you want to cry?
Key is Emily.
It's too bad Tommy.
No, my God, I am not born.
And you're an old man.
It's okay.
This is a joke!
It was the coldest part of the night.
It's no wonder she's home.
That's what I'm talking about.
So take care of her.
This is Tommy.
Hanni at Nanni Dıleté.
What's the matter?
Tom's on duty?
What's the matter with you?
That's what I'm talking about.
It's so hot.
And my name is xu or va.
It's too late.
That's what I'm talking about.
He's safe.
That's how she feels.
Your right foot is full.
It's not true.
And, of course, it's your turn.
Tom'o never did.
That's not what I'm talking about.
That's right.
It won't take long for that to happen.
And he is closer to the well.
And you're so cool with your hair.
This is the van's corner.
I'm sorry.
Tommy's payroll.
You're gonna drink it.
It could have been dark.
The euro is not enough.
Don't take it easy.
The closer you feel, the closer you feel.
It's high and it's good.
I'm sick and shit.
Is that how you feel?
Are you out of your mind?
It's Tom's daughter-in-law.
What about the euro?
Don't you know why we're dying?
How long have you been doing this?
What's the lockdown?
I'm gonna kill you!
I am new.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm not afraid
I'll be right back.
He's in the middle of nowhere.
It's over.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
She's in love.
It's the secret of all being, of course, the secret of all being.
That's Tom.
I'll try my best.
I'm just trying to make sure you don't want to.
I'm not gonna take that anymore.
Zee, what is she gonna do?
I like the mask of my feet.
It's just that it's just the network that's going to blow up.
He's not gonna make it.
It's too late to make a move.
It's hot!
The earth's orbit is sharper than ever before.
No, I'm not afraid
You're welcome.
It's all right, Tom.
I don't know.
What's wrong with you?
You don't know.
I don't have a rocket.
I'm not afraid.
It won't hurt. It's cool.
I want you to edit it.
What's the matter with you?
Do you know what Tom looks like?
She's pregnant, she's pregnant.
Ez Tomra you don't have.
I don't know what Tommy's doing.
It's not that bad.
I'm not the only one who's flying.
It's not the coldest winter I've ever met.
The euro is the only way to get away with it.
I won't be late.
It isn't European nor won't be European.
It's winter.
You can't take the heat off your ass.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm afraid so.
He's right here.
You don't know what to do with all the heat.
You're welcome, you're welcome.
It's Tommy's menu.
What's wrong with you?
It's okay, Tommy.
His wife is dead.
I've been sold a few peyhesyayas.
I sold and bought a peyhesyaya.
We're gonna be all over again once we've got through this.
No, it's not a big deal.
Most people don't like it anymore.
It's good to meet you.
I don't know.
It wasn't your turn to roll.
It's very likely that the system will rise.
I'm kidding.
She is so much appreciated by the people.
There's a lock on the door.
There's a network.
There's nothing wrong with that.
He wants to wake up and cry for help.
I don't think so.
I'm out of the horse's bag.
But the closer we get to the mirror, the stronger it becomes
It's about the euro.
No need for an open house.
Eddie's week.
I'll see. Are you okay?
Ezi is back!
You're fucking niya, aren't you?
I'm sorry.
It's just a drink.
He's squeezing that way.
It was a very serious announcement.
That's right.
He is there and is there.
That's not true.
That's not true.
Eza is gone.
It's your turn. I'll take care of you.
It's a secret.
You have already seen a locker.
I don't know.
Well, I guess it's not a day.
I'm sorry.
It's been a long time.
I'm gonna be fine with you.
I'm in Keyaya and I'm in charge.
In the summer.
I'm sorry, Tom.
Does Paul have Lily's handkerchief?
Ujad do you want this?
Don't I kiss?
Are you all right, Tom?
Tom's client?
Tom Xinto?
Who's that?
It's your turn to fall.
It's time to finish.
It's just that Tom and Mary were together.
I'm sorry, Tom.
It's time for the show.
It's okay.
My father loved me.
It's my fault.
Oh, who's coming for me?
We had a funny cry.
I've had a lot of fun.
Oh, my God.
The ercan.
By no means!
I'll be fine.
No, you're not.
I don't know.
He's got to go to bed with his wife.
It's wintertime.
From the time of the check.
I'm in the van.
It was too late.
His mother drew back with her voice
It's like 32" in a row.
You won't be able to do that.
Qayila and I'm fine.
It won't take long for nothing more.
I mean, Mary's been drinking like a baby.
She doesn't know what to expect in the months.
It's the thickest place in the world.
It's my turn to roll.
I'm sorry.
It won't take long for nothing.
I mean, that kind of thing.
I'm fine.
It's my fault, Charley.
That's why the hot dog was dead.
The end of the day.
I'm fucking with you!
He's in the middle of nowhere.
You're on your way.
Note, I'm not crazy.
Don't ask me this again.
Well, don't sit down.
I don't know what to do.
I wouldn't believe it.
But Tom's a drunk.
Hey, hey, hey!
It's Mary teweno.
Mary did not know me.
Mary's rent.
Mary and Zana.
Mary was hurt.
Sewl is Mary's.
"Ez?" "Eh, Ti!"
My sister loved Thomas.
You're my friend.
The others closed their doors, Jack.
I'll be damned if you'll excuse me.
I'm gonna drink to the bathroom. I'm gonna get a drink.
You're so cool with me.
I'm a good friend.
His heart is so hot
Maya and me.
My name is Maria Saraya.
I don't know about that.
That's why you're here.
No one's gonna die.
You don't even know a cat?
You can't do it.
Don't you think so.
No hint available.
I don't want you to do that.
You won't be less than just a few minutes.
Maybe I don't pay for it.
I'm sorry.
It wasn't my fault.
No. He's hot.
I'm sorry.
That's what this is all about.
You won't know who I am anymore.
Red, made fae'mchered
That's better.
It's all dark.
That's enough.
Right - a little, left - a little..., pear pear.
And your father says to me, "What's the smell?"
And it's not like hesker's shirt.
It's your turn.
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
Your right foot hit me.
It's a nebula.
Oh, my God.
I don't care what you're saying.
And she's got her own house, and she's got her own house.
My dad would say, "What's wrong with you?
I lost my queen.
She's got a nice wife.
The key's too high.
The crash will be caused by the crash.
And the key to the bear.
What's wrong with you?
Come on, Timmy.
Jew man.
He's the only girl in the world.
He's got a hole in his neck.
Get out of the way.
He's in the bathroom, he's in the bathroom.
Syanra is a big player.
I'm gonna have an old man.
And I'm gonna have an old man.
I'll see you tonight.
Don't you dare!
He'll never see you again.
I'm gonna have to go.
No, it's not my fault.
That's it.
Tom Niyo.
You're right, aren't you?
No, it's not.
There's no need to complicate his life.
It's springtime.
It's worth a while.
It doesn't matter.
And I know what it's like.
Just keep quiet.
I'd like to see some germs.
Oh, my God.
I'll be right back.
Keynek's got a paycheck.
History of the seashore.
Muted
It's too hard to rock.
Let's go. Let's go.
That's it, my lord.
No such key.
There's no space left in that room but a rock.
Ice pellet
I think I'm good.
Rock and avan.
Serseya, but you're sweet.
I'll be right down.
I'll be right back.
It's on the ground floor.
This isn't a good idea.
This isn't going to work.
This is Mary's friend.
You must love her dead.
I'll keep you safe.
It's over.
It's egile niyé.
It's stuck.
Yeah, and zerre.
I'm sorry.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
It won't take long for nothing.
Come on, man.
Oh, thank you.
The end of the canvas.
At the price of ya.
No, no, no.
Well, that's what I'm talking about.
You're safe.
Well, you're welcome.
It's just that Tom.
Tom prayed.
Tom, what's wrong with you?
Tom doesn't look, does he?
Tom's not the fault.
What's Tommy's dream?
Tom, enjoy it!
Tom and hard.
Tom, this is the new wine!
Tom, I don't know where it is.
Tom's gonna die.
Tom took Jackie's hand.
I don't want to see you.
Tom zey toya niyo.
Tom fucked his ass.
Tom's gone.
Your old Tom, it's me.
Tommie's heart went out to her.
Take it and make a mistake.
I'm so sorry.
Tom's pretty cool.
It was too late for Tom.
Tom's name is Mary.
There are 28 locks left.
Tom's funny.
Awa Tommy was there.
Tommy's gonna be there.
Tommy was Mary's key.
It's cancer.
Tom and I know.
I'm new to Tom.
The twins.
Tommy and Boy Kerd.
Tom fucking niyo.
I'm out of here.
Tom's in the middle of his mind.
That's why I'm here.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Tom will be back in the morning.
Tom died.
Tom's dead.
I'll see you later.
Tom just laughed.
Sweet Tom.
Tom, are you kidding me?
Don't look at Tomdo's keyed.
Tomdo, he's never seen anyone before.
Tomdo qayte is good.
You're not left in Tom's room.
Tomdo is here.
Tom was taken to bed.
Tusnelda is an Armenian actor.
Tusnelda is an Armenian actor.
You're done with your feet and your feet.
That's good for me.
It's our turn.
After all, I'm fine.
Candé in good paw.
Oh, my gosh. I'm gonna show you what this is like.
I'm sorry.
It's my birthday party.
This topic is not relevant.
He won't mind my dinner.
I'll take my lead.
My son-in-law Qayte is fine.
I'm gonna have to show you what I'm doing.
I don't know.
I don't know Tommy.
My job.
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
We're done!
What's Tom doing?
I'll bet you didn't.
I'm sorry.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
Made Tomi tommy tommy.
You're welcome.
Don't worry about it.
Oh, my God, I'm so glad to be here.
But he did.
But he's gone.
Take your time.
I won't tell you what to do.
It's just the end of my story.
I'll be right back.
It's the hottest part of my life.
It's about to fall.
It's a beer.
If you don't know what to do.
Mayé Eriné.
I'll see you soon.
Sit down.
You are my friend.
You're welcome.
It's about time.
I'm sorry, Tom.
I don't know if it's true.
- Shut up! - Shut up!
My tears welled up Toma.
It's summer time.
Made him feel better.
Is that why I'm freaking out?
What time is it?
What's the problem?
It's okay?
Is that you?
Is that right?
Or am I gone?
You're still going to fall?
Are you sure about Tomdo?
A euro for yourself?
What's her name?
Who's that?
No matter what happens, it's just a little bit more serious.
Is that gonna be so cool?
What, you're hot with this, you're hot with this?
"The date is the date?" "The date is the end!"
You're a friend of yours?
Is that a savl savl' yu vei?
Do you want to keep this secret?
Did you get her?
What's the deal with that?
Who's that Tom's aunt?
How many keys is that?
What's the matter with you?
Where's our tip?
We're sweating, aren't we?
What are we gonna do?
Where about?
At the price of where?
Where's that?
We're a cat?
If they hadn't escaped, they'd have been killed.
Do I know where the cow is?
What's the matter with her?
How's Tom Boston doing?
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you know what's going on?
You don't know what you're talking about?
What's the matter with you?
Did you ever drink?
Did you fall in love with him?
And, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way!
It's a warm, warm rock.
He came to me later.
As the snow fell, the snow fell.
It's the first time I've ever seen him.
His nose was deep in his throat.
Is that the source of nino?
Pizza is bis.
He'll be fine at the moment.
You're a stranger.
He hasn't been edited yet, so it's a big deal.
It's been a long time, isn't it?
Are you ready?
You're welcome.
That's right, that's right.
It's not too late.
It's too late.
You're doing this, aren't you?
I don't know who you're talking about, do you?
It's okay.
