Members of the Galles Assembly are concerned about "making the figure of strawberries"
The proposal to amend their title in the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Parliament of Wales) is perceived to be consensual among some members of the Assembly.
This proposal is a result of the programmes to change the name of the Assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the whole political arena Assembly are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his party is concerned that "it can take a stand with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who don't live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means dick and pwp means cock.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group in the whole "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Galese Conservative Party claimed to be "open" towards the change of name, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (pagliaccio).
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is spoken in a similar way to the English statement of the Yorkshire letter U.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which is currently in the process of introducing amendments to the names, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what Members of the Assembly will be called will of course be a debate for Members themselves."
The law of the Galles Government of 2017 granted the Gales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which has been widely supported by the possibility of calling the Galles Parliament.
As regards the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission has expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Galese Parliament), but MWP has received greater consent in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties of reaching consensus could be shown a thank-you for President Elin Jones, who should present a legislative proposal on the amendments within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further amendments to the functioning of the Assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will receive the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians refer to the referendum on the amendment of the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the name of their country in "North Macedonia."
The popular vote was organised in an attempt to put an end to a dispute for decades with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territories and has repeatedly opposed its requests for membership to the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opposer of the plebiscite for the change of name, said that he would not consider the result of the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is simply the price to be paid in order to be able to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells sit down while Harlem's churches are in trouble.
"The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
"Today there's none of the two."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood halls that people regularly attend."
As far as churches are concerned, the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will come back to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with condominiums filled with people who will not help the rest of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and for this reason they will rush the moment when these churches will shut down because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by brothers before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The early white Methodist congregation went there in the 1930s.
A black congregation in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation with the chief Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycotting against the 125th street vendors, one of the main streets for shopping in Harlem, who refused to take over or promote color people.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners planned his reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the "poor bells."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a color musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who passed to a larger carillon to the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by the lay leaders of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, consisting of the lay leader, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese "tryed to download the costs" on the parish assembly although the latter had not been involved in the reception of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Squalo woundes a 13-year-old in dive fishing turtles in California
Official sources say that on Saturday a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while he was immersing himself in search of Aragos in California during the opening day of the Aragos season.
The attack took place shortly before 7 in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that for half an hour he was immersing himself with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and swimming up to him and a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm due to the capture of an aragist but then "he realized that the boy was shouting 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His whole key was locked," Hammel said he had noticed once he reached the boy.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego, where he was covered under critical conditions.
The species of the sword responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said during a communication to the media that some weeks earlier he had been sighted in the area a shark, but that he had been declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper area of the chest.
The authorities have prohibited access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablanca to Swami's to Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's programme a push towards beauty products in the UK
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with courses dedicated to the beauty products of the large store assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the important drive to the beauty products market of 2.8 billion sterlings in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow as sales in fashion and household items decline, the largest courses dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 shops in the country and adopted in several shops next year if successful.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting new ways to use space on drawers once dedicated to televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double the size of its offer of articles for beauty until it reached 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those present in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most of the products are vegan - an ever-increasing quality required by the younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will experience the authorizations in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which he opened in Croydon, in southern London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a move towards buying small quantities of food every day at small district stores have forced supermarkets to commit themselves more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, said that the points sold will be more and more like the big stores while the supermarket chain tries to resist discount resistance such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and has also introduced several Habitats since he bought the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has given rise to food sales and has made the most profitable acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reduce its beauty and pharmaceutical product departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenue from pharmaceutical sales points in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's three years ago sold its pharmaceutical business of 281 points sold to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was expected to play a part in the program, adding in four stores a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet all needs and the inviting environment and comfortable positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "whispered" after Holly Willoughby comes out of an 11 million-dollar deal
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones is angry after the TV shower Holly Willoughby withdrew from a 11 million sterling contract with his trend mark to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of real housewives and accessories anymore.
The activity of the couple was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's.
This morning's presenter, 37 years old, appealed to Instagram to announce his abandonment.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, angry after withdrawing from their profitable trend mark activity at the last minute to focus on his new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "angrily" when the TV gold girl admitted to a tight meeting at the headquarters of his commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts - for a value of 1.5 million pounds - did not leave them enough time to dedicate themselves to their brand of households and accessories True.
The activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and it was calculated that it would double the property of Willoughby, estimated around 11 million pounds.
Not only willoughby, 37 years old, chose Instagram to announce his abandonment of True, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday residences.
According to one source: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It was supposed to be his future over the long term that he would be committed to for the next twenty years.
His decision to abandon has left all the people involved absolutely without words.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow's headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that leaving the presenter of this Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions because of strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and because of possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby invented True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, he joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent their holidays together and Jones owned a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as guest of the ITV program "I'm A Celebrity".
A source near Jones said last night that "he does not want to comment on his business."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would have received from the media to make a comment that some would have judged "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "tele-journal driver".
"I didn't give up on anything."
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first event in Singapore in June was called by Trump as a huge step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearisation are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the United Nations General Assembly held on Saturday, which North Korea did not see a "equivalent" response from the United States to the first disarmament operations in North Korea.
He stressed, however, that the United States is continuing to impose sanctions to maintain high pressure.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we are achieving excellent results," he said.
"We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results: the end of the missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the return of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's simple to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who are trying to get into this crowded field, we'd have about 200 people right here in front," Trump said, indicating the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were notified that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been displaced, national emergency was not declared, an essential requirement to activate international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it is a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to join Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly subjected, the country continues to be terribly prepared in the face of the wrath of nature.
Although shelters have been built at the tsunamis in Aceh, this is not a common structure at other costs.
The obvious lack of an alarm siren for tsunamis in Palu, although the alarm was given, has probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
Under the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put in the centre of his campaign the improvement of Indonesia's brand-new infrastructure and has invested money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has hit Joko's administration while preparing for re-election next year.
Joko must also face pressures from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands away from their homes because of clashes on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimental weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge del Liverpool parallels against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League against Chelsea with a point at the 89th Saturday, in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while it was about 25 metres from the Chelsea gate, with its team below 1-0.
He touched the left ball before pulling on the second ball.
The attempt went high above the door frame as it turned toward the top right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell behind the back of Kepa Arrizabalaga by sucking into the net.
"I was just trying to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play ahead as much as possible, so I tried to create me as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante arrive and I gave a touch and I didn't think too much and I pulled."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the goal at the 25th minute marked by the star of Belgium Eden Hazard.
The Blue center went by touch to Mateo Kovacic before skiing near the middle of the field and kicking in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick move to the middle of the field.
So he took a beautiful walk that brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended up on the second floor with a left goal beyond Alsson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Naples in the round phase of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will have to face the Videoton at the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia arrived at 832, the agency responsible for managing the country's disasters declared Sunday morning.
A number of people were reported to be intertwined among the macesiers of the collapsed buildings following the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that hit the country on Friday and generated waves up to 6 meters high, reported the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been destroyed from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman is beaten to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in the morning with gun wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police invited people who could have seen or heard something in the area to contact.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning, but I would like to make an appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious and invited them to contact us.
I would also like to make an appeal to anyone, especially the taxi drivers, who might have recorded something on the Dashcam, so that you can contact us so that they can have very important information for our investigation."
A spokesperson for the police confirmed that the woman whose body was found is resident in Birkenhead and was found within a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived on the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location of the discovery this morning.
The investigations are under way and the police have said that they are currently informing the victims' families.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment but was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He remained speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents were informed that it would take hours before they were allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a scene of crime.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
Keep repeating "it's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the border area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were located within the limited area by checking the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about it is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111 indicating the registration 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "recording of history"
His expulsion would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his followers of Puritans.
But Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace became a goal.
The iconoclasty during British civil wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the story of a figure that many believe should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a Parliament's defender from external pressure, in his case obviously from the monarchy.
That is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the 17th century has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents part of this fracture.
His results as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
A Chinese farmer kills a pig killer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in South-West China in the news reported by local media.
The man, identified only with the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a resuscitated artery, covered with blood near a pig market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject pig vaccines in a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai in China.
It is reported that he had traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pighouse with blood on the mouse.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had removed the predator, standing in the statement.
"The legs of my cousin were covered with blood and maculated," said the cousin identified with the name "Wu", as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or the cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to avoid attacking other people, while the police collect evidence on the crime scene.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating a refund for the death of the kidnapper.
Although they are rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to man.
Ten years ago, a 300 kg pig caught a Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife managed to kick the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the flavor of blood can serve as "catalyst."
"They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious .... they don't want to do evil.
Just show them the right dose of respect," he explained.
The Straits of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy, extensive rains in the south-west of the USA
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and to the south-western coast of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane at 5 ET on Sunday and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it is forming a sawmill on the Pacific Ocean and moving east towards the western coast of the USA. While Rosa is approaching the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm, it will start pushing a strong tropical humidity toward the north, in the south-western part of the USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during the day of Monday.
Thus, tropical humidity in contact with the nearby drought will create heavy and wide precipitation in the south-west zone in the coming days.
At local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain may cause sudden floods, torrents of destruction and possible gaps in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour in some points, especially in the areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of 2.5-10 cm of rain is expected in some areas of the south-west, especially on most of Arizona.
There may be sudden flooding with conditions rapidly worsening due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly recommended to venture into the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
The strong rains could make the canyons of the rivers full and the timers will bring wind to the air and raise dust.
The nearby drought will cause strong local rains on part of the coast of southern California.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of waste and sliding loads.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona toward the end of Sunday and the beginning of Monday, before the rains become more extensive by the end of Monday and the beginning of Tuesday.
Heavy rains will come down on the Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong fluctuations of temperatures on the US as the Arctic cools down, but tropicals will remain warm enough.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature changes over short distances.
An exceptional example of sensitive temperature differences in Central America will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to increase and expand again.
A warm beginning of October is expected for a large part of the Central and Eastern USA, with 26 oC from the Southern Plains in the north-east areas.
In New York, you can reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, or about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate high temperature rates above the average for the Eastern USA until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's audience
More than 20 million people have followed on Thursday on six television networks the upcoming deposition by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would happen in the '80s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with issuers interrupting regular programming for a Friday's last minute: an agreement by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of one week's charges.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Commission that it was 100% certain that Kavanaugh had beaten her as a miscarriage and tried to strip her of her during a party to the superiors.
Kavanaugh, during an inflamed deposit, claimed to be 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen followed the deposit on Friday.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that transmitted them, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty counting the viewers who follow the programs in the offices.
To put it all in perspective, this is a hearing similar to that for a football game or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, has guided all networks, with an average of 5.69 million spectators throughout the day, reported Nielsen.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement stating that he would have voted in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was taken back by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while he was being insulted by demonstrators while trying to take an elevator to a hearing by the Commission on Justice.
He stayed with his eyes down for several minutes while he was rebuked and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told "He has power while many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued the statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have had other things to say during the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters were broadcast live a few hours later when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh's appointment to the whole Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would have done so only with certainty that the FBI would have analysed the allegations against the candidate during the following week, as requested by the minority democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have voted to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticise his programs of leaving the European Union "political façade" with the future of Britain and reiterating national interest in an interview with the daily Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another side-to-side interview with the prime minister on the first page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers agreement for Brexit, claiming that a proposal that Britain and the EU must accept their respective duties is "absolutely ridiculous"
Wayde Sims murder: police arrest the suspect of the death of the player of the LSU Dyteon Simpson
The police arrested a suspect of the death of Wayde Sims firearms, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder, said Baton Rouge's police department.
The authorities have posted a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered their glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB TV station affiliated to CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said the suspect admitted that he accidentally shot Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, reported by the defense attorney.
The office of the legal doctor of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task-force for the fugitives of the Louisiana state police, the police science lab, the Southern University police and the area's citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU thanked the forces of the order of the area for their commitment and the search for justice."
Yes, he was 20 years old.
The 198 cm attacker grew in Baton Rouge, where also the father, Wayne, played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 matches.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said that the team is "confused" and "soccupied" for Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about at any time," Wade said.
Volcano ash dumps Mexico City
The ashes that emerges from the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity had increased in the crater and 183 gas and ashes emissions had been recorded in 24 hours.
The center was controlling the various diamonds and scissors.
Pictures on the social media have shown subtle levels of ash that bear the umbrellas of cars in Mexico City neighbourhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicals have seen an increase in the activity corresponding to the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) to the southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists in the wake of the independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesting pro-independence met with the police's anti-subsidy teams and thousands of people joined opposition demonstrations to recall the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on the secession.
A group of separatists masked by the anti-somamous police targeted the police with eggs and threw dust paints, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that usually trap tourists.
Further collisions took place during the day with policemen who used the manganese to contain the fight.
For several hours the independent groups who sang "We won't forget, we won't forgive" were confronted with the Unionist demonstrators who were shouting "Long Life in Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
The tension remained high in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the Government of Madrid but recognized by Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with a overwhelming majority for independence, although the flu was low, and the Catalans opposed the secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people reported injuries last year after the police tried to stop the referendum that was taking place at headquarters throughout the region with violent clashes.
The independent groups had camped on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said he had no hope of becoming an independent Catalan.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I have seen my parents crying joyfully for the opportunity to vote, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite having won a fundamental victory, although measured at the regional elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have made it difficult to maintain the momentum this year, with many of the most well-known leaders of the movement who are found to be a voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who registered with her phone the protest in support of the police, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians from the two factions.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison waiting for trial since the end of last year, announced that he will be running for the European Parliament's elections next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the involvement of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after spying a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years of age, were arrested after being repeatedly beaten up by a car against a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and to the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a bullet at a certain point.
Menga's attack marks the victory of Livingston at 1-0 against the Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga with Livingston has marked the victory
The already promoted Livingston has left the Rangers dumbfounded by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as director of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference while Gary Holt's team went to the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team therefore remains without a victory out of the house in the Premiership this season and will have to face next Sunday the first in Hearts rankings, from which they are separated by 8 points.
On Thursday the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues its series of victories in the division, remaining struck by six matches, with Coach Holt who still has to see a defeat since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against uninvited guests
Holt's team should have been in favour right before the goal, with their immediateness that caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson went down but dragged his action in front of the mirror of the door and Alan Lithgow could only walk out the door after being inserted to meet Craig Halkett's head blow from the other side of the door.
The guests agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could have put the visitors in trouble with square football.
And it was so that the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers gave a punishment dance and the Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to pass to Menga, who could sign from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the ball's possession but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable and Porter Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This scheme was maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos had engaged Kelly in a standstill.
Scott Pittman saw his goal shot stopped by the Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow's feet shot off another Lifeston game scheme.
The crossings took place in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two requests for rigour, after Halkett's contrast with Glenn Middleton's replacement and one by hand, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to overcome expectations along this exceptional path.
Their style of play and their collaborators have changed very little since their return to the maximum series, but it is necessary to give Holt a lot of credit for the way he has been able to spread the team since his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, headed by a masterly organized defense, while Menga put into trouble Connor Goldson and Joe Worall throughout the game.
However, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite the excellent performances in some times with Gerrard, in this case they went well below those standards.
The last step is missing - only once they have been able to penetrate the enemy area - and you can consider an alarm bell for the Rangers, which is half-class.
Erdogan received with opposite reactions to Colonia
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan, in order to distance relations between NATO allies.
They were confronted with issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Colonia for the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population group outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police have motivated the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have made their voice heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept it in the country.
The protests reflect the dissertation caused by a visitor considered a hero by some German Turks and called a deposit by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies against a car
A cyclist died in a fight with a car in London.
The incident occurred near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic street in Deptford, in the south-eastern part of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the hit.
The incident occurred months after another cyclist died, invested by a road pirate in Children Street, about a mile from where the incident happened on Saturday.
The metropolitan police said the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads and buses have been blocked, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six injured guards during a disorder
Six prison guards were injured during an disorder at the male prison for maximum security, reported the prison office.
The turbulence is broken at the maximum safety male prison of Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST about Sunday and is still underway.
Specialized "Tornado" agents have been used to manage the riot, which involves eight prisoners and is confined to a prison wing.
Agents were treated on the spot for slight facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: "The specially formed personal prison was prepared to contain an incident currently under way at Long Lartin's prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons, and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer prison sentence."
Long Lartin is housed in more than 500 prisons, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital care following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-sombosis agents were called to intervene in prison to realize a violent mob during which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
The Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which could benefit areas affected by drought)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but it is precisely what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the south-west of the desert, creating sudden flooding risks.
The national weather service has already issued alerts of sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, South-West California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rain.
Phoenix's national weather service has reported on a tweet that only "ten tropical cycles have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre include precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with small isolated up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the South-West area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin will receive from 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with small isolated up to 10 cm.
For foreign areas at the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these precipitations will probably be positive because the South-West zone is currently going through a drought period.
In view of the drought monitoring centre, little more than 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
Initially, the path of Hurricane Rosa will be able to stand on the ground through the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, who was still holding the hurricane force Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles an hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is moving north to 12 miles an hour.
The storm will meet with the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that he will arrive in Mexico with a tropical storm force in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
Precipitation on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"There are precipitations between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-west zone of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with tropical depression, then heading through Arizona and to the South Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or her scars are intense precipitation in Baja California, the north-west zone of Sonora and the south-west desert area of the USA," the National Hurricane Centre reported.
These rains are expected to generate sudden, potentially fatal floods and torrents of destruction in the deserts, as well as free on mountain terrain.
Midsomer Norton's assault: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a sedentary was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST about Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital where he remained in "stable" conditions.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, reported Avon and Somerset police.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who could have picked up what happened with the phone.
Trump states that Kavanaugh "has suffered for the wickedness and wrath" of the democratic party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the insults and insults of the democratic party," Trump said during a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered for evil and wrath" of the democratic party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh filed a motion before Congress Thursday, denying in a passionate way Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual violence against her decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also filed a hearing defending the charge.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people were able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced law minds of our time, a lawyer with uncountable precedents in the public service," he said in front of the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment by referring to the importance of republican influenza in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I really do," he said.
"For this lot strictly for exceptional candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are committed to "resistance and obstruction."
The first substantive procedural vote to the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, as the CNN said a senior assistant to the GOP.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami, and the numbers of victims continue to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many of the giant waves that have been swept away on the beaches, when an earthquake of great magnitude and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when the waves rose up to 6 meters (18 feet) they fell on the beach at the crepusculo, scattering many people by killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the threat of tsunamis appeared yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and were not running away immediately, turning into victims," Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian agency for the control of BNPB disasters, said.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it dragged with itself cars, trunks, houses, it hit anything on the terrain," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people are climbing trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency have shown numerous buildings and shops destroyed, fenced and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The escorts continued to scuttle the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was perceived in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a communication that the energy released by the heavy earthquake of Friday was almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensions" and claimed that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels are collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the masonry of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were scattered.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "are totally paralyzed, with no information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
"This and already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday because it had not reported that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities had said that waves had arrived at the time the alarm was launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, one feels a man on a top floor of a building that cries out in a nervous way to warn the people on the way down.
A few minutes after a water wall fell on the beach, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that interrupted the communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate relief operations.
According to the authorities, the army has begun to send cargo with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the fugitives still need food and other first-needed goods.
The airport of the city has been reopened only for relief and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The budget for tsunami victims in Indonesia amounts to over 800.
It's terrible.
Although the World Vision staff of Dongala was able to reach sound and save the city of Palu, where the employees took refuge under roof coverings in the courtyard of their office, during the trip they encountered a scene of devastation, Doseb said.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even though the aid groups have begun the difficult start-up operations of the aid facilities, there have been some complaints about the fact that foreign aid operators with extensive knowledge have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
The Indonesian legislation states that funding, supplies and staff from abroad may begin to arrive only if the site of a disaster has been declared to be a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami, friends and family of the dispersed still maintained the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a child was extracted from a leak.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had remained locked under the mattress for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the preparer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the scattered paragliding pilots.
Other people involved in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandadi, were its students.
"As they vete in the paragliding sector, I am carrying my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in hours after the news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the umbrella community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, stopped at a single sign of gray spike instead of two blue signs.
"I think you mean the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a resupply of ATM at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying a ATM at Newport on the Levee, a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a ATM in the center of entertainment and preparing to deliver another money, said researcher Dennis McCarthy in the Communication.
While he was busy, another man "was kicked behind Brink's employee" and stole a purse with the money for delivery.
Some witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, standing in the news, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the crime.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes its name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When announcing Saturday the change of name on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has been renamed Ye for a long time and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change took place before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
The program replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotive reasons", said the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'" said West at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with the radio player Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We have passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye - the reflection of our goodness, of our misery, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are."
It's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has also changed the name with or without indent and letters.
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody kidnapping against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when student movements on the left were taking place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by expanding their monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double the financing for the IA
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the funds dedicated to research in this field, says the investor and operator of IA Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of various U.S. government groups regarding the IA, although in the U.S. there is generally no formal IA strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its programme last year: it aims to be the country No. 1 in innovation IA by 2030.
"Redoubleding the budget in the search for the IA would be a good start because all the other countries are far behind the United States and we need a new revolution in the IA," Lee said.
The duplication of funding could double the chances that next great success in the IA sector will be achieved in the USA, Lee said to the CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt editorial house, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the main companies of IA in China, Face++.
In the '80s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an IA system that beat Otello's American player with the highest score and was later led by Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google section.
Lee recalled the previous U.S. government technological contests such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when you will have the next one to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get money from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking out academic leaders, they're multinationals," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have taken up lighting from universities to work on IA projects.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could help the US to boost its efforts in the field of IA.
"I think the green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in IA," he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to those who work in academic institutions, in a way similar to that of the National Foundation for Science and other governmental organizations distributing funds to US researchers, poor academic quality is lower in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve industrial partners and universities and the White House has announced the formation of a special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called the Next AI.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in IA research.
In the meantime, the U.S. order to create a National Commission for Safety on Artificial Intelligence has not registered activities for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum for the change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change in the country's name in the "North Macedonia Republic of Macedonia", a move that would resolve the long-standing dispute with Greece that blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbours constitutes a claim on its territory and has put the vote at Macedonia's entry to NATO and the EU.
The two governments have reached agreement in June on the basis of the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycotting campaign raised doubts about the possibility that the flu would reach at least 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "It agrees with NATO and EU accession and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to be paid so that Macedonia can be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have stated that they will respect the result of the vote to make it final.
The change of name would require a majority of two thirds in paralysis.
The State Electoral Commission has stated that there have been no reports of irregularity until 13:00.
However, the flu was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters expressed their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a capital elector, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the Macedonia referendum to change the name of the country that would open the door to NATO and the European Union accession to Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parment in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small stage and setting the chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get in high, not for the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can address others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO accession will bring much needed investment in Macedonia, which represents a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would have participated in the referendum - a percentage below the level of inflation required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia indicated that 57% of the interviewees planned to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said that they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the fluency must be 50% more than one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the West-West government since it was established in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero del Manchester City marks a goal by avoiding the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took part in Brighton's defense during the match won by Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero has made it extremely easy for his point marked at the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a midfield transition at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting on the free field.
Aguero was thus found surrounded by four green spells.
He humiliated one defender before overcoming others at the border of Brighton.
So he made a left-hand move, where he found Sterling.
The British attacker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat the porter of Brighton Mathew Ryan with a right shot in the net.
"Aguero is having problems at the foot," the city coach, Pep Guardiola, told reporters.
"We talked about making him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he was able to sign at that time."
But it was Sterling who initially took advantage of the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal has arrived at 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep on the Brighton field.
He sent a beautiful filter ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
Sky Blues attacker pulled the ball off the net just before he left the field.
The City will fight the Hoffenheim in the Championships League round at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim in Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which maintain an advantage of a game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least a match with a victory of 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday evening, but they still hope to get their title in the first division.
"Even if we play without a goal, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
And why shouldn't I ever want to drive?"
The Nationals still have to announce a first launcher on Sunday, but it is said that they are inclined to let Scherzer be launched in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, held a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher in his normal rest Sunday.
Washington launcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Trump a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the influence of Republicans during the midterm elections.
"All we've done is put into practice in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really giving up on this, I'm fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "We see this horrible group of radical democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary, you can see the misery, the misery.
They don't care who can hit, who must bother to regain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control and we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of "resistance and obstruction."
"And it's been possible to see him in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "rageful, bad, mean and lying."
He referred to the Senate Justice Commission with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, firing strong figures among the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you slip the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, um, I expect a - that was a bad language of the body - the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
He won't tolerate people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it was not a big surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of members of the Labour Parliament to whom it was said not to be welcome, and everyone because they said what they thought.
My colleague, Mr Ryan, has received similar treatment because he has firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically all issues similar to those about which Jeremy was in conflict with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday evening meetings have been exactly that way.
Today, however, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and polite" policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has never been remembered.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable or not for party leadership.
All this began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, and colleagues with whom I previously thought to share a similar political vision began to expect an investment on my part and that I would take positions that I would never accept, whether it was national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - they follow up on insults on the social media asking for my resignation, denouncing the policy of the centre and telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I am sure to be happier than other colleagues because the comments to me tend to be political.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a torrent of sexual or racist abuses every day but who are not intimidated.
One of the most deplorable aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of insult.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every move of trust or modification of the selection rules, the party is restricted.
In the last two years, I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower my head, not to express so openly my opinions and everything "would be fine".
But it's not about doing this that I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, caused by the concern of the Thatcher government that had left my high school class literally to fall apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need them more, as local councillor or government minister.
I have never concealed my political opinions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could remain in any way distracted by my political positions and by the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will damage the family cores, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy by talking about my loyalty to the head of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my electors, who are members of the Labour Party or less: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of those I consider to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an Ayr hit scale
Two late attempts might have somehow imbalanced the final result, but there is no doubt that Air has earned the triumph in this exceptionally fun game of Tennent's Day Championship.
I'm now at the top of the class, the only team hit on ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their courage, that pushed the home team and Coach Peter Murchied had all the reasons for being satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we are still beaten, so I must be happy," the coach said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We must recognize the merit of Ayr, they have made better use of our opportunities."
Grant Anderson's goal at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Air in favour, but a yellow cartel for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, sparkled by Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot caught an unconverted goal.
Climate has increased the distance of the Air with a rigor before, exactly in half time, to sign and then to convert a goal from just to bring the Air to 17-5 at the interval.
But Melrose well started the second time and the goal of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, which has been extended, and at the beginning, the Air is once again scored in favour thanks to a goal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climate.
The Deputy Captain of the Air Blair Macpherson received a yellow cartel and Melrose paid the man in addition with an unconverted goal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow cartridge for a contrast with Climo without ball, from the rigor touch, MacPherson signaled a touch down behind the moving air mixture.
The climate has changed, as it had done almost since the beginning, after Rowe had collected the football from David Armstrong's area and sent Flanker Gregor Henry to search for the fifth goal of the home team.
Star of Still Game looking for a new career in the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel sector after discovering that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor covers Jack Jarvis's role in the popular BBC show, which writes and interprets together with the long-standing partner Greg Hemphil.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the final show and it seems Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
On the list of official reports, he is the Director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to issue statements, although a source of the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant trade."
'"The sea is ours": Bolivia without a break on the sea hopes that a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a general marine neighborhood covered with sariame in La Paz.
Public buildings launch a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right.
It's a duty to recover it."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the lost coast and now in Chile after a bloody conflict on the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to swallow the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may have reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the spear, a spirit of unity and serenity and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the International Court of Justice's judgment on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Aia court welcomes Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent dialogue, Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia a break in the state's jurisdiction.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year - has a lot of dancing with Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favour of Bolivia and that it would not change much if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate the Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice arrived just six months after the final proceedings indicates that the case ‘was not complicated’, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And long to advance the Bolivian cause, the past four years could have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale's belligerent rhetoric has fallen into any good intentions of Chile, he has suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to some extent the negotiations, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions as soon as possible.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia to the Aia, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process would be particularly accelerated.
On Monday, Bolivia will be able "to enjoy extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end up 139 years of conflicts with mutual advantage", he explained.
Calzadilla has also denied he Morales - one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - is using the maritime issue as political escamotage.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen without confidence in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong I have said that his nation will never carry out nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington first.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to have faith in the promises made at the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments arrive at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be intending to resume diplomatic talks in standby after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
It explains that it is an "ilusion" that the continuation of US sanctions and opposition to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never put North Korea on its knees.
Washington differs from issuing the statement without first making important disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's intention to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows present the latest trend in huge ceilings that will soon be in a high fashion shop near you
If you want to expand your collection of blankets or completely block the rays of the sun, do not search any more.
Valentine's and Thom Browne's stylists have revealed a series of crazy oversize covers for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely little practical hats have angered Instagram this summer and these stylists have sent their exciting creations on the passageway.
The main part of Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide edge similar to lead that has submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversize accessories included antlers, a witch hat and even an pineapple - but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks have cut lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than at high heels.
One creation resembled a complete dive with masks and glasses, while another looked like a dissolved ice cone.
And if you continue with the enormous statements of style, you're lucky.
The style observers predict that the huge bulwarks could reach you in the streets of the high fashion.
The outsize hats arrive on the scene of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a wide stretch of more than one meter that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very little practical hat that invaded the social media has sent another huge creation in the passageway: a large beach bag in straw almost as much as the model in suit as it carries.
The roasted orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and with a white leather handle was the strong piece of the Spring-Summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Stylist of the famous Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect these big hats and beach bags to arrive in luxury stores next summer, because the stylist has got such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this is continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results at the exams, strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further higher education, their chosen career and their place in the world as global citizens.
As a field of education capable of developing and adopting a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular subject and demand within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak him in his mother tongue, the message will reach the heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to create trust relations with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are above the graduates, with the highest rates of success within independent schools.
68% of students who have studied foreign languages have obtained the maximum number of votes.
The data, collected from the 74 schools members of the SCIS, showed that 72% of the students received the highest vote with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish received the highest vote.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as basic skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a matter choice, are considered at the same level of STEM materials (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons for the difficulty of covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more opportunities for work requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a life skills like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to competition.
In a survey of YouTube among over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% was unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to maintain a conversation and the French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is so important for today's children.
The knowledge of more languages, in particular those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Various schools will focus on the more traditional modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with the specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the necessary skills for success, whatever their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the pre-compiled opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be set for how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell has tweeted that James will probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After the week-on-week training, James was asked what his plans were for the programme of six pre-compiled Lakers games.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly games to prepare me," he said.
The moment of meeting a West Virginia Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from the start tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia, at a meeting.
This is the first meeting of the five planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation suspended for his choice to cover the vacant place at the Supreme Court, Trump will try to create support for the next midterm elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress in November.
To what time will Trump's start and how is it possible to follow him online?
The beginning of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow the beginning of Trump in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who have become thesis due to allegations of sexual violence with a Senate's early confirmation vote suspended for one week while the FBI is conducting investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of beginnings is to help the Republicans who have to face the November elections to get a little push.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that these five meetings over the next week are intended to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority held by the Senate and the House of Deputies," standing in Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to its programme that the president will travel as many states as possible as we go through the most busy season of the campaign," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Programed for the Wesbank Arena of Wheeling, the beginning of tonight could appeal to supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the coverage of the Pittsburgh media," standing at West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate to the Republican Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in line in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to try to push him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, standing in Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team demonstrates the courage to fight to keep hope alive until Sunday's singles
After three unique sessions, Saturday afternoons could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The bike of the oscillating pendulum is a completely invented sports concept in which players firmly believe and never like in competitions like these.
So where would the bike be now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I'd say we're keeping a little bike," Jordan Spieth said while he was away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, in favour of four points ahead with 12 others at stake.
The Americans feel a bit of wind in favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to hope for, not from the last shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each one boasts three points over four.
Spieth was sprayed from tea to green and he's giving the example.
The festive gouts became stronger as the game continued, sinking a crucial kitt to match the counts at the game four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His dick that made them win the 15-hole match was welcomed with a similar hurdle, which tells you that he thinks the American team is not out of the race yet.
"You really have to put it all up to worry about your game," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with several points of Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable version of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple in Europe is four to four and cannot do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to pull a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning's ninth hole.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow from and towards the hot crowd reinforces the certainty that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there would not be a more popular player of Fleetwood or Molinari to suggest a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both on different mouths at the same time.
However, European speeches of glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it very soon to reach Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was together with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes have melted the Spanish and Swedish into a hole from which they have not even been able to climb far.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you get out of your mouth.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to observe from a distance through interactions between couples, advice that they give and that they don't give and how the strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage in the final day, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with an advantage of 10-6 in the final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage in the final day of Ryder Cup after finishing the fourball games and Saturday fairs with an advantage of 10-6 on the United States.
The inspired couple made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the task with two victories on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score to Le Golf National at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in an attempt to preserve the lost trophy in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning's fourballs, winning 3-1.
The U.S. has resisted more in the fursomes, winning two matches, but they have not been able to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from the 12 single Sunday games to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European highlight to win four points of row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After sketching Woods and Patrick Reed at the fourballs, they worked in a great way to beat down Woods and the American Bryson Dechambeau with an even cleaner 5+4.
Woods, who withdrew for two Saturday matches, showed occasional gifts of genius but lost 19 of its 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven rows.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning's fourballs, returned to the side of partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to beat 2+1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world's rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the results expected in a pleasant and ventilated day in south-west Paris.
The three great winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas fixed the reference for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a grand victory 2+1 on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and then came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes, losing both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team has returned from a four-point gap passing to the individual, although as a holder, Furyk's team only needs a pair to defend the trophy.
After being the best second for two days, however, a Sunday contract seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea absolutely rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions was undermining the country's trust in the United States, that in such circumstances it would absolutely refuse to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said on the occasion of the General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea has adopted "significant measures of good will" during the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, demobilising the nuclear testing site and the commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any consistent response from the USA," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no security in our national security and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri has re-used the notes of regret concerning Washington's resistance to "in phase" denuclearization with which North Korea would be awarded on the basis of step-by-step actions, its declaration was important because it has not completely rejected unilateral denuclearization as already done by Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US president in charge and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim undertook to work towards the "declaration of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees to North Korean security.
North Korea has sought a formal end-to-end agreement with the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also objected to appeals to encourage the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States insists on the need to "have a denuclearisation first" and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive manner and even oppose the "declaration of the end of the war", said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can put us on the knees is an illusion of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our trust."
Ri did not refer to programmes of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had announced to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last 5 months and added: "If the counterpart of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead."
But also, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from that of last year's UN General Assembly, when he said that it was inevitable to aim at the US territory with North Korea's missiles after "the president of evil" Trump called Kim a "mission man" engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations Trump, which had threatened to "completely destroy North Korea" last year, he praised Kim for his courage in taking the path of disarmament, but declared that the sanctions would still have to be done much and that the sanctions would remain in force until North Korea was denuclearized.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a deadline, asserting that "if you want two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Respect for the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without exceptions until complete, final and final disclosure is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported North Korea's sanctions in 2006 in an attempt to undermine the funding of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
It was distributed by Pyongyang in July, claiming that progress had been made, but a few hours after North Korea accused him of having submitted "a request from a gangster."
North Korea had committed itself during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States had adopted "conformity measures."
He stated that Kim had explained to him that the "conformity measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had undertaken in Singapore and actions towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has forced all its students to sleep more in an attempt to contrast the growing male culture to study for whole nights fed by caffeine.
One university student found that university students number one in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he considers to be the first of this kind in the United States.
He had the idea of starting the course after a conference that he had given on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At last a girl came by me and said to me, 'Why is this just told me now, when I'm last year?'
He said that no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much," he told The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to the students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performances as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course of one hour provides for a series of interactive activities.
In a section there is the picture of a bedroom, where students can select cups of coffee, tents, gym shoes and books to get to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are influenced by the lack of sleep, and the importance of a evening routine.
In another section, participants are told how the long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the effects on the health of the choice to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride linked to the "white night to study" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students bring the lack of sleep to be a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, poverty, anxiety, explained and should even serve to avoid getting fat as the lack of sleep brings the brain in an inedia mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the Faculty of Chemical and Physical Biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop the course, after following one of his lessons last year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course directed at the entire campus.
The next step, hopefully, will be to ask all graduates to follow a similar study programme before joining this competitive institution.
Prof. Cheisler advised students to set up a wake for when they should go to bed, as well as for when they should wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can send in tilt the circaday rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to beat Gerrard's men
The Rangers have suffered another attack of depression from outside the house with the goal of Dolly Menga that was relieving Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking for the first victory outside the house from the 4-1th of February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team attacked Gerrad's second defeat in 18 coach matches leaving his team at eight points from the running leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspired Ranger formation never seemed to be able to balance.
As the Ranger goes down to the sixth place, the Livingston goes up to the third, and only behind the Hibernian because of the goal difference.
And there might be further problems coming for the Rangers after the Calum Spence guard has been cured for a head injury due to an object apparently launched from the outside of the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly exceeded Air in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual training that broke a point at Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team had suffocated its opponents on every turn.
Rangers may have dominated by the possession of a ball, but Livingston has made better use of the balls at his disposal.
They could have signaled just after two minutes when Menga's filtering passage in the first time sent Scott Pittman to the door of Allan McGregor, but the middle camper missed the opportunity.
A punishment football in depth by Keaghan Jacobs therefore found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense companion Alan Lithgow could only pull on the other side.
Rangers took control but it seemed to be more hope than convincing in their game in the rigor area.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought it necessary to see a strict end to the 15th as a result of a conflict with Steven Lawless, but the arbitrator Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian demands.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice into the door in the first time, but the former porter of the Ibrox Liam Kelly didn't let himself be concerned about the blow of Lassana Coulibaly and a soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the Livingston opening goal at the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it only because of his commitment.
Once again the Rangers failed to manage a deeply placed football in Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball into Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact because the wing had blown a ball in Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself off the door line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors exactly into the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long ball after the other.
Holt's team might have increased the distance in the final stages, but McGregor objected to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton submitted a last request of rigor after a crossing with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almacco: the inventor of Geiger counter
And now a page from our luncheon "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTEGGIO continues... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as Geiger counter.
A solid point of science since then, the counter Geiger has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," interpreted by those unbelievable scientists cowboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones you can really hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say a little bit about it right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days since his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the bad cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells by a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
So they can "see" a common protein with many types of tumors and then they are rejuvenated
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells by a patient and their laboratory alteration so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancer types, called HER2, and therefore these cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "promots the growth of different types of tumors", including that in the breast, the ovaries, the lungs and the right-wing colon, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure for the extraction of immune cells from patients to "teach" them like to hit the tumor cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West launches in a pro-Trump diatrib wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) after its appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was caught up in the study during a Saturday Night Live score after a final performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would be candidate in 2020.
After interpreting his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a mahout, started a fight against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so many times and they say to me, "How you like Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have gone away from America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL started the show with a scene whose protagonist was Matt Damon, in which Hollywood's star surrounded Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Commission on Justice against the allegations of sexual violence presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been transmitted, the registration of the Philip of West has been charged on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock himself is trying to get around West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public about having spent a bad time in the backstage due to its cover.
"I got busted in the backstage.
They said to me, ‘Don’t go out with that cry.’
I've been busted!
And so they told me I'm a cripple," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and said "I'd wear Superman's coat because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments have generated fish at least twice from the public and the members of the SNL cast seem embarrassed, he said Variety, with a person who told the newspaper: "A mortal silence has been silenced on the study."
West was invited to replace the last minute of the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West concerted many with a performance of the song I Love It, wrapped in Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the leader of the group of TPUSA Conservatives, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for having kept a test on MASSA."
But show director Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "what it is and that's just wonderful."
"But I have chosen NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") who I think is embracing a voracious ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
And that's how we are," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
It's not about the first artist to change his name and he's following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The friend rapper, Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the lost musical legend Prince, who had changed his name into a symbol and thus in the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for reception at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was killed at a restaurant in Belfast east on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused will have to report to Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Office of the Public Ministry.
The Star of the Spade Kit Harington Throne attacks the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as fighter Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series medieval Throne of Sword.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that such on-screen soils often make kids believe that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that "something has gone wrong" and reflected on how to manage the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married to the co-star of the Spade Throne, 31 years old, has allowed himself to worry a lot about this problem.
'I am personally concerned, very at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grow up in terms of the problem we are now observing?'
Kit believes that television could partly be responsible for the increase in male toxicity due to its extremely male characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, which makes kids think they have to be in this particular way of being human?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for young people.'
In the course of the interview, he also admitted that he will not interpret any prequille or sequel of the Spade Throne once the series is finished next summer, claiming that he "has ended with battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will play the main role in the Revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the history of a cinematographic producer and his brother, who is a rapist.
The actor recently revealed that he considered the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with the Sword Throne.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me my future family, and my life from now on," she explained.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, the character of Kit, in the fantasy series that won Emmy.
The couple got married in June 2018 in the holding of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported already in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has been spread in the past as a result of infectious blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has declined to almost zero, according to the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
The transmission of HIV by sex is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protection during sexual relations within such relations.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the staff has hacked the data of the GOP senators, and speaks of "dangerous lies" and "spiration theories".
On Saturday, the U.S. Member filed charges against a member of his staff concerning the publication of personal information by three U.S. republican senators on the legislation's Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic Member of Los Angeles has said that the statements were promoted by opinionists and websites of the ' ultra-right wing'.
"Budgets, lies and still vengeful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information would include home address and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, issued by an anonymous Campidoglio during a hearing of a commission of experts on allegations of sexual violence against the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The news leak took place after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the post source was associated with the Waters office and released information about a member of the Waters staff.
"This inflexible charge is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been returned as a result of these false and trendy accusations, has not been in any way responsible for the escape of such information.
This inflexible charge is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly generated online reviews from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This lie is furious," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't get angry.
It must not be provocative.
He must not question the accused's reasons.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by the detractors of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in the race to overthrow Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great if confirmed," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned "the competent authorities and the forces of the order of these trendy statements.
"Let's make those responsible get exposed," he continued, "and that they must respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all my staff members."
Review by Johnny English yet again - the parody of the spy with a Rowan Atkinson undersized
He became used to looking for references to Brexit in every new movie with a British touch and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's comedy, started in 2003 and relived in 2011 with Johnny English - The Renaissance.
Will the veiled autoronia on the subject of how evil we are doing be the new opportunity for the nation's export?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the rubber face and the eyes out of the orbits has obtained his license to casino things for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that is a comic creation developed for non-anglophone cinema fruit countries.
Of course it is the shocking secret agent that despite his strange claims of glamorous has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pizza of that kind that contributed with a single note to the theme of Gloria's opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
This is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveler and man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard, who left the chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this last release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English who came close to the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the elites flew briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems quite undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that brands of "series" like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comics as an ingredient.
The humour seems direct to children rather than adults and for me the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not as original and focused as Atkinson's dumb movies when he plays Mr. Bean.
Immutable today is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker has been infiltrated into the British spy supersecret web network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, with the agent in charge, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vessel stumble for a supposed and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a plot of political impotentism: Emma Thompson does his best with this character like-Teresa May but there is not much to work on in the copy.
Her intelligence consultants inform her that every single active spy has been compromised and that she will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this means that the poor Johnny English, who now works as a school leader in a chic establishment, but who also provides formal lessons about how to be a undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gag, when English offers a school of rock spying course.
English is released to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former suffering partner Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a girl's role in the high society in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of Disasters for the Secret Services of His Majesty are again in action, to meet the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously into the network of the charismatic billionaire of technology that claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the left-wing Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hate of ridiculous adventures: transformed by cameramen, they light up in a French restaurant; they launch the hell by secretly entering on the luxury yacht of Volta and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a mask of virtual reality to take credit for the home of Volta.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but as far as garb and exuberant, there is a lot of TV for children throughout the story.
It's all pretty modest.
And how did it happen with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: the British film industry couldn't assign Rowan Atkinson a role that makes his talent right?
The Labour Party refuses to be preparing a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical programme that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, although paid for five.
The party would like the company's principals to transfer the savings obtained by the artificial intelligence (IA) revolution to the workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
In this way employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, keeping the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and with the plans to bend the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day day was brought down by the union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A review of the political line is expected by the end of the year."
"It will not be one day to another, but a four-day working week is an in-line aspirations with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as with its industrial strategy as a whole."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week in the framework of the 2017 general election campaign.
In any case, this aspirations do not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is currently not the subject of discussion."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the Labourist Conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless leaders" and "speculators" in public services companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also imply that the current shareholders of the water distribution companies might not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour Government could implement the "deductions" on the basis of conduct considered unlawful.
It also confirmed the plans to include employees in the business management councils and to create inclusive participation funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net equity of private sector enterprises to employees, which end up in the pocket of annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has referred the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question whether the findings of the government agency may influence or at least some of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that will take place on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it is possible for the FBI to bring them into the light something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said it while I was in the audience, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, who came out of that charge, I said, 'Did you do it?'
It was resolved, determined, unmistakable."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be carved into the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could resist a bomb-proof charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever she named couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything in change again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that sees the exhibition of a remarkable carriage of stars and has an equally imaginable mission: to end poverty in the world.
At the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people turning to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performance such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event, the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public of the concert had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a call or any other significant way that would help raise awareness about their purpose of eradicating poverty.
But exactly what happened at the Global Citizen Festival now that they are 12 years old to reach the intended goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a genuine way to persuade people to apply for action, or is it just another example of so-called "clickivism"- people who feel that they really make the difference simply by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which have been operated for a number of different purposes.
It states that these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to announce commitments and policies of more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the early years of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or used as funds.
The group estimates that so far protected capital funds have had a direct impact on around 649 million people in the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives based in the United Kingdom, committed to "helping children grow as much as possible", with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history," said The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions have been implemented calling on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the extension of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, who asked: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard path - sometimes we will fail and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of those who will show up at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement "a block" and hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington can, "if necessary", use its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, has revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke has confirmed that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern pillar of Europe," she said.
And according to officials, there are means and ways to confront you.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval block, in order to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the agreements at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that self-defines the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to make a financial contribution and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "a little versatile", with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The declarations were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to strengthen the export of its natural liquid gas in Europe, and to replace Russia, the option that European consumers are at all cost.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including the same President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2, a project of "inappropriate" pipeline which, according to Trump, has made Berlin "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the North Stream 2, a $11 billion gas pipeline, designed to double the capacity of the existing up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economical project.
The Cremlin object that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is guided simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the option of choosing suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a September meeting in Moscow with Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy of the United States.
The position of the United States has sparked the negative reaction of Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Industry Organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the United States to stay out of European Union energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see as a big problem the fact that a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take "in serious consideration" to run for the presidency in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would take "serious consideration" to run for president following the mid-term elections.
During a city assembly in Holyoke, in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could see the possibility of running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and put our poor government in place, and this implies having a woman at the top," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously my candidacy as President."
During the city assembly, Warren said about President Donald Trump, saying he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court.
On Friday Warren wrote in a tweet: "it's natural that we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren’s own electors do not believe that they should run in 2020.
58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not compete, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
32% supported such an application.
The poll has achieved greater support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in support of a potential candidacy and 48 percent in return.
Other names of high profile democrats discussed on a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would take an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after being rowed in September
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"What is happening to my son, what is happening after he has returned, I can put it in relation to other families who experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorders and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning with," said the public at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they return a little different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for which their soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have dedicated themselves to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic aggression and violence against a woman, which interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of firearms under drugs, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Police Department of Wasilla.
18 States and the District of Colombia support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen States and the District of Colombia support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to refugees from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and the District of Colombia presented a memory of friends curiae in Washington on Friday to support an asylum-seeker contestant, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Sessions' call that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and her violent children members of the gang" abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
She was put in a standstill in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, such as nations that face major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy was endorsed by the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014 which made it possible to apply for asylum to immigrants without documents from domestic violence.
On Friday, the District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, said that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of each and particular circumstances of the request, and such a prohibition violates that principle," says the memory of amicius curiae.
In the memory, prosecutors also objected that the policy banning the entry of immigrants damages the US economy, affirming the net probability of these becoming entrepreneurs and "provides the necessary manpower".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges not to guarantee asylum for victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence.
"The asylum is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecutions or fears due to race, religion, nationality, belonging to certain social groups or for political opinion," Sessions said on 11 June, as part of the announcement of the political line.
Asylum has never been designed to alleviate every problem -- even all serious problems -- that people have to deal with every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover from Palu while the death budget doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said the 35n mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her little feverish child in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"At every moment there's an ambulance that carries bodies.
The clean water is scaring."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, wandering among their fragile personal effects, in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were devastated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, were victims of a fracture at the back and back, resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated abroad because of the continuous strong cracks of assistance.
His eyes filled with tears as he recounted the feeling of the violent earthquake that shook the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I've been crushed between the walls, I think," Haris said to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a marriage.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "prepoting" with "advertising"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement on a U.S. newspaper, publishing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to advertise.
United States Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the newspaper with the highest sales in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congress elections of 6 November, an accusation that China rejects.
The accusation from Trump, regarding the fact that Beijing was trying to get involved in the US elections, noted what US officials referred to Reuters as a new phase of a escalation campaign in Washington's work to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a trade war in escalation that has seen them adapt their duties to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's takeover duties had been designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and US experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and previously long-term governor of Iowa, great exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register Sunday, "now it increases those prepositions by publishing advertising on our free newspapers."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing a payment advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the editorial on the road here in Beijing you will find few dissident voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese population might have on China's problematic economic path, as the media are under the firm hold of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most daily signs has eluded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what the newspaper was about.
The Republicans are alienating the female electorate before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
Since many republics at the top defend Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court and are on their side in the face of various charges for sexual harassment, analysts have reported that there will be a negative reaction, especially by women, during the future half-sent elections.
The agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to proceed with a vote.
"You can't withdraw these things," he told The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said to doubt that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison)'s last minute's insistence on an FBI investigation would be sufficient to please the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow or November," she said on Friday, according to Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman of the Progressive Group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate Chamber, when Republicans who control the Judicial Commission chose to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats are going to the stars," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, said to the news site.
"People say they were already tall; it's true.
But they could be higher, especially among the undecided periphery electricians and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote even though they do not thank the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had assumed that a negative reaction could have been made if the Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
"For the GOP it became a confused set," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republic, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote for the committee, about the final one, or if Kavanaugh is going to be put in a bench, it's also about how the Republicans managed the situation and how they dealt with it," he said to the news channel Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect the Democrats.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to whom to believe following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favour of the latter.
A new YouTube survey shows that 41 percent of the interviewees have probably or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to have certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent said to believe that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one of the other defendants, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath, before the Senate Judicial Committee, that Kavanaugh had assaulted him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposes his genitals during a party during the Yale studies in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to re-evaluate with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest design of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that brings its origins from the open source solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked at the fact that the intention of hiding behind Inrupt is "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," said the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data store" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, things to do, calendars, musical libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data store is that it is completely optional for the user who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal enhancement through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, company CEO, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff involved to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, technology programmers around the world will be able to bring their decentralised apps to life using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team won't tell "Facebook and Google if you introduce or not a complete change where their business models are completely erased from one day to another.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium released Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to seek commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
After the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only ecclesiastical of the Church of England to be awarded a Victoria Cross during the First World War by combatant was commemorated in its hometown after 100 years.
The Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, obtained recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a check and he never knew that he had achieved the highest level of British military honour.
On Saturday at a stand in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren opened a memorial lastra.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone would have been inaugurated exactly 100 years from the award-winning product of his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion beyond the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thin fog, under the heavy fire of the camp and war machines".
Then he rushed towards the fire line and with the "largest galanteria", he made the line move before he had run with a single-handed cannon and landed three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German checkman on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never be to height and something that makes him more humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt really honored to cover a role in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he will receive from many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night looking at Bellator 206, and instead they caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've been up all night looking at the famous Bellator 206 just to see you denied the vision of the main event.
The San Jose program included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and had to be broadcast in the United Kingdom during the night, directly on Channel 5.
At 6:00 in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were stuck when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some stayed based after being awake until the early hours of the morning especially for fighting.
On Twitter a fan described the transition to children's cartoon as "a kind of bad taste joke".
"The government's regulation provides that at six in the morning the content was no longer appropriate, so it was necessary to switch to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked for transmission.
"Puppa the pig," "yes."
"The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think that when I think about the playback, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But there are six in the morning of Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for them.
But we're working.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages came and nobody was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we do normally - and we have tried to get so much for the fans, and we have just discussed it.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" because of sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his own sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he came to high school, because "they're not all like me."
Speaking at the first point of Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said that she had made her voice hear about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that being a parent made him less important to win the Olympics.
The usual presentation of the old date program, Kirsty Young, took a number of free months for illness.
Presenting himself as a marginalist in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he had heard "less than" anyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable that he liked both the boys and the girls".
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and of feeling different, were things that really gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to try to be "something," he said, so that no one would be disappointed if they had discovered his sexuality by chance.
The two times bronze medal at the Olympics has become a high profile LGBT activist and has used his face in the Australian Commonwealth Games this year to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had made his voice hear because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three times world champion said that the fact that he was in love with a man - US director Dustin Lance Black, who knew in 2013 - "I was surprised".
Daley married Oscar's winner, who was 20 years older than he was last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When I was so young" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar high and low.
Both became parents in June, of a child called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about the fact that 'I had to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are more important things about Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be here to be in the first row, Dad'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I had not yet realized that it was invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley won the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a public house in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small's Proud - which had a special meaning for him in the preparation for the Olympics and still brings him the oat skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The outside mickelson shape placed in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will sign a record Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming a miserable billion-dollar stone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a twelve-time record, was placed in a bench by Captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the five times the champion spent the day between making a cheerleader and working on his own game in the range, hoping to correct what is bothering him.
Having never been the strongest driver even at the edge of his career, the 48th is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the disconnected route regularly penalises the wrong hits.
And if the course by itself was not quite discouraging, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces the accurate British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who has collaborated with novelty Tommy Fleetwood to win all and four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the beginning of their 12 single matches, start with a balling start, the Mickelson match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pack on my shoulder, put a arm around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Fury told me.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably wasn't supposed to play two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went and this is the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Mickelson Sunday will overcome Nick Faldo's record for the largest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never even reflected the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winning games, 20 defeats and seven pairs, even though Fury said his presence has brought tangible goods to the team.
"It's funny, sarcastic, argumentative, likes to play people, and it's a great boy to have in the meeting room," he explained.
"I also believe that the younger players had fun sitting against him this week, something that was fun to look at.
He's done a lot more than playing"
The Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a backlog.
The Danish began meeting in 1997 in Valderrama, where the team, captain of Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point distance from the Americans, reached the target line with a minimum advantage, winning 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
"I continue to say that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but little," said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5-3 and yesterday for 10-6, at Le Golf National.
"So it'll be history to prove to me and to my team that it's not over.
We need to give the maximum tomorrow.
You have to go out there and do everything in the right way.
It's not over until the points are marked in the sink.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players of my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Happy with the way his men raced in that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have overcome.
Tomorrow's a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is something else.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you're just your golfer skills are tested hard.
This is the message you have to convey to players: tomorrow, you have to pull out the best of yourself.
Then you forget about your partner because he also has to go there and pull out the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will seek the best individual performance in his players more than a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have collected three points on four.
The same Furyk was found by both parties at those big meetings on the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing against the European "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every single word," he commented in answer to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players in the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to go right away as we did in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When the game begins to take a certain turn, pressure increases in intermediate games.
That is why we organize our training in consequence and classify the boys in the way we think it is appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counterfence and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
Germany's new military ship has been resealed
According to local media, the latest German military fleet would have had to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the cold times of the war, but there will not be at least until next year due to faulty systems and an impasse of costs.
The Commission of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the admiral ship of the new baden-Württemberg class, was posted until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the military Navy in 2014, but worrying issues after delivery have tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the military Navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-air and anti-nautical missiles as well as some hidden technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use new brakes up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continued delays imply that innovative warships, which say they will allow Germany to project its ultimate power, will become obsolete when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate Freight Type F-125 reported last year, when the German military Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the military Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
We knew little about the reasons for the return, but the German media noticed a number of crucial "defects of software and hardware" that made the ship useless if used in a combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important since the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the older Bremen class.
In addition, it has emerged that the ship is definitely too heavy, and this reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the Rhineland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tons, is twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the faulty hardware, even the cost of the whole project (including equipment training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems that it has reached EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems involved in the new brakes become particularly important in the light of recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, parliamentary commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military Navy actually "has been unable to be employed".
The official has said that the issue has deteriorated considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the bad guys in the Baden-Württemberg class could join the military Navy.
The National Trust spreads the secret life of the pipers
New research carried out in a holding of the Scottish Highlands is aimed at revealing how the guns use the view to search for food.
It is hoped that the discoveries can shed light on the behaviour of the only existing flying mammals and guide future protection activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano guns, as well as the brown earrings and the Daubenton guns at the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special registrants will be located in key locations around the property to track the activities of the pipstrills during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using portable detectors.
The analysis of the sounds recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of the vibrations and the manner in which each species behaves.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be produced to create a detailed picture on the scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Consultant, hopes that the results can reveal what habitat areas are most important for the pipstrills and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management works, such as the creation of meadows, and how to best maintain the forests for pipstrills and other related species.
The population of the pipstrills in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly in the last century.
Pipistrells are at risk because of construction and development works that are interested in triple and ruin the habitat.
The wind turbines and lighting can also constitute a threat, as well as the tissue paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
Pipistrels aren't really blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles to their path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the guns very seriously.
Ten qualified experts conduct regular surveys, inspect the tricycles and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation has even set up the first reserve of Scotland to be used only for the pipstrills in Thrave, in the region of Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of the ten species of pipstrills in Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, claims that the property is the ideal territory.
"Here in Thrave we have a vast area for the pipstrills," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot about the guns we still don't know, so the work we're doing here and in the other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs."
It underlines the importance of controlling the pipistrells before driving maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single stem cell can kill up to 400 females and small ones, perhaps by spraying out a whole local population.
Pipistrels are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, disturb them or destroy their treasures.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about our guns and for many of our species we don't know how their populations pass it."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers cause the German weekly
Christian Ronaldo has labeled the allegations of rape against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to advertise" with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to cause the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker of Juventus was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel also noted on Friday the charge of the payment of $375.000 to maintain silence on the accident.
In a video on Instagram directed to its 142 million followers, in hours after the charges, Ronaldo, 33 years old, has strung the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five times Palone d'Oro directed towards the camera.
"They want to advertise themselves through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for making my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's okay," he added the footballer smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to bring charges against Der Spiegel, defined as "an unacceptable reporting of suspects in the private sphere".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the footballer will ask for compensation for "moral damage to the extent corresponding to the seriousness of the privacy violation, which is probably one of the most serious of the personal rights of recent years".
The event would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga would be back in the football room, where he was subjected to analytic violence, as reported in the statements filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga argues that Ronaldo would have been put on his knees after the accident by saying that he was for "99 percent" a "good boy" disappointed by "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had a sexual relationship, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also stated that she had gone to the police and hospital, where her injuries had been photographed, but that she had subsequently agreed to a reconciliation agreement because she felt "terrorized by the returns" and worried about the prospect of "coming publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old is now trying to rescind the agreement, claiming to be still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the accident, and this summer he will join the Italian Youthus with a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: the United Kingdom will compensate for the loss of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom "needs to compensate forever" for the loss of its world leader status in the construction of cars after Brexit, said the Minister of Industry Greg Clark.
He also added that he was "anxious" about the statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC about Britain's possible exit from the EU without an agreement and the resulting momentary block of production in the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese Automobile House argues that delays at the borders, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, could affect jobs.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis factory in Burnaston produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
It increases the concern of other British car manufacturers for the EU's exit without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, maintains that after Brexit will close its mini installations in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain encountered by the manufacturers in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is managed on the basis of the concept "just in time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from English and European car suppliers.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be difficulties at the borders that would cause delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than one day of inventory value in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely thought to avoid these obstacles at the borders".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but to take this opportunity," said the BBC Radio Today programme 4.
"The test, not only by Toyota but also by the other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what was a chain of great success."
Toyota was unable to say how long production could stop, but in the long term it warned that additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of plants and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the union delegates of the plant, says that the workers are deeply concerned: "On the basis of my experience, once the jobs are reduced, they are no longer reintegrated".
A spokesman for the government said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be sent back again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Justice Vice-Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "remained for a week", while continuing the debate on Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who focuses on Russian interference with the elections, the links between Councillors of Trump and Russia, and the possible obstacle to justice by the President.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thus endangering Mueller's independence, has fed Washington's gossip for months.
During the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a shirt to record talks with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and shouted that he was going to give up himself.
Instead, it was announced on Wednesday a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was sent back to avoid an overlap with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Ms. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of training of the FBI's questions against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final vote of the Senate.
Sunday, Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Interviewed at the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "A date has not been set, it could be this week, I imagine it will be another week considering everything that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press."
Some journalists might answer this statement: Sanders does not have a briefing with the press at the White House since 10 September.
Driver Chris Wallace asked for a reason.
Sanders said that the lack of briefing is not due to an advert for television journalists "who put themselves in a show", although he said, "I don't sit with the fact that they put themselves in a show".
So she thought that direct contact between Trump and the press could be more frequent.
"The President holds several sessions of Questions and answers from any president before him," he said, adding without quoting the evidence: "We have checked the figures."
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace briefings with press and you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
The press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown the reason for this, making a free-wheel talk, and at the same time freaking out, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the European workers of the Scottish NHS to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working at Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
The Scottish Parliament Member Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance of the UK leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of registered status requests (satisfied status) for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "Over the summer there have been continued negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to the autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in case of a scenario without agreement.
I know that this is a period of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Members from all over the EU, and not just themselves, provide valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and communities to which we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie has been operated urgently following a head injury
The defender of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after having reported a head injury in the Saturday party against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31-27, as reported by Mike Organ of The Tennesseen newspaper.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told reporters that the incident that caused the injury occurred shortly before the break-up.
"He got close to the shipyard and he got lost," Reed said.
The first aid workers and the medical staff have given Abercrombie oxygen to board camp before putting it in a barrel and taking it away for further tests.
A director of Tennessee State referred to Chris Harris of the Nashville WSMV, Tennessee, who Abercrombie underwent surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no news about the type and the entity of the damage" and that the Tennessee States are trying to understand when it was hurt.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is at her first season with the Tennessee States after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five tickets before leaving the match, which took his total season to 18 tickets.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher ball taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher ball taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, according to the new Labour Plans
The maneuver will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in ball tax will apply to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury Ministry plans to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher ball taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
The maneuver will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise to provide more affordable and higher income accommodation.
The increase in ball tax will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional resources will be supported by the Government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of homeless people.
The surplus, which is added to the current ball tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and on the real estate buy to lets (purchase to be rented), could amount to more than 3%.
The Ministry of the Treasury provides that the manoeuvre can collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
An estimated 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, increasing prices and making it difficult to enter a first house in the real estate market.
Many of the country's richest areas, especially in the capital, have become "phantom cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time away from the state.
The new policy arrived a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a cut on the ball tax to help the younger people with the purchase of the first house.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking over land without using them and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up on affordable accommodation allowances to settle the British "immobility" dispute.
Mr Corbyn has announced an excellent series of proposals for the reform of the housing market, including checks on rents and the elimination of evictions without fault.
He also wants to give the council more power over the construction of new properties.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said I would be committed to restoring the British dream, which is that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right if the purchase of a house was equally easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, as it is for British workers.
For many people the dream of having a house has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest wish is to guide Scotland"
The technical director of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "maximum aspiration" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is attracted by the challenge of solving the North-East team currently in the third place in League One, three points from the top.
He comes to the Stadium of Light this summer after being the guide of St. Mirren during the Scottish Premiership of the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I was in series B and that's all," Ross said to the BBC Scottish Sportsound program.
I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as manager of a team."
Ross' predecessors led by Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former technician argues not to feel any anxiety about following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"The success for me at this moment is measured by the ability to bring the team back to Premier League."
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I can get the team fired."
Ross' career starts three years ago, after a period as a coach in Dumbarton and 15 months as a substitute coach of the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa save himself from falling back to third level and took St. Mirren from the backdrop to the championship championship title, the next season.
Ross supports feeling much more comfortable now than during his football career in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real point of development," he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
"I really thought the manager's role had been set for me, more than the player's role.
It seems strange because I worked well, I earned a living, and I had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to deal with weekly.
I still deal with them in terms of stress and work pressure, but management seems good.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it, I feel much more calm than I've ever been in my life."

The summer heat wave has led to more incest for the English public in difficulties and more concern for the restaurant services.
The data show that pub and bar have seen an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, while the entrances of restaurants have fallen by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's commercial consulting company, put together the data and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England in the worlds made it so that the month of July followed a path similar to that of the month of June, when the pubs were above 2.8 per cent, while the restaurants were more severely hit.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the restaurant in June has worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where you drink more have proved the most solid, with a homogeneous increase above the drop in restaurants.
Even the pubs where you eat have suffered the heat, although not too much like the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars managed the sales of drinks are 6.6 per cent per month, while food consumption falls by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an analyst in the recreational and reception sector of RSM, said: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factor when it comes to retailing.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly severe in addition to the constant costs pressures.
The long warm summer could not have arrived in a worse period for the restaurants and only time can tell if the most moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary treasure."
The overall growth of sales between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the roll-out of brands.
The sales monitoring company Coffer Peach Tracker for pubs, bars and British restaurants brings together and analyzes performance data through 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion sterlings, and is the industry reference company.
A child on five owns social network secrets accounts that hide to parents
A survey reveals that a child over five, some only 11 years old, has secret social network accounts that hide parents and teachers
A survey conducted on 20,000 students from higher secondary schools revealed an increase in the "Fake on Instagram" pages
The news has reinforced the fear of sexual content
20 percent of students claimed to have a "principal" account to show their parents
A child in five, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates a social network account that keeps adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 students from higher secondary schools revealed a rapid increase in the fake account on Instagram, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is being put on hold.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to manage a "principal" account to show their parents, while maintaining a private account.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to "strange me".
The research, the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of private schools, highlighted that 40 percent of boys between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them have allowed to keep private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many adolescents are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be "voice for athletes" to the Scottish Athletics Council
Elid Doyle was elected non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council during the National General Assembly of the Administrative Body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete of the light athlete and President Ian Beattie described the nomination as a great opportunity for those who manage sport to benefit from its wide international experience in the past decade.
"Eilid has a deep respect for the Scottish, British and World Athletics community and we are sure that in Scotland the Athletics could bring a huge advantage by bringing it into the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I don't see the time to act as a voice of athletes and I hope to be able to help and help drive sport in Scotland."
The American, a 200-400-meter winner of the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medaglie, as well as a BBC opinionist, was unable to walk following a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time could tell if I was arrested and to what extent.
It was an extended job, but I was completely resumed, I learned to walk again, and today I am moving with a sense of urgency!
I thank you for your encouraging messages!".
The advertising of a shot compares mothers and cows and divides online opinion
A producer company of a shooting machine divided its opinion online with an advertising that compares mothers who feed and cows that come up.
To mark the launch of what is defined as the "first silent and undressable shooting of the world", the consumer technology company Elvie has launched an advertising in the form of ridiculous music videos to show the freedom to express itself as mothers given by the new shooting.
Four true mothers dance in a herd of cows on a track that includes songs such as: "Yes, I throw my milk but I don't have one thing" and "If I hadn't noticed, these are not mammals but my tits."
The choir continues: "Take him out, throw him out, feed him children, throw him out, throw him out, throw the milk to my lord."
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video triggered different reactions among the viewers, many of whom argued that it highlighted the "golden" of the dairy industry.
"An unhappy decision is to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are stolen a few days after their birth," someone wrote.
The Elvie Shooter Dressed With Discretion Under a Mother's Regimen
Someone else commented: "Intelligiblely traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why don't you use them to advertise a mother-to-mother shooting that will keep holding their children?"
Someone else added, "It's really pointless advertising."
Others have defended him, and a woman has even allowed herself to find the "delicious" song.
"I think it's a great idea.
If you're still breast-feeding, I'd like one.
When I used the gunshot, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a little inconvenient, but it is not far from reality.
This is a great product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a fun advertisement dedicated to mothers who use the tuition (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like "bitch."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the domestic industry."
At the end of the video, the protagonists show that they danced with the discreet gunshot infiltrated in the regiment.
The concept on which the campaign is inspired is based on the idea that many women who use the gunpowder feel like cows.
However, the Elvie shooter is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be infiltrated in a nursing regimen by giving women the freedom to move, to hold the children in arms and even to go out while they milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and ECD commented: "Elvie's shooting is such a revolutionary product that it was worth a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing the women who use the tug to the cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by showing in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new tug is able to ensure."
This is not the first time Elvie's shot has reported.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children introduced herself to the stylist Marta Jakubowski's passerby wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to a tent outside Texas
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though the monthly crossings of the borders have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the rhetorical toughness and the policy line of the Trump administration have made it more difficult to trust these children.
Most of those who relied on them were usually illegal immigrants who now fear to reinstate the possibility of staying in the country offering to do so.
The risk was increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the potential trustees and other adult members of their families would have received fingerprints and that the data would have been transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had offered to hire children alone.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80% of the people who offer to hire children or belong to their families are illegal in the country and most of them are criminals.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people," Albence said.
In order to try to process children faster, officials have introduced new rules so that some of them will have to appear in court within a month from the firm, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to those who work at the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconference rather than in person, to perpetuate their cause of legal status at an immigration judge.
Those who will be considered unfit to receive help will be promptly expelled.
The longer the kids stay in trust, the more they risk suffering from anxiety and depression that cause violent fits of anger or attempts to escape, as they say those who work at the reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position claim that the probability that this is happening is even higher in a large structure like that of Tornillo in which, due to its size, it is easier for the children's distress signals to be ignored.
They add that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or greet their friends could aggravate the trauma many are already facing.
Syria urges the US, French and Turkish employment forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even if the war had already arrived at the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally occupying the Syrian soil with the intention of combating terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without making any conditions," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011, there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it frees all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and supporting the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by the war.
On the problem of refugees, Moulem stated that conditions are favourable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "insecting infrequent fears" that push refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should only be a humanitarian problem is politicized."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid for reconstruction will not be granted in Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The diplomats of the United Nations state that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a cousin zone in Idlib, the last major fortress of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided an extensive attack by the Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem nevertheless stressed that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action has as its objective the jihadists, including combatants of the Al-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "be rooted".
The United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon a new committee of government and opposition members to extend a draft post-war Syrian constitution and prepare the way for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without interference.
Why Trump will be awarded the second term
Based on this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators perhaps hope, its presidency should not end prematurely because of an impeachment or a scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the final of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of flexion of the spectators.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first evening are more than double up to 1.05 million on the CNN and almost tripled up to 1.6 million on the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the first evening, in sharp increase compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show programme has exceeded the percentages of the network reaching 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with the most important news.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted because it's not something that can be explained," says Neal Baer, a television showrunner of ABC's "Designed Survivor" series, who tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
In Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", he has another theory.
Remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Why does he make me laugh?"
So chaos is a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the plot of Washington's vices can determine the future of Roe vs. Wade's judgment, whether immigrant families can meet or not and the state of health of the global economy.
To stop following the news, however, is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes well beyond the duty of informed citizens to follow for the sixth time a group of experts who discuss Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book "Fear", of Paul Manafort's 15 000-dollar leather jacket ("a full suit of anxiety" commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the disgusting descriptions that Storm Daniels makes of Trump's anatomical parts.
I, for example, won't be able to look at Super Mario without thinking.
"Part of the reason why what it does seems a reality show is that every night there is news," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", about the everyday presence of actors and developments in the Trump show (in contrast with N.F.L. who commends Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, otherwise you stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the northern coast of Kauai and although it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was closed at home looking at MSNBC and still was recording CNN.
He was not able to get off the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate's judicial committee and faced the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember once doing all those absurd programs and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

External cash flow in the race for the most closed elections of half a term
It is no surprise that in the 17th district there was a cash flow due to the reinstatement of a congressional district which made it clear that two members in charge are now running for the same place.
The recent redefinition of Pittsburg's suburban district brings into play Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another member in charge, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that in the old districts electoral colleges were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The 17th district race launched a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a victory of measure in the March special elections for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That place was occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump was awarded the district for 20 points.
Political opinionists have given democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought to punish El Salvador for supporting China, then changed their mind
Diplomatics have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017 a rather cordial meeting took place between the president of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the leading group of the Trump Organization to leave.
Officials of the State Department have decided to re-enter the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama following "the recent decision not to recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert's spokesman in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
However, the decision to apply sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million from Americans in aid for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on visas, would be of concern to the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and murderers.
After a number of internal meetings, North American and Central American officials returned to a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they were going to continue with the conference, thus definitively abandoning any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been tasked with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, the diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further rebuff or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson from Bolton to the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak anonymously about internal decisions.
What they told was confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who wanted to keep the anonymity.
Study the history
In the report he will publish, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstructing justice, which seems to have been sufficient evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller's investigation aims to shed light on the possible collapse of Trump with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress passed to the Democrats, Trump should answer these charges before the voters and perhaps a jury of its own as it prepares for a new candidacy.
The unknown are many and I do not intend to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as it is not the case with his counterparts in Europe.
In both parts of the Atlantic, we have to make choices that will determine how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to hold a coup against Hitler if the Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Monaco.
On that occasion we failed to escape the opportunity to avoid the years of carnival that followed.
The course of history revolves around these points of development where the inevitable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans must deal with them differently at the moment.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this very newspaper reported that last year he secretly suggested to submit Trump to intercepts, questioning his ability to cover the role of president.
Rosenstein argues that the news released on The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh will not be complete or impartial or if it will be confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not overcome these tests, democracy will have to prepare itself for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we'll do it.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light the candles of the Sabbath with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorans dei Rangers is optimistic about meeting with the Rapid Vienna
On Thursday the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing match against the Villareal in Spain, would give them the best opportunity to qualify for the Group G of Europe League.
Although due to an accident at the knee, Central Campist Graham Dorrans played his first match of the season right on the occasion of the 2-2 pair with the Villareal, he believes that this result can allow Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because the Villareal is a good team," said the 30th player.
"We've faced the game convinced to do well and we've brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremes but, all in all, the pair is a good result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last match. I am sure, however, that, with the support of the public, we will not fail.
Last year was certainly difficult because of my accidents and changes at the club level itself but now the sensations are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys have fun and the preparation is well done.
So we can forget the problems of the past season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the long-term costs of assistance
Even if those who have participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the issue in the family.
About half of the nationwide interviewees said they had talked to their spouse about the long-term cost of assistance.
Only 10% said they had spoken to their children.
According to Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Insurance Sector on the Life of Nationwide, "people want to be a member of their family to take care of them, but do not face this conversation".
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to attend if you do not communicate for a while what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be determinant for costs.
Involve a financial consultant: you can advise how to pay the expenses you have to deal with.
The choice of long-term assistance funding may include traditional insurance policy or hybrid life-saving policy to cover these expenses or to continue to pay for insurance until you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
You appoint a health care prosecutor so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and make sure that professionals satisfy your wishes if you were unable to communicate.
Also evaluate the possibility of a search for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and make sure your accounts are paid if you were unable to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is being taken to the hospital urgently.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
"It's not just a financial issue, but who are the doctors?" Martin asks.
"What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare for any event."
Man hit several times with an air rifle compressed in Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with a compressed-air rifle while he was on foot after spending the evening outside.
The victim, a 40-year-old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was hit by his chest, abdomen and one hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
He's not in danger of life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died as a result of a very severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The victim's budget is intended to rise.
The communications are interrupted and the aid authorities have failed to have any information from the Dongala Regency, a zone north of Palu near the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data on Palu and Dongala in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Centrale, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunamis, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a desert that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
Regenta, an administrative region dependent on a province, counted about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the province of Sulawesi Centrale and, above all, the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesia Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Another tsunami hit Dongala's western zone in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Seismic zone called the Pacific Fire belt and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a very strong earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries killing, along the coast of the Indian Ocean, 226,000 people, more than half of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit the southern part of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that broke out against the southern coast killing almost 700 people.
2009: an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 fell near Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
The victims were over 1,100.
2010: an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: a slight earthquake hit the Pide Jaya Regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
In this case there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people died under the mattresses.
2018: a strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of whom in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested with the charge of aggression.
Based on a statement issued Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he pulled her by the hand.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretral Facility centre and its security was set at $500, based on what KTUU reported.
According to the television network, he appeared on Saturday's trial and declared himself "probably innocent".
Palin is at risk of being charged with three first-degree crimes, namely detention up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also assigned a second-degree criminal offence with a day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin is accused of criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to signal the alleged aggression.
The case is currently under consideration by the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic aggression, of obstructing the complaint of the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a fist on her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking the violent behavior of the child to post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of the period in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity network and communications network are not working and the budget of the victims is intended to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit far from Sulawesi Centrale, which is located north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, videos show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami fell on the coast, hundreds of people were gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors call for an extraordinary capital penalty for suspects of terrorist attacks in NYC
The federal prosecutors in New York are asking for the capital penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare penalty that has never been committed by a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to ride on a bicycle track along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
On the basis of the conditions for the request for capital punishment in the southern district of New York, in order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and also "intendedly" inflicted serious bodily injuries.
According to the court document, both of these defendants can lead to a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury issued Saipov 22 indictment heads that included eight charges of murder with criminal association, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge of violence and car destruction.
The attack demanded "a true planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov brought it to an end as "atrocious, cruel and deplorable".
The preliminary notice states that "Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since New York's South District persecuted the last case of capital punishment.
The man mentioned in the trial, Khalid Barnes, was accused of the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to the ergastolo in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and accused of passing information to the Soviet Union two years ago.
The Rosenberg spouses both died on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
On the basis of the court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
The police say in front of the investigators they were proud of what they did.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to complete the attack after watching video of ISIS on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As far as the 22 heads of imposter are concerned, it has been declared innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, was said "of course disappointed" by the accusation's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accept a confession of guilt and condemn it to the ergastolo without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's group of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of the Tory Parliament states that NIGEL FARAGE must conduct the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today swore to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of the members of the Parliament of Theresa May Party suggested that he should deal with the negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative Member Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would already be out of Europe" if Farage was the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges that May must face in trying to reconcile the positions of its deeply divided party have been highlighted by the Torys in favour of staying in Europe who have participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
The Allies insist on continuing their attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labourers to choose between what May proposes and "Caos".
At the beginning of the Leave Means Leave organization held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to leave the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"We would be out of Europe by now," he said.
Member of Parliament Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan".
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be helpful.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
Bone rejected the views that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in Europe is completely false".
Parliamentarian Tory Andrea Jenkyns, Brexit's supporter, also participated in the court and told reporters: "I just tell the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the public in general, the opposition will not vote on it and does not enjoy the favor of our party and our activists who turn out to cast votes to allow us to be elected.
Let's lose the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message for May he added: "The prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises".
At first, Farage stated that politicians should be able to "feel pressure" if they intended to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let him."
In a message for the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to feel pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the popular army of this country that has voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, those in favour of staying in Europe marched on the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour start in the city centre.
A demanding number of activists pushed the Tory against Brexit flags after the group was formed this weekend.
The Labour Party has derailed the Conservatives for security problems they have had with an app from the party at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus Agreement, for unattractive borders and for unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
It's all a farce.
A good Brexit doesn't exist," he concluded.
Warren is seriously thinking about running for the presidency.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections he would think seriously if he applied for the presidency.
According to Boston Globe, the democratic senator of Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about his future during a city assembly in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, often criticizing President Donald Trump, is a candidate for the re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that could challenge Trump in 2020 was already in the air.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump settled in.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is now that "women go to Washington to set up the government, and this implies that a woman takes the highest charge".
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims players
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana on Saturday found out that they had arrested a suspect for the murder of LSU's Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the arrest of Dieteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday she had broadcast a video of the murder asking for help in identifying a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20 years old, was hit and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims brought a gun wound from fire to the head that caused his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene of the crime in possession of a gun and that he had hit Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and detained in the Parish Police Department of East Baton Rouge.
Junior player of nearly two meters grew in Baton Rouge, last season Sims has competed 32 meetings of which 10 to hold with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to the team's orders
When on Saturday Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of his partner Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would have severely conditioned the competition.
From the pole, Bottas goes well leaving Hamilton to defend himself against the attacks of Vettel in the first two rounds.
Vettel stops first in the boxing by leaving Hamilton in the traffic of the group's tail, a move that could be decisive.
Mercedes takes the next turn back in the track behind Vettel. But Hamilton surpasses it after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari pilot tries to prevent it from moving in and risking ending out after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen leaves from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
So guide the race for much of the race without stopping in the boxes for the change of tires and try to finish quickly to overcome Kimi Raikkonen by winning the fourth place.
At the end, however, you have to stop the pit at the 44th round and in the remaining 8 rounds you are unable to increase the step and overrun Raikkonen, which reaches the room.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri worked very well all weekend and was really nice to let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to win the first and second positions," said Hamilton.
A bad example of body language
At the beginning of Saturday, President Donald Trump called on Senator Diane Feinstein for his insistence that he did not reveal the contents of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which he accused of trying to rape the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
During a beginning in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony made by Ford in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate proves that people are "machines, evils and liars".
"What can happen and what is happening in the last days in the Senate where people are angry, angry, mean, bad and lying" he said.
"When there are clear signs that the news is released and the responsible say "Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you get the news?
Remember your answer... have you revealed the contents of the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn't." He added by imitating the senator.
The letter in which the Ford accused Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was released at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the indiscretion was intercepted by his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, but I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information reserved, and I did."
But his lies are not credible to the president, who, at the beginning of Saturday night, commented: "I say this, this is just a bad example of the body's language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language he's ever seen."
By continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of attempted sexual offence by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the wickedness, the evil. They don't care who hurts, who must pass over to regain power and control," the president said as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after the defeat of Friday in the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants by winning the return race for 5-3 Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants immediately took advantage of two goals on Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team to the bet before Dwyer reported the Giants in favor.
Francois Bouchard marked the match for the Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for the men of Adam Keefe who had returned to Belfast on Friday evening and won the match with the Dundee for 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times in this season and the Giants have won the first three matches.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 on Kendall McFull's assistant, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assistant.
In what was a rather animated first time, Sullivan reported the home team in departure at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the apartment assistant to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer has decreed the advantage for the Giants by marking the second goal of the evening at the end of the first time.
The home team went together and Bouchard rejuvenated the pair after a strategic maneuver at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to the action of Nielsen that brought the Dundee in advantage for the first time in meeting at the end of the second time and decreed the victory of his team by marking the fifth goal at the end of the last time.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five meetings at this point, will play the next home game in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be called up as a hero after he is killed to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take them safely.
More than 800 people are dead and many are scattered because of a very strong earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong assistance shots continue to interest the area and many are intertwined among the macesries in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues were fleeing to save his life, the twenty-first Antonius Gunawan Aggang remained in his place in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri di Palu Airport, which was horrified.
He wanted to make sure the Batik Air 6321 flight, which was on the track, was able to take off safely.
So he threw himself out of the control tower when he thought he was going to crash.
He died at the hospital later.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirat said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by the Australian ABC News broadcaster.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It's really sad news for us," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach the thousands and the national disaster control agency will indicate that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The count of the dead is intended to increase because many bodies are still under the mattresses and it has been impossible to reach many others," explains the spokesperson of the Soupo Purwo Nugroho agency.
Where high to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and live.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
The clean water is scaring.
The mini-arkets are packed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the men of the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", according to CNN.
During the year Indonesia was already hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people were killed.
Aerial disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a spread after the accident of the lagoon
The airline of the plane that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members were able to save themselves, now he claims there is a dispersion.
According to Air Niugini news, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing at the call.
The airline has confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
The local vessels were able to rescue the other passengers and the crew after the incident occurred while the aircraft was trying to land at the airport of the island of Chuuk.
According to official sources, on Friday, seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline claims that six passengers have been recovered at the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable conditions.
What caused the incident and the exact sequence of events are not yet clear.
The United States airline and the Navy argue that the aircraft is rushed into the lagoon because it has not reached the track.
Some witnesses say the plane crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived at a very low rate.
"And it was really a fortune," said Jaynes.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, were able to reach the aircraft's emergency exits.
He added that the flight attendants were made to panic and scream and that he was slightly hit on the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some Marines who were working in the vicinity to set up a bridge have provided aid using a rubber to transport people on the shore before the plane was inundated in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died in incidents of aircraft on the lines registered with PNG but none of them have involved Air Niugini.
Analyst rebuilds the night of the woman burned alive
On Saturday we concluded the presentation of the evidence of the charge in the new trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The analyst of the United States Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone data to rebuild the movements of the twenty-nine accused Quinton Tellis and the ten-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed that he had recovered the location data from several cells that showed that, contrary to what he said, Telllis was with the Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with the Chambers during the period he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford went to court on Saturday and testified that that day was not in town.
When the public ministry asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, the latter confirmed that he was "alking because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Telllis said he knew Chambers for two weeks when she died.
On the other hand, cell data indicate that they only met for a week.
Rowlett explained that after the death of the Chambers, Tellis removed from his phone the messages, calls and contact information from the Chambers.
"He cancelled it from his life," Hale said.
The defence will begin its concluding argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to take place later on the same day.
The High Breed: what is the hip-hop conscious?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by inserting positive messages into its tracks.
The High Breed Group of Bristol argued that the hip-hop was far from its origin when spreading political messages and denouncing social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to their origins and again make a kind of hip-hop conscious.
Artists such as the Fugees and Commons have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
A New York father quotes a couple in court for firing her with a "racist" text
In New York, a father cited a couple in court for having dismissed her in a discriminatory manner after receiving a wrong text in which his mother complained that she was "another black".
The couple refuses to be racist by comparing the request to a true "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, mother of two children, expressed his disappointment when she discovered that her new father, Giselle Maurice, arrived for her first working day in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after having noticed the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Faxman "infirmated" fired Ms. Maurice saying that she was not happy with their former father, an African American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
She paid Ms. Maurice's day of work and sent her home with a taxi.
Maurice cited the couple in court and, to be fired, she seeks compensation for the beauty of $350 per day for the six months of full-time work for which she was initially hired, even without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this," he said on Friday to the Post adding "I know it's a discrimination".
The couple responded to the charge of racism by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the only thing to do because they were afraid that they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent you a message in which she said something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco's husband at the Post.
"Would you trust your children in a person with whom you were escorted, even if it was wrong?
Your grandson?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a true "extortion", Plasco has said that the wife has been born for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"There can't be a person like that.
It is not very kind of behavior," the financial consultant added.
While the legal case is still under way, the court of public opinion has just denounced the spouses on social media by criticizing them for their behavior and for the logic followed.
A letter reveals that the editor of Paddington was afraid that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, comments on the letter: "It's not easy to put on those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's fun now that we know the great success of Paddington."
He said that the father, who was working as a cameraman at BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a playwright, would not have responded well to the rejection of his work, adds that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a bit "suffer" after his death last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as "a very important member of our family" adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, not a supposed person," he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he was acting like when you have a son who achieves a goal: you are proud of him even though he is not worthy of you.
I think he would have interpreted Paddington's success this way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed merit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my daughter who was dying.
Upon landing, the daughter was urgently transported to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn't have done it," says Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then he called me to tell me she was gonna die in a few minutes and I had to say good-bye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medications that the doctors had given them to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly burning.
She died a little while before, and it was over.
I had to sit down and wait knowing this was happening.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on to it."
After all, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was in love with the loss of her daughter, got on board the plane with the other passengers who were ashamed of what was happening to her.
"No one knew," he said.
"All the time I've done nothing but cry low-headed.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I heard an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Two-woman painless tickets to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed themselves to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked on a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was killed at 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel like I feel every day," he says.
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, tells us that his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that it lit up every room in which it entered."
But before he died, he left work because the depression had led him to "a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found him after he had taken his life.
Davis says, "I continue to fear that a chain effect will occur."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don't have to isolate themselves, they have to talk."
Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother died.
"You never said you felt down or down," he says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
Christmas day touched the bottom. When the children opened the presents, he avoided looking at them in the eyes."
He says his death was a huge trauma that they had to develop: "He has lashed the family.
He made us pieces.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain: the FBI has launched investigations
"I think that if we could do as he asked, or with a limited investigation in time and within, we could reach an agreement," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee itself "lost the peace" because of the blockade of the radical supporters.
Why do Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to be indicted?
Their determination is due to the choice of time.
Only five weeks are missing from the mid-term elections, November 6th. If Republicans as planned will get a negative result, they will be very weak in their attempt to elect the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators under pressure to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him met Ashley's wife, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has completed its report?
We shall vote in the Senate, which is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes to the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to break the indubits and confirm them to the Supreme Court.
The number of political refugees in North Korea "diminished" with Kim
A South Korean legislator states that the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came into power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting the data from the Ministry of South Korean unification, states that refugees were 1.127 last year against 2,706 of 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are a more stringent control of the border between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs asked by those who make these people go out illegally.
Pyongyang has not issued public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them with force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations on denuclearisation that are in a state of emergency.
This after the historic meeting of June between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticised US sanctions for the lack of development since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security, and in these circumstances there is no possibility that we are going through unilateral disarmament at first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh as "sterical" and argues that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The leader of the Nancy Pelosi minority defines the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as "sterical" and states that it is not characteristicly suitable to cover such a task.
Pelosi expressed this opinion on Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman had acted in the same way, they would have defined her as Žarica," said Pelosi about the statement made by Kavanaugh on Thursday before the Senate Judicial Committee.
Apparently excitedly Kavanaugh denied the charge of sexually harassing the teacher Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the forefront of emotion, so much to come almost to scream and with the close throat from the crying while he was talking about his family and the years at the high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's democrats who defined charges against him as an "absolute and coordinated defamation campaign" organised by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelos believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has proved to be prevented from being against the Democrats.
"I think you're self-exclusiond with your statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when he was asked if he would try to put Kavanaugh in charge if it was confirmed and if the Democrats should reach the House of Representatives.
"I think that if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only is he not suitable for the Supreme Court, but not even for the court that now presides," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the Circuit of the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because it is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh raised questions about his intentions to overthrow certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
Pelos said that "You cannot send a rojac person to the Supreme Court and claim that this decision is welcomed in a positive way".
And women have to use it.
It is a right diatrib, months and years of angry attacks from which it can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we get up," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And she continued, "She helped me very much a woman who was leading somewhere. She told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that when she was angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
I thought yours was a brilliant idea."
The tears are tolerated as an outbreak of anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the nicest memories I have of a previous job in a male-dominated office laughs when once I started crying for an angry access. An older woman than me, an ice manager from whom I was always slightly terrified took me for a collar and dragged me along the stairs.
"Don't ever see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Member of the Congress of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his race to the presidents.
In 1987, when a boat called Monkey Business discovered Hart's extra-marriage report that had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not have tried herself to run for the presidency.
"In fact, it wasn't a well-balanced decision," she said to me in her 30s later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and there was no need for another one.
Someone called him "Biancaneve and seven Nani."
Since the campaign was already in an advanced phase, Schroeder was late with the fund-raising and I swore that he would not have applied if he hadn't collected $2 million.
It was a lost cause in the beginning.
He discovered that some of the supporters who had given her $1,000 would have given her only 250.
"Do they think I can get a discount?" he wondered.
When he spoke to announce that he would not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who supported it, disappointment towards the system that made it more difficult to find money and voters that representatives and anger for the sexual discrimination of which he was a victim) that he committed.
"He seemed to be precipitating a nervous breakdown," said Schroeder, thinking about the press reaction.
"Someone might have thought that Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would have written on my stone.
Maybe "Pians a lot."
How the US-China trade war could favor Beijing
The outbreaks of the trade war between the US and China have been fragile and, while the battle is all but over, experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year, charging the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new duties on articles for more than $200 billion (EUR 175 billion) of value, which means that taxes will be applied on half of Chinese goods.
Beijing has reacted with similar measures each time applying recent duties from five to ten percent of US$ 60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the US hits and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon go back.
Because Washington refuses, he should give up his requests, but getting public to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the United States can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what has been recognized so far," says Abigail Grace, a researcher who studies Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, supports foreign minister
Syria says to be ready for the return of the refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by the more than seven years of war.
In view of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their support.
According to the United Nations estimate, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million still living in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would accept voluntary assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any aid under the conditions or by those countries that supported the insurrection.
Europe conquers the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europe team won the Ryder Cup 2018 beating the US team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National out of Paris, France.
The United States has thus lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points that were used to beat the United States.
USA champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, launched his tea shot in the water at the sixteenth hole of the par 3 granting victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his tournaments by becoming one of the four players always making a 5-0-0 record since the tournament with the current formula was first debated in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with a score of 5&4 by the Danish lower player in the ranks of the European team Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, has set up for 2+1 in English Ian Poulter who might have argued his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, who argued about it eight times, has become the European player who won more in the tournament's history with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do less.
It's been a tough year.
I thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to have regained the cup.
It is a victory of the team and I am happy to have made my contribution," said a excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the witness to his countryman John Ram who beat the US Tiger Woods golf legend with a score of 2+1 in the singles on Sunday.
"If I think I've grown up looking at his meetings, I'm really proud to have beaten Tiger Woods," said Twenty-Thirty-nine Rahman.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now the count of his meetings in the Ryder Cup is 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 pairs.
A strange statistics if you think it's one of the biggest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, according to Jack Nicklus alone.
The US team has been looking all weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europe team.
We've taken this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players behaved very well.
I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll go ahead.
I'm in love with these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We put it all on.
But they played better than us."
