What is it? The ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort nor the pastry
The new ČSSD councils in the capital will seem to have to overcome the obvious linguistic barriers so that the members of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council understand their newly renewed ODS partners.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" members of the new Council of ČSSD to check their knowledge of the sign language slang that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled in Prague.
The coded dictionary that used Prague's flower and political birth during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Well, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proved that the new councillors do not understand these well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is I don't know."
"I'm rather an innovation in Praguen politics," said Lukáš Kaucký, a cultural council member during the "college" terminology examination.
And as for the political veteran, he reacted similarly to Karel Brzezina.
Maybe they know the concept of golf.
"Maybe the only expression of all that you asked me to use from time to time."
"If not, normally not slang employment."
From the glossary, whose definitions were published in Aktuální.cz last June before the ODS voting congress, the drafting chose six examples, in particular those specifically related to the Prague municipal authorities.
The Socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "greatest hole in Prague's golf", "go to the pastry", "no bull", "traition of the capital" and "blind".
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a room, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague in the future, initially agreed, but did not take the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolinek, refused to do so directly.
"I don't get involved in these things nor do I want to appreciate how the Democrats have fun."
"What I do care about is how we understand ourselves in the implementation of our programmes," he said.
As has been seen, the councilman Lukaš Kaucký would not have realized that the previous title is an expression of an influential businessman and a friend of the mayor Well, Roman Janousek.
Kaucký's word "Voldemort" doesn't say anything; the only term he took in the exam is "the largest golf course in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, who immediately adds: "But I know it for the news."
"I'm going to have to point to a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf course the Blanka tunnel, but also the environmental councillor Lukaš Plachý.
Then both socio-democratics know who Voldemort really is and Lukaš Plachý even knows where to find that character; he also suspects the meaning of "go to the pastry".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague," he soon revealed to Plachý that it is the headquarters of Janousek companies.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge got them from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among the socio-democratics.
"I asked my companions, but it really seems we don't have anything like it."
"Well, among us we use pillows, sometimes abbreviations, or we play word games with names," says ČSSD president Pragune, Petr Hulínský, whose partymates call Hulda.
"In college they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my companions call me that," confesses her own apode Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aktuální.cz tested the name and function.
For his partymates, Weinert is Děda (like "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the fraudulent elections during the party's sponsorship, receives the "Igráček" (playmobil) podo by some of his companions.
The slogans are also the only expressions that socio-democratics tolerate in the speech within the party.
Hulinský does not like to call him Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuální.cz has even discovered other pieces for this Prague president.
"The Doctor of the Rights of the Pores" seems to recall that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the “wounds”, as published in a leaflet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They usually have an advanced age, they cannot work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
Women who "want" witches are sent to an isolated area so that they do not harm the rest of the people.
"Men rarely suffer so much."
"It also does not isolate healthy young women, because they help in work and have children," one nun explains that, in the capital of West Africa Burkina Faso, more than one hundred women are evicted from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information leaflet that should help to avoid witch hunting.
However, this has a grip.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso don't know how to read," warns Die Standard newspaper on the disadvantages of writing sensitization.
Magic charges are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, last week Amy Hemmah died at 72 years of age, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gas and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to its version, the woman was taken into the oil used for ritual weddings.
He was arrested when the group wanted to "evict the evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of the "whispers" supports people at all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "Human soul devourers have always been a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government is trying to calm down the witch hunt, last year in Gambia the president still participated in it.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a large hunt of witches who allegedly had been related to his death and tried to kill his own president by means of black magic."
"To help you bring calls from nearby Guinea that, protected by police, military and the president's personal hearing, led to the force of men and women randomly chosen from among the Gambian peoples to the property of the President in Kanilai," the Amnesty International organization points out in its report.
In the farm, the arrested people had to drink a handful of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the detainees didn't survive in the fence.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detainees.
Bakala rental: it is heated with coal stoves and sign a higher rental
The man, aged and retired, crossed the doors of the care center to the customer of the RPG Byty company of Zdenýk Bakala, the largest private owner in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-bed rental contracts: his, his daughter and his son, who is carrying out the sentence.
The three have just taken away the liberalisation of the tenants.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay 4,100 crowns from next year on a two-bedroom floor with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," he shows with his finger the man in his son's new contract, on which the firm has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains half angry, half fired.
The BytyOKD.cz civil association, which described the new rental conditions as "inaccurate and inappropriate", recommends to tenants who do not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, the date on which it will publish a guide informing about how to proceed in these cases.
But before this, man only makes an adman.
"Everyone says something," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory for tests of liberalization.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
Therefore, Aktuální.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mine waiting room is one of the four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Just next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to pick up a number.
"Rent 2011", can be read in a light button on your touch screen.
When you press it, get out of the machine a paper with a number.
Almost doesn't even give time to read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Shortly thereafter, an advanced marriage arrives to ask, but the majority of the room is not here for the new tenants.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as past requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar issues.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava at the premises of the tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes an increase in the rental of between 15 and 38% in the letters.
A special window is opened on 18 November in the customer care centre for new tenants.
"It's been working for a week, so it's starting," they say, after a short doubt, the workers who are in it when the customer presents themselves as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old floors for Bacala miners are the most delicate issues in the area.
Prior to the elections, they have already been treated with high and clear treatment by the Vice-President of Parliament, from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, from ČSSD, and are now continuously appearing in the local newspapers.
"I want a new floor twenty years later."
"They didn't change me the damn dish of the bathroom," says the man mentioned in the introduction.
According to the workers, for the time being more than nothing retired to check if they receive a discount in the rental if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December will also receive half of the discount on the rental of February.
However, the window of the "liberalization" mine is certainly not able to unbundle the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about the rental in 2011 about forty-five people," she said.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes to hold individual meetings on contracts on the web and its tables where necessary.
If both parties do not reach agreement on the rental, an independent judge shall resolve the matter.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed and fully in accordance with the law," warns RPG on its pages.
"No one will be judged here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man who is on the street in front of the customer's attention center gives him at least in part the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I do not have the means to go to the courts," he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns you in the media that they don't sign, so maybe people are waiting," he says.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rentals do not even cover the necessary amounts for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimesh, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for owners, the main reason for increasing the rental.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest with tenants in apartments of 4 billion, the figure will increase to 5,200 million in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
The large screen that hangs from the ceiling, in front of the sittings of the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlights in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 is 15% and less applicable to 31200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7,50 monthly check crowns per square meter," is indicated on the screen.
Only increased by 38% is the rent of 400 floors from the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low quantities of 19.66 crowns per square metre," says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not impact tenants by hitting them, but will scale between four and eight years.
In addition, add the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rental elevator (see the graph) again on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
People who sign the rental elevator agreement will have priority.
Architects have understood that offices also need custody
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides inside a small wardrobe with all its own facilities: color walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to her.
The Arch.Design architectural project company, from which numerous well-known buildings of Brno were studied, thought from the first boxes of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mining.
At the company they work around 90 people, mainly at the age of baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the store is one of the benefits Arch offers.Design your workers within your social program.
Constructors and architects thus have the opportunity to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mining was an idea of Arch's own employees.Designu and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mining is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (over 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to purchase equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified personnel and services.
When you run out of funding (two years), Arch.Design has an obligation to keep the mining company running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted for one year and the company Economy Rating contributed to the submission of the funding application.
Children's attention is in the hands of qualified staff; moreover, a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education are present all day. The ward currently welcomes children with no age limit, although most of them are under three years old.
Since it is a "miniguardery", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children at the same time, although with the shifts they go further during the day.
The operation of the guard is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the guard, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is individual education and care, the contents of the minority programme are comparable to the routine pre-school education programme.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality education: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach to English.
The class has not only toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of small children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of late collection of college children when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive as they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally creates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is located between companies sign that they offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of staff.
The house of the bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. The interiors of Gaudí are observed
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lagoon, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Batlló House in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its similar shape to a skeleton, the locals seized it "the house of the bones".
Its organic shapes, its appealing colors, the innovative use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that recalls the scales and omnipresent gently curved lines, all this is typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The cover of the house plays with oniric lines, delicate colors and textures extracted from nature and fauna.
By paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm, and a carefully thought - out order are observed.
At night, the whole facade of the house seems even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
The snake and the torsion of the shapes continues to surprise us also within it.
The walled wood copies the frames of the windows, the rocks, the decorations of the doors, the mirrors and the letters.
The Batlló House, which is located in the Eixample district in number 43 of the animated shopping street of Passeig de Gràcia, arose from the remodelling of a house in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on breaking down the previous building and starting at zero, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of making a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Batlló House, made up of several apartments, did not design it by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in their plans of the project there were decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
In the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Batlló House was the beginning of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Mila House and the Güell Park of Gaudí, where other parts of it are located.
Because of its organic form, the premises soon after its completion seized it "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it "the house of drawers".
It is also said that, at the height of the construction, the sword of San Jorge, patron of Catalonia appears.
Other sculptural elements of the building hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for central heating time with ventilation ventilators and typical fireplaces.
It may turn out to be a strange slope of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not comply at all with the construction standards of the moment and was not allowed to be influenced by them.
Still, the construction was granted the relevant permit from the beginning, although obviously the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the town council was so affected by the result requested to be corrected.
He was upset, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public steel.
The arrangements were never made, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the city's request, Josep Batlló requested permission to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
The owner himself was installed on the lower floors.
In the gallery of the second floor there was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelery.
The house, with six floors, is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the terrace of the roof.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all right angles and lines, covering them from curved walls.
Gaudí also worked on the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the halls and a larger group can be communicated in this way without problems, without giving up the necessary privacy for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only obtained a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white tiles and blues that cover the inner courtyard and tragaluces.
The game with the two colors provides the maximum light on all the floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that the white reflects more light than the dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the rays of the sun.
Anyone can visit the Batlló House, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it was a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and to the busherilla, including the terrace of the roof.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, reaching EUR 16.50, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get 20% discount.
The amount exceeds significantly the price of the entry of other buildings of Gaudí in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lagarto towers, you should quickly become a friend of any resident of neighboring houses and visit it at home.
How to choose the bed and bed: women and men seek different things
Nothing of a pumpy frame for the bed; what really gives its quality to a good bed is the surface to dive, i.e., the bed and sleep.
First of all, they must be complemented by perfection in order to adapt to the specific users.
During the election, numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, health and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and somier are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cottage that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they are "heated" more slowly.
In addition, they suffer considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the central channels are not properly irrigated and, above, they are on a solid basis, they remain within the moisture. Even mojo can appear below.
When choosing a bed, they also influence habits.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have problems feeling well on a lower and hard surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep well here."
"For their sharp shoulders, heels and chairs they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes that time problems of the nervous system, so they get poor information about joints and skin," explains Silva Hadamkíková, who specializes in the covered furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, spend time preferring viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the tropical brand."
You don't have to be a NHL player anymore so you can appreciate viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimise your stiffness and shape depending on the absorbed heat or adapt to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn like after a hard match.
Just, you know, if I sleep better.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against laxatives.
By choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, for example singles, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple norm to calculate the width: at the top of your mouth, you should have your hands comfortably glued to your elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu čaluníków to decorators, who has been busy for many years with the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, a subject that teaches in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each one needs his own bed and mattress, so during the purchase you must pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to assemble the sleeping bags at different times, which is not always possible in all beds.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with spring inside a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softness.
"When you touch it with your hand or lie down in the mattress, you should certainly not notice the mowers," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of sleep.
The fully covered bedrooms, where the mattress and base are like siamese, do not make sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and cannot wash their bottom, which is often done today.
And since we breathe between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat every night, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will start to remind us of a large (and congested) tamiz.
For this reason, experts reject the slogans that speak of a life of up to 25 years of hive or, even, a life guarantee.
However, everything has a butt.
Therefore, the sellers give advice: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of the cleaning and washing of the floor, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although it is currently made of mattresses with cremation closures all over its perimeter, so by opening them they remain in two parts (very important for washing and washing size!), their handling in larger models (and for one person) when lifting the mattress may seem to be a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of sleeping, does he have a firm table?
Never!
Like much for the beds thought to spend one night visiting.
However, you should make (if you don’t have them already) ventilation orifices on the table and use with an inner spring cushion and a minimum height of 15 cm with bags of spring (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articular laminated laminates and containing between 14 and 18 laminates, can be used latex lathes or sandwich lathes (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fibre), although it is always better to sleep with a larger number of laminates, 28 or more, where the laminates of the lumbar area are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
Knitted blades should not be used with a spring mattress, since it does not react to the tilting.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the blades, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fixation of the blades that allows pressure or even bend the blades in such a way that they "reel" perfectly on their shoulders during sleep.
For men with very broad shoulders, this is something very important.
Even they are remembered by the colchons manufacturers who, in the "males", began to use a softer area precisely around their shoulders.
Women are also remembered, for which they put a softer area around the chairs.
For the most demanding customers, there are dreams with cross structure or tables with the so-called multitortion depreciation.
Pressure is distributed between different points and tension is lowered.
It must also be taken into account that, although you use the right mattress and sleep, if you use a bad pillow (large and "female"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can be relaxed.
The recommended appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
On the side of the drum, the pillow must be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder with shoulder strength or the softest area of the shoulder) than the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use more and more natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils such as rice or soybean.
In fact, almost all known manufacturers use soybean.
"Biologically, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of natural materials", explains Petr Vasiček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the base of the mattresses, one of the first vera aloe.
But you can also choose from the microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma into the forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with bristle plant extracts, so that the back of the mattress absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer "heat" the back of the body.
Red pepper extract improves the circulation of blood so that women feel more heat.
Do you have any favorites right now?
Cold foam mattresses, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, make them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam rigidities allows for the manufacture of mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A high-quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered health care.
The first one to get this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and sleeping.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a foam with memory memory attached to the bottom by 11,990 crowns.
The second comes free of charge.
The age of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and a great density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it came up as a material for NASA, because during the slow astronaut discharges they were exposed to a huge overload.
Tempur melts with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to avoid laxatives, although also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is used not only in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows placed under the legs and relieved them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use the Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
More and more parents use tracking devices to control their children
The fear of children makes more and more people think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, originally designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, to the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
Currently the device has the approximate size of a lock box, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were frightened by the case of missing Anička and began to inform about the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We all try to tell ourselves that it is not a spy, but another way to reduce the possibility of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we haven't met with such cases yet."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in case of emergency.
Children's psychologist Dana Bočkova warns about the fact that if the child doesn't want to take it, he'll just throw it away.
"Even younger children show great creativity when they deliberately lose certain things if they want to avoid being controlled."
"Before, the parents relied heavily on the phones, but they could turn off as easily as the tracking device," Bočková says.
In your opinion, it is questionable if in case of attack such a device is really useful.
"If it is a prepared kidnapping, the author will practically always check if the child carries some kind of electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices expands, it will also search for them, as its sale will undoubtedly be carried out with much publicity.".
"In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack of a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is destroyed immediately, its presence can serve as aid.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period".
"If it is damaged, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person concerned."
"The most expensive devices are integrated with a tilting meter, so if the person simply rescinds and becomes mobile, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," Čech says.
In your opinion, such a service can even be obtained with intelligent mobile phones with navigation, where only a special software must be installed.
The problem with the current tracking units is that for the time being it is devices with a size similar to a lock box or smaller mobile phones.
So they can be lost.
According to Macro Weil Pilin, for that reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device."
"Or identify it after a certain time, which can make the police earn time," he adds.
While tracking devices are carried in the doll or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the check of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual car navigation) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough knives to go around all of the Czech Republic, but it only takes two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of mecha to hold explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometres [224 km] of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the mecha is two years, four to the maximum.
The army bought the STV Group explosive mecha for 40 million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNAs by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of knife, saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometres per year.
According to the military pyrotechnic calculations, with which MF DNAs were contacted, it is decided, however, that, in this case, these manoeuvres should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year also all general, senior officials, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They didn't want any exemption from either the Minister of Defence Alexander Vondr and the captain of the Vlastimil Pick army.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army spends 60 kilometres of mecha.
This length is equal to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two metres of mecha, the army would have sufficient stocks for the new purchase (including the consumption of the engineering or special units) for the 225 specified above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention squad complained personally to Minister Vondra a short time ago because they said they had only ammunition for several weapons, so even the shooting practices for money are limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of inner clothing.
"I also can't understand that they buy us all the time."
"But it's your decision, and they'll know why they're acting like this."
"For us, the army is a good client to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," says STV Group's commercial director, Jan Děcký.
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends hundreds of kilometres of mecha saying he will also have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, from STV Group, indicates that the mecha only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of military or police pyrotechnics, two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to the possible criticisms of the army, does not want to give its name.
After the end of their useful lives, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that when he bought 445 kilometers of butter, he obtained a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than last year's 244 kilometers," says the spokesperson Pejšek from the Ministry of Defence's Shopping Centre.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminates the ammo of World War II or left by the Soviet army, has not been more than 1,500 metres since.
In addition, the police always ask only the fair amount of ammunition to be exhausted before their useful life ends.
They decided it for safety reasons for the pyrotechnics and, in addition, while it is possible to achieve more modern and reliable types of mecha.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in ending tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics who spoke to MF DNAs, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the present: we will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometres of old mecha, which is now buying "barata".
So far, I've been living with the contacts I've gotten through the competition.
Winning the "Empressary of the Year" contest helped Lukaš Pytloun in the sale of his hotel's franchises.
The last edition won the competition "Entrepreneur of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukaš Pytloun de Liberec.
Your success story seems to be taken from a movie.
And Lukas Pytloun just loved traveling.
Foreigners realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he had gathered with seasonal work abroad and a bank loan he bought a house that was half-broken with five floors.
Given that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
"At present, the quality-price ratio of the accommodation in our area moved me to do something about it," says Lukaš Pytloun.
He started renting the first newly rebuilt floor to foreign workers.
All the income that gained the investment back in the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has managed to gradually open four guesthouses in Liberec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, opened up another one of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tísé, to which we have sold our concept of frankness, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun Franchise," said the businessman number one last year.
"To this sale of hotel opening licenses greatly helped to win the competition of the 'Entrepreneur of the Year'," he added gratefully.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding areas.
"People recognized me on the street, still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
No doubt, he recommends to everyone that he wants to try some company that participates in the competition.
But it considers that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live with contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he may not have obtained.
"With some people I've met thanks to the competition, I've started to collaborate on a regular basis."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included employees,
in total about seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition."
"It's not much less my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of the entire team."
"Only that is my name that appears on the first floor," says modestly today Lukaš Pytloun.
I wish my successor a year quieter than we had in Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon became dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already passed the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žjárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone competition "Company of the Year", last year in Prague's "House of Slaves".
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he managed to convert a small technical workshop to Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my associates and improved our confidence in fighting competition," said the winner last year.
Farmet's story begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed Karel Ždjarský's father to rent a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of properties during communism, he did not hesitate; he gave up his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of partners, founded the company with his father of plastic piles.
Shortly thereafter, they began specializing in vegetable oil press.
Eight years later they became the largest automatic press manufacturer in the centre of Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized public after reaching success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers start to view the Farmet brand as much better, but foreign partners also started to appreciate the collaboration with a company that gained greater success in their country," says Karel Ždjarský.
Last year may not have been in Farmet just a sample of the euphoria of victory.
It was also recognised for its commercial results until 2008 and, in part, from 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The deterioration of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and to start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We obviously didn't get rid of this situation either."
"The income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some dismissals," Karel Ždjarský explains.
A viable company must, at times, take even non-popular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the profits of the company, although at lower levels than before the crisis.
Nevertheless, where Farmet did not cut costs it was in research and development.
"With the subsidies we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence in the international market, and gained magnificent ratings at national fairs," Ždjarský says.
Everything indicates they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žjárský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous rules
The Absurdez survey of the year is part of the fourth business tournament.
You've already managed to remove some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Year's Absurdez survey was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than one third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security asked for an extract from the trade register, although its officials could obtain it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for an extract of the trade register when it carries out a control of the insured's taxes," ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buranová said.
The objective of the Year's Absurdez survey is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in Chequia must respect and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year is part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and also begins to create affection among the general public.
While last year's edition included the participation of 3,000 voters, this year almost reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several remaining legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in a number of papers necessary for the tax declaration we are in the first place worldwide," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business standards has been a declared objective of all Governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is located in position 74a, i.e. eight seats worse than last year.
The Year's Absurdez competition was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone may indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the contest organizer selects seven candidates for the "anti-premium" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
He wins the absurdity he receives more votes.
For this year's survey, more than one hundred were submitted, including 105 rules and regulations that did not make sense.
Examples were sent by both employers and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, was the requirement that vehicles for road maintenance and highway maintenance pay the rent or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of seventy proposals this year is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held early in November in the square of Wenceslao de Prague, is part of an event in which people of the political and social world often participate.
This year, for example, they attended this event of the Eva Svobodová competition, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State is constantly harassing entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year at least thirty paragraphs that are currently unnecessary to trade," said Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in the waste water.
In 2007, what was most disturbing to people was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate with a three-day advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to visit a post at a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was abolished in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended in second place in the number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the labour office by its foreign workers from work trips up to 30 days, was eliminated by the so-called green card law.
And the third one is going to win.
The 2009 Absurdez was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two bascules of soil.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had removed the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes social enterprises
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are being evaluated.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competition is the category called the company responsible for 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"This is how we want to support companies that deal with the environmental impact of their activities and support socially responsible activities," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional director of Vodafone's mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of Vodafone Company's 2010 main competition, companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective were presented.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activity varies completely from one to the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, for example, these are persons with disabilities, other than those with personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists of the whole Republic, for example, the Prussian software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in various sports tournaments.
Another example of a company in charge of the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of funds for sponsoring children with disabilities for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a paper that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, as they represent more than 70 per cent of the template; therefore, it received the title of the company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company competition of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc he won the MiRyz Soft accounting company, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also granted because it primarily buys Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities produce the least impact on the environment as possible," explains Entrepreneur Miloše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit in the region of Ústí also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; it also supports work from home and its business events uses catering services from a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the person's scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community," said the company's representative, Ondřej Suchý.
They are also located in a good place with a mention of the Prani laundry company in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive benefits in a special way that affects their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, improvement of qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, of Bruntál Czasch, a winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, it was automatically appointed to all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company competition of the year who answered the questions of the registration form and sent it to the organizers before 15 August.
Organizers removed forms that were not complete or incorrect from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the company responsible for the year, but were not disqualified from the "principal" Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual nominations for this competition are not allowed, as this is a subcategory of the main competition of the Year", explains Karel Goldman of counsellor Bison & Rose.
Police arrested during a public auction in the building of the Agricultural Fund, Pilsen
The anti-corruption police have carried out various arrests in the agricultural fund building in recent days.
The detectives married a local media businessman and real estate businessman Luboš G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the refund of rights in such a way as to ensure that the subcontracted land receives a precise interest.
That's why I should have paid Luboš G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for someone for bribes during a public auction and public auction," said Právo the chief of the general prosecutor of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that he cannot disclose any further details about the ongoing investigation.
Twenty-four hours later, the police released a 46-year-old businessman.
The way in which it could influence the public auction, given the limited official information, can only be speculated.
The spokesperson for the Lubomíra Černá Agricultural Fund answered Právo's questions saying that the police actually took the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and was during a public auction.
"It's a client, not one of our employees," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Convocation for the submission of land transfer proposals under the land law" and takes place when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a value higher than their refund, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"On the basis of the tenders, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest offer" explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Luboš G. had information on who was going to submit the summons and, at the same time, he was interested because he acquired several refund rights, proposed to the parties on the ground that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, I had so much money on it.
Luboš G. had special contacts at the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was the cause of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of disposing the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund some planned land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular where a large road should be built to the industrial area of Borská pole.
Then he changed them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate for a house in the historical center of the city with a very higher value.
In this case, the town council had to intervene because, otherwise, the land blocked would avoid construction.
Families should pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Homes will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rentals.
Consequently, families will have to get out of the wallet, starting in January, several hundred crowns per month more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, the gas rises by about 2%, in some cities up to 10% more due to water supply, and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns more a year than now.
However, the main electricity suppliers have reduced prices, as support for renewable energy production has increased, in particular photovoltaic.
However, gas is moderately fuelled, especially at a time when heating is more used and therefore more consumption is greater.
In this case, they must also have a couple hundred crowns more a year.
While electricity and gas are fuelled across the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The rise in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the households of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 crowns per month from January for central heating, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns per year.
Residents in Prague should also bear an increase of 9 per cent of the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rental does not vary, the Pragians will pay an additional 6.8 per cent.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will be set at 7.4%.
The rental prices of 450,000 apartments rented in Prague can be considerably increased, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 floors in Ústí nad Labem, will increase the rental from January to 100%.
The company will bring to the courts those who do not agree with the new rental.
The regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase the year to 10%.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in a way, because it makes a slow effect
Fernet, ron, vodka and even good whiskey stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause you to end up in young alcoholic health care at a age of less than 15 years.
The children who end up buried in the hospital are no longer an exception.
This is due to the experience of doctors who are with such cases in hospital admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get drunk."
"Now fashion is the strong alcoholic drinks," he says to Právo, the pediatrician head of the Horjovice Hospital in the center of Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they manage to get a bottle to their father of the alacena, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage that it is sweetened with zum and that it does not smell so much," he explains.
It is also confirmed by the spokesperson of the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually about Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, especially among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use the waiter who was taken home," adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelicán, they are 13-year-old drinkers who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Horjovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in the pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in about four times."
"He started twelve years when he was brought with 3.5 alcohol in blood, as well as a mixture of ecstasy," says the department's doctor about this case.
"He was at Holesovice's party at some dance party."
"It's interesting that his mother didn't surprise him that his daughter was missing 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak of dependence.
"It is understood by an alcoholic to have a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it is due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelicán.
According to the spokesman Jurinová, this year at Motol’s pediatric clinic, 40 Hebrew children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, statistics show only those with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after medical recognition, go home with their parents or the police, don't count.
In addition to the cases where children simply meet after school and drink, there are three seasons for Pelican to mention: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstances, they drink by bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of holidays."
"In the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven Hebrews children at once," adds Pelicán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible recovery at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and with nutrients missing from the body.
"These bring him much better, because after a long night, they get up well and don't hurt them."
"Only confused about where they are," says Pelicán, adding that patients often lose good humour at least when they see the costs they have generated.
The ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for severe patients cost a dozen thousand crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when I tell the children directly on the visit how much it has cost them and that they would have to spend all summer in a job for young people to earn enough to pay that night," Pelikán adds.
Medical insurance, in its opinion, may be a retroactive measure, which usually gives people back the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 planes are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 of a total of five aircraft, by which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced Casa C-295M, left for Seville on Tuesday, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
It is the first time that a device of this kind is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for practical or demonstration flights.
It is the version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three planes are L-159.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, was already charged with them last week.
Jan Pejesk, from the defence press department, indicates that it is not yet known when Vodochody's planes will be physically withdrawn.
"The L-159, on the other hand, were separated from the aircraft repaired long ago, without additional investments or contributions by the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 Biplazas were exchanged in their current state," said Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army did not remain without biplaza planes, as in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for a amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four L-159 non-necessary devices for biplazas.
One of the new aircraft has already been received by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed itself to adding aircraft to the equipment of some allies.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the one that removes L-159 aircraft and will serve for NATO country pilot practices."
"Therefore, it depends on the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," Pejšek points out.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by a home plane and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3,500 million crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for an invitation to tender and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current Defence Directorate claims that the exchange promotes future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24 so it wants to sell the rest.
Buying aircraft Home may have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by making a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three House planes and the last one should arrive at the Prague airport of Kbely in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ant indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the ant are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men under 60 years of age," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if this characteristic is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as Eeles indicates.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time of 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the cancellation.
They had the same chances of suffering from prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the cancelling finger, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men under 60 per cent, the reduction was 87 per cent.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined during the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone affects the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that he does not think that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer can be "demonstrated completely".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, saw the snow cover on Thursday.
Roads and steels are mostly covered by compact snow and the chitaniev machines circled all night over many areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between 89 and 93 kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourism, as well as the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Central Automotoklubu (UAMK).
A truck was found at 91 km, and in 93 two industrial vehicles were hit and injured.
Several tourists also ended up in the cannet.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway in the 185 km towards Prague.
There they hit two trucks.
Drivers must move slowly after Brno in the 190 km or cross Brno and fit into the 182 km in Kývalce.
There they have been formed caves several kilometers away.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a snow layer of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
They are forming fungus, for example, in Prosek, although it is also congested Störboholská.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trains run with delay, for example on the line between Karlovo namėstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three quickly.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check on the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Currently, most of the roads of South Moravia can already be flown, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to circulation, in Brnońska snow languages are forming, and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
To date, connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Milošovice.
To get rid of them, we'll need hairdressers.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will be opened for circulation.
In Hodoninska, caution is required in the area of the Carpathian Bílés (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region that, given that they are a protected natural area, should simply be left inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, as ČTK indicates.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reached 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowflakes are gradually sent to the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time being only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the progress of the game" will win.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise puncture.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives containing it causes it to actually work like a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic route.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind a barrier, a wall or a trench.
There is no doubt that normal protection cannot be used and that when it launches its deadly rain from metallic stellars, it can be essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use a "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to the same laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of view and, depending on the target, corrects the projection line and tightens the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the gun is loaded and the missile is launched at a distance of 543 metres, less than one, two or three metres," says Audette.
Transferring 400 jobs
The Fujitsu consortium transfers its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will change their place of work from their former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moved its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer sector giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July next year from their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large complex of offices on Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad neighbourhood in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that in the medium term, more than 100 employees from the consortium, previously distributed by the region, would be accommodated there.
The offer is highly attractive, as well as the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure".
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important at present for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new change of an important company in the region yesterday brought joy to those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against it.
The head of the Frankfurt Economics Section, Markus Frank (CDU) said that a Global Player has been won.
This is a "magnificent recognition of the location".
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great boost to Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management first informed the city of its intention.
"Of course we have offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz have not changed in difficulty.
At the end of the day, the economic reasons led to a fall.
Thus, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building are cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu at the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the surviving buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial project to build the city of the beach.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the town, a new entrance to the city is formed, which deals with the criticism of the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment council and rating companies were installed, the software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, from Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest global IT supplier.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and it also provides the necessary services.
The branch office in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That is why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The ancient complex of the twenty-years, its name alludes to its star-shaped plan, houses among others the central electronics association and the electronics industry.
Amazon Cancels Server - Threats to Assange
Anxiety gets more and more of Wikileaks.
Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the disclosure platform from your server.
It is possible to find political pressure behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, seems to be detained in England.
Wikileaks' revelation platform is always the white of criticism, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and businesses to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on the list of people wanted by Interpol, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the revelation activists communicated through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon service web in order to deal with high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfectly, we're going to use our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee from Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, informed the CNN chain according to a call to the Lieberman office.
The presidency of the country's Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I wish that Amazon would take these measures before, before previous information publications classified through Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and disregardable process puts our national security and threatens life in the world," said an independent senator.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with his service to expand stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is being searched for in Sweden for suspected rape, is on Interpol's list of wanted people.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has consistently described research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats have existed.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undiscovered.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to North America's statements.
In America, the former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, said that the responsible for the revelations of Wikileaks should be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, a government adviser Stephen Harper said, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange there is a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for American President Barack Obama, described Assange as "sudden and absurd" that he had requested the resignation of the Secretary of State, in case she was responsible for recently ordering diplomats involved in spying.
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The American government must demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, Deputy Director of Distribution of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed exceptional officer, Casa Blanca announced.
Therefore, Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks filtration.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as to change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that the publication of Wikileaks should be endangered in order to take care of the security of dissidents and activists.
"We've done our best to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The university of ice cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, refrigerators are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the highest flow and visitors around the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From ice cream and ice cream.
The ice cream produces cream according to all the rules of Italian art of ice cream.
The ice cream with a spatula extracts the ice cream from the sample, extends it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice creams should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of his machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the highest flow and visitors around the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practice in the fridge of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk their vague desires in the mild ice cream.
This time 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this art in California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a European product of quality in the land of industrial ice.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something for herself in some years within an exciting work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a fridge in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice creams of his bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because his children love Italian ice creams.
The cooler teacher Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only its good taste but also its thirsting mildness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training or the birth cover of the national upper house and mainly from the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is just the best, and that's why each ball has something romantic."
The first step to the development seems to be easy.
Luciano releases the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large battery, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment freezes it up to four degrees.
Then open the machine grip and exit a pasteurized white basic cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be prepared only with natural elements or without stabilising?
How can you give up some desires to experience?
Luciano advises to rid themselves of the trends of the time.
What speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", best used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably rubber rubber, of guar frijol.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite ice sound.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
Tastes are used.
With regard to the taste of ice, the teacher Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the sweets of the supermarket.
Besides, there are powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to absorb aromatic ingredients in their goods."
"However, they must ever experience."
Whether with sorbets of fruit with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with powdered cocoa as the basis for all possible sweets of chocolate.
The participants in the course can now use the refrigerators.
Luciano lets them develop each and every four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, moca and avellana, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with fruit ice types.
That you better know doesn't necessarily depend on you having more toffe or more pure fruit flavor.
It is not necessary for the ice cream of raisins to store dried fruit, if it contains more raisins.
The working group develops the adorable ice of kiwi, which uses more fruit, less water and something less stable.
First a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice, says Luciano.
The preparation of ice cream is an architectural problem: The pure melocoton with a lot of sugar is used, and the sugar ratio of the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream there is a need for an extra sugar portion.
Luciano extracts a tool to set the amount of sugar of fruit types (measurement of the viner for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the account.
Working ice cream requires no more than physical application, as before.
Not only helps the tool for automatic preparation of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, which simultaneously beats the prepared ice mixture and cools at low temperature.
In spite of all, all automation remains outside as far as the small pasta is concerned.
The Brazilian Gustavo marks himself and his companions from the top down with pure fruit, as if it were a giant miniprimier without control.
"In all courses," says Master Luciano, "it's just a matter of time that something like that happens."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority has infiltrated the industry that is experiencing transgenic plants.
This issue is currently being formulated by the Group of Experts Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, and another Efsa expert have also been hired in the Ilsi Association for years.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in the test standards of Efsa of genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interests, criticizing Then.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech criticises a conflict of interests.
Thus, shortly ago, a high-ranking manager from Ephesus was without support or the time of transition to Swiss Agriarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed his gang.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the General Office of the Environment as well as an EU parliamentary clarification.
However, Ephesus cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
It uses all formal data, including some of the industry, provided they are of high quality and technical quality, they are listed in a report.
Experts working in Ephesus are not required to have no contact with industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper supports his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is called itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among other things for assessing the risk to biotechnology without Lobby's responsibility.
Independent experts, such as Then, criticise the fact that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, makes the genetically modified maize in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to check only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how are they to be found?", question, prosecutor, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Institute of Technology.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in the US and Europe.
So there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a general rule.
"Industry controls the security investigation," Hilbeck maintains.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, a total of about 400 kilos.
Monday was at Stuttgart station, with the Tube on the back.
Events
I don't know.
The story is known: In September the diggers arrived and began to pour down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart never again became the same: thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As I was supposed, most of the wing became trash.
Route in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Eastfieldern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They mustn't disappear."
He is excited: "A cheap and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he once said, he smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of Stuttgart's stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former ammunition warehouse of the French Army, where Manuel Rongen erected his stone Stein-Reich.
The 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He's bought everything that comes from the destruction in Stuttgart.
"There would have been a shame, they would crush the gravy or they'd send it to the trash," says in his office, a wooden box that once was a guard box.
They insulted and threatened him, explaining, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, who had bought the rest of the north wing to the waste company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything about it.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilometer mill, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a reminder but also with the hope of being able to return it to a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, project manager.
They arrived everywhere and carried what they could carry in the suitcase and above.
Stuttgart's impulse stone has long since become "the wall" or the boundary of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
He rides all over the country, making a tour of his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
It holds 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the country's biggest stone dealer.
It's slow.
In the snow there are painted sandstones.
"They belonged to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he explains.
It's white, yellow, warm, it's excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Mark a lot: Red sand, an earlier piece of the Karlsruhe station.
And keep going.
"Bonito travertino."
In ancient times, the mammoths belonged to the Neckarstadion court in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, the yellow cross of Stuttgart's police chief, the red granite of the church of St. Blasien, went to the hospital of Heilbronner.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple apparatus and a cart, he feels very devout.
"It would be a scandal if something destroyed."
It has not become rich, absolutely immensely rich.
But today 14 people said to make the stone handler, as well as canters, a sculptor, a carpenter, a glassman, and a gardener have been installed in the woods.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the man who is responsible for taking advantage of the rest.
He's got to go to Colony in a little while.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fighting talent around great potential
She has an active influence on the buffet.
16 students are swallowed around the pancakes, tomato soup and sweets.
Braunschweig Technical University and Vokswagen car manufacturer have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
By rivaling and in the same way, many companies, like VW, meet in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Your mission: To hire students with the most talented of universities as soon as possible, before entering the labour market and being hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications on the skills of their students, they try to engage exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
The second day of project at Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady in the staff department shares Bolígraphs, rubbers and folders with the VW logo.
Explains to young talented young people the practical programs and work for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from Braunschweig Technical University carries the project with VW.
See advantages for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and acquire experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, observe more closely the interested candidates and consider them as possible future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students want to be so direct.
"The main point was previously found in technical projects," Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is becoming harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
Unless they have to announce and, above all, to get a highly qualified workmanship.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI for its German stamps), in October there were 40,000 vacant engineers.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this void of engineers will grow even more.
In the audit and consulting company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for talent hunting.
Organise expensive recruitment events, such as KPMG's career, a type of modern yincana, where participants need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the United States next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG's branches and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of election on the exit.
Only the cream cream of many participants goes to the United States.
Universities are increasingly trying to choose and clean up the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple journey by itself was short."
For the Dykta season the notes give results.
"So far we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some people are close to their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach to the campus, they are also hunting, above all, small and medium-sized companies, classic with their work holidays.
"We're trying to get students at specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, who is responsible for the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently 35 vacant posts appear on the company's website.
"It's very complicated to fill out the vacant posts."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is the contact with university teachers.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors advise that practice can be done with us or carry out their thesis.
No advertising campaigns are carried out for solar specialists.
This is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, wool hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium can't usually offer it," says Stübe, the staff officer.
In the search for employment, money is no longer the most important.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, child assistance or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld hosts the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For what the employee asks, I am satisfied with the work and the environment in it and I observe the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff member also expects extra points in his classification by his graduates to work.
"I believe that the applicant is especially fixed in the external classifications of an employer potential," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want a long-term strategy that earns a good reputation as an employer.
Consult your customers for more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer goes through the employees themselves," he assures.
In the hierge of the sector is called Employer Branding internal, also promoting corporate identity within the template itself.
"A satisfied employee is the best ambassadors."
When people are treated well and identify them with the company, they get promotion directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a pandilla game," Kriegler says.
Obama holds new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thus cancelled its previous plans in an unimaginable manner.
There are also new drillings on the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Prior to the tragedy that cost eleven workers their lives and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drillings in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce the dependence of the US on new foreign oil supplies.
To date, it has not been clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the centre of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
The Obama Research Commission will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, raised the perforation moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to discard a new catastrophe by using more stringent controls and more stringent security regulations.
At present, the responsible control authority, which has been charged with corruption charges, has fallen into discredit, is reforming root.
Obama similarly announces that profit-making tax gaps for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that the total extraction in the Gulf will be less thanks to more stringent regulation, so far.
"The government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the results of the current survey carried out by the BDO consulting company - before the ban on the extraction of Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects continue as soon as possible, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil maroon, smells like a gas stationer: Millions of litres thrown from clay have ruined nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live in theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari looks good.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures reporters: "Today there will be enough oil in front of you."
The 37-year-old Nigerian managed to photograph boys walking in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colourful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil stains float on the surface.
Before he took his legs in his fists, he told Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetti River.
In the meantime, the liquid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was thrown into the huge wetlands by a broken tube.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to get to fish-filled waters: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most aggravated regions of the world.
On the way to the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine removes a brown hot, hand in the water, will extract oil filled.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground as dark straws of regaliz, sadly isolate the palm trees that shock and swallow their palm trees.
In the van are searched for bands of birds, as if they were in the wetlands as always: As the barrier from the outside is closed, a species of phantom calm from a previous paradise with a smell of gas.
"What's happening here is an ecological struggle," he said, "orphaned, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
There's a war comparison going on.
The area of settlement of the Ogoni is an overcrowded battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers arrived more than 60 years ago, here was organized the first resistance in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil workers.
To date, the return of companies to Ogoniland is prohibited: While they pumped more than two million black gold barrels daily in the whole region of the delta, of a size three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters highlighted steel platforms such as water sculptures: "Navigation trees" lovingly called the heads of the perforators.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
At every moment a head is missing, Akpobari says, then runs a constant oil rush in the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres have been spent in the Delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the ship's abrasion "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the largest ecological disasters in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the long-term environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell's consortium and oil-organized thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists come to the heads about to break and to pipelines with leaks as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the world conventionals, scientist Richard Steiner blamed the consortium in 2008: Only the failure indices of tubes are "over a multiple than elsewhere".
In a place, which from far away seems forgotten, there appears an oil-filled workshop under the free sky, figures arise from between the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, is a flame of fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil heats up in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, the gas pipeline through the pipelines in the container, later the oil pipeline drops and finally comes out diesel.
Thus, Michael and four employees produce up to four diesel barrels of 300 litres daily: "We bring 34,000 nair", about $22.
The people of the delta take advantage of the lack of fuel in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of only 40 euros per litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", who called the pipeline network that goes through Ogoniland: According to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil per day are lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the temporary raw material stored is clearly illegally refined: organized criminal networks, which also belong to political and high military positions, keep the best part in aljibes and sell it cheap on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate purely academic as to whether the environmental catastrophe is due, rather, to the management of the population or the smooth way of production.
"If the oilers did not act as invaders and did not completely destroy the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
Whereas the conditions of the Ogoni are mainly destroyed by Shell to the point that only a deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to introduce another nationality, such as China."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's about time you're gone," says Muscle Ölmann.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If the special unit of the army takes illegal refiners, do not threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
The soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
"This convicted invention has completely made pieces to our country," Akpobari says.
Researchers detect hazardous factory defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which could produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
The Qantas airline wants to claim the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus who made an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than the one you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities, through their investigations, experienced a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and warned of a possible factory defect.
The potential of the defect has complicated implications: In a connection of manguites, it can be caused by fatigue or cracks, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 aircraft.
Among those who are the Qantas-Airbus who had to make a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline launches legal remedies against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a claim in the Sydney Federal Court that would allow for more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline would claim compensation for the November beginning incident.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is deteriorating.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of petrol as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be recharged.
Australian researchers announced that they would perform more safety tests on the superjubes equipped with affected engines.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesman.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas apparatus, the airline kept its A380 fleet on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three of its 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa retired the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada across the country causes chaos in traffic
Totally white Germany: From one day to another has snowed throughout the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter ice Germany: In almost all of the country there were frozen temperatures during the night of Thursday, which has triggered chaos in traffic in many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer of 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and many streets.
At the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the kitanieves are still operating, removing the new snow again and again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong winds sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects live tides with water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Sajonia, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsische Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partially 30 centimeters of newly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are responsible for rewinding it.
There were many trucks and cars trapped during the night.
In Sajonia Anhalt, police authorities also reported major street riots.
In A2, the snow and the wind paralysed traffic and created crevices.
In Turkey, snows affected A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Sajonia, Sajonia Anhalt, Turingia and northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the fallen trees on the rocks or the damaged chain and the holes are the main problems.
In Sajonia, Leipzig's interurban service is suspended in Nuremberg.
In Safield, Turingia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
The bombers and the rescue service served the 165 passengers on the train with coats of wool, food and drink.
The snow winds sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snow winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesperson for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a spokesman for Fraport.
The kitanieves are still in operation.
However, there are few passengers walking at the airport, although there are 400 campaign beds prepared for them.
In many streets, there were many accidents on Wednesday afternoon.
In the afternoon a truckman died in a collision with a train on a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The engineer suffered mild injuries.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg because of the snowy streets: Here too a truck was reached on a road crossing because the vehicle was locked.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, Bayreuth's trip to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after taking a van with her car near Aschapenburg on a highway.
Meteorologists have good news: the snow will become softer and dustier and will therefore be cooler.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
No doubt it will continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 negative degrees.
Godche Bank seeks a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers in its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to EUR 500 million.
Deutschen Bank recently set up its headquarters: the twin towers were modernised in the area of the Frankfurt banks; while the bankers returned to their old jobs.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of the reunification, and seek a buyer for the two rackets, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" states, based on a spokesperson.
The spokesperson does not appoint the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own or sell the properties and then rent them again," he said.
That is why Germany's largest credit institution renouncing its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired twin towers in mid-2007 by EUR 272 million from the investor in a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms have reached some EUR 200 million.
A sale would be a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area calculate the value of the tower of the newspaper named "Greenovers" at around EUR 500 million.
If the newly refurbished buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor, the speaker said.
Thousands of mourners for the deceased
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of buried miners, who were killed after many explosions in a mine.
However, corpses have not been found, because security measures remain precarious in place of disaster.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion in the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A survey was introduced at the site of the disaster, but no sign of survival was found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue equipment could be lowered for safety reasons.
After the second intensive detonation, the authorities and experts found that there was no possibility that the miners would have survived.
The bodies could not be recovered to date.
Family and friends now remind the deceased of a memorial act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the bright sunlight in Greymouth in the New Zealand South Island.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, under clothes and surfboards.
The flags flowed in half even in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would return to the surface of "the depths of the earth," John Key, president of the New Zealand government, told the participants of the commemorative act.
"But they never came home."
He cannot take the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the victims' families, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative act.
In the first explosion on 19 November, mines of British and South African origin were also buried.
The rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the island of the South of New Zealand.
As soon as explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasive temperatures inside the mine will begin to descend, Gary Knowles, the police chief, told reporters.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the gore fit in the artistic film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn once again explores the boundaries of the gender with his epic battles "Wallala Rising".
What audience would the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought about when he was rolling "Wallala Rising"?
A Viking warrior trapped with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his torturers and assassinated his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and kill his enemies with the triples of his bodies alive when he's in bad humour.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, does not say almost any word throughout the film and the other characters are allowed to carry as much as one or two sentences or a couple of painful mortal screams.
On the contrary, they remain silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland, which the builders offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Better ideal for grown and interested cinematists in existentialism and in very calm camera movements.
When a movie has several groups of recipients, it is a shame that it cannot be discarded.
Director Winding Refn considers his wildlings and trilogy about the "Pusher" drug dealer's penis as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he is Stotically refusing to make his works be for all the public with something more humour in the main stream or something less brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and threeps that explode cannot deter most of the artistic cinema's followers.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a group of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and an eternity is stuck in calm and fog before his team gets to America and goes back to quiet there.
It's a shame "Wallala Rising" hasn't found a cinematographic distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a disaster against the magnificent images, but also because, after the supposed and bloodthirsty made, a piece of film is hidden sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a febrile dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is awarded only a moment of relaxation and its glacial images and the dull sound band of trance make him a nude in his throat, especially the incredible hatred, which goes from the hearts of characters to him.
Only a young ruby, who loyally supports Unojo, preserves something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for temporary enemies and allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
It represents loss, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Wallala Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, change and be surprised.
An experience.
The Mystery of Earth’s Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this subject until controls are allowed.
On the middle of the night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli combat planes F-15 I attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the coast of Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cave, hidden in a valley that comes out of the river.
According to information from the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the very suitable proximity of El Kibar for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are built.
Instead, the technique only serves other purposes than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
It was not long ago that the reactor was in operation, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is only more known that by then, the enigmas became bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that prior to the CIA attack he was absolutely sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but that he saw only indications that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "pleasable".
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When he was asked how certain he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat answered in summer in a stone way that the IAEA had "sufficient material to have questions".
The Syrians quickly rid themselves of the ruins of the supposed "unused military building" and spread the land to consciousness.
In June 2008, however, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium traces in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images about a Member State, from traders at the moment immediately after the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always understood that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as inversible after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this, as well as the satellite images.
In addition, drivers are prohibited from having a second inspection in the Kibar and entering the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not resulted since June 2008 and "has progressively become a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a Western high-ranking diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons is pending, as the IAEA notes.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
Inspectors have not made public until the time the teams are dealt with, or what functions they have, or if they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandarayah as an internal entity, again derived from the proximity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is very likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or next to a military base, Syria for this reason prohibits the entry into the IAEA of the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the United States has requested the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment due to warnings from the U.S. secret service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is transferred between the three places and the cube on the coast of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high position in Vienna said that at least one of the teams can be "related to fuel production".
But there is no "significance of sensitive activities", nor of uranium enrichment or re-conditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor acts with uranium that is not enriched.
Where should the uranium come from and where should the plutonium be subsequently separated for the bombs, for these central questions there are, in the best case, plausible assumptions.
There is no doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are located in the three places.
As hundreds of trucks on the ground disappeared, no one has information about where the garbage remains.
The IAEA considers it unlikely that the al-Tibni salt mine, located within the few kilometres from the Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, was recognized by the Syrians in 1998 by their capacity as a radioactive waste area.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, related it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspected locations and removed large containers after IAEA requested entry.
It can be a coincidence but it only helps to dissipate the suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has employed a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which would allow Syrians to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors' interest.
In the meantime, Damascus also criticises this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago calmed down that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months ago, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, is holding out so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Vienna nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amman, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still vacillates.
This route is very risky: most of the IAEA's governance board is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for a climb.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: "And what if they finally find nothing?"
Love in the Times of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the address of her debut yet nameless.
She herself has written the script, a story of love between a Bosnian and a Serb.
We don't know much more about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman is in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's associations have protested quickly, with which they recently moved some days of rotation planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner for UNHCR by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie was the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
It was not diplomatic, the women offered him a meeting in Hungary several weeks ago that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
No love stories are given in the fields of rape, and Jolie's position in this regard delates the victims enough about the script.
Its organization, in accordance with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended that Jolie be removed as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, gave a shot and a permission to write in Sarajevo is not quite clear because Jolie was not there at all.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, that she is very much involved in the Yugoslav conflict, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
Its contents are still unclear.
On the network is a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and once again meet when she, a Muslim Bosniak, is deported to a Serbian field in which he works as a guard.
What sounds quite different is the "victim of rape is in love with torture".
It's certain that Jolie's film really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "injust and based on wrong information".
Currently, they can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script continues on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like away from here.
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish.
No Trace of Affliction
On the other hand, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy as the music breaks down, they hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey Club vibrates in the Southern Cork, because the players launch, and find, pingpong balls to beer cups from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this estrafical drink game and the computer discretion really don't make good jokes.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, to get distracted by the overwhelming question, what will happen to him in the future.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"He's far away from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: Your girlfriend is waiting for you in Auckland, "from a shot you got the work of your dreams as event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of the three Tanners brothers have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as a IT consultant in London.
Young people go: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, predicting the economic experts and the social research institute ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015 there are 200,000 immigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts confirm, a similar migratory wave that the island suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that brought great well-being to Irish people, melancholy is now expanding.
The economic crisis mainly confuses young, well-trained Irish people, for whom so far everything is at stake.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under thirty years of age are on the stand.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young immigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
"There should be an upsurge against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, goes and loses our country and with that to an entire generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a dark future because the government is only dedicated to mountings and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they don't have strategies to achieve new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
Notice how your colleagues are dealing with practices that are not remunerated to the following.
His greatest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnnon are trying to see this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who start working abroad, doing so is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to guide your career," said the manager.
On your website are photos of a boy practicing surfing in Australia and others practicing snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in galleries, unless it brings freedom and fun.
Since half a year ago, Seán O'Donovan has known how to build something elsewhere.
Since there was no longer anything to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish partners in construction in Germany.
Now they raise a fashion shop in Gelsenkirchen.
He's going to Hanover or Berlin in January, the next project.
O'Donavan sees his country only a few times because he works extra hours to be able to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as it was a long time ago when he walked the shadow of his house.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs at something shameful and goes to cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with garden care in front of the houses, large and expensive cars are parked at the entrance.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid to fail with the credit?
O'Donavan thinks for a while, serves hotter tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears at present.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe that makes us feel Irish for the first time."
He laughed and said about his father, who went to England in the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Let the future hang and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's been working for a couple of years in London, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend go well in New Zealand?
But in these days there is something that worries you about overcoming: the celebration of your 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
I'm afraid I can degenerate at a farewell party.
"Only, not too much emotion," she says, and gives a big deal to her beer.
"Excuse me, it sounds very distressing."
"We'd better call it a go party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private companies.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it enables monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year's survey, carried out in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively animated humour ruling in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes to democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent a year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
He also grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a great decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
Around 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but significantly higher than 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Graph 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but significantly higher in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries have only been affected by a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin American people living in poverty was only marginally increased in 2009 and that it has been reduced again this year, up to 32 per cent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, the most surveyed in Latin America mention crime, instead of unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Figure 5).
About 31 per cent claims that either they or a close relative have been the victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has been reduced since 38 per cent of last year and that it is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in greater support for private enterprises and the market economy: about 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while only 56 per cent in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Around 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow its country to develop, compared with 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of the respondents in Venezuela feel the same way (and 80% support private companies), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country that exercises greater leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by the surveyed in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went far worse than the fear of foreigners who were trying to help the country recover from their problems.
Voting was introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, ballots fired in the alcantarillas, destroyed electoral colleges and intimidation acts.
The electoral colleges opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, were wandering around the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, were defeated.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, complained of fraud and asked for the election to be cancelled.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior official of the United Nations in Haiti, stated that they were "a relatively good election in many ways."
The observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said with caution that "we do not think that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which, according to its competitors, is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The discharge is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes for elections have yet been lost.
The two main candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request in which they requested the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who only has support, if he has something, has gone to the second round.
In view of the country's cholera epidemic and more than one million earthquake survivors continue to live in shops, a great deal is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed to do so because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity papers, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the choice of a popular and legitimate government to be an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, according to the patent, the Haitians themselves think so too.
Moving dots towards the center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity index by 20 points, up to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Despite all this, which can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in the coming year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who was still in charge of economic policy even after his wife had succeeded him as president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax income, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernández's government lost most of her in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened since Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some disconcerting members of the Peronist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after a chaotic session in which a Member gave a punch to each other and other Members accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore be applied next year, which will offer the President an even greater margin of action when it is spent.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1 per cent, but numerous private calculations, in addition to trade unions' salary requirements, are about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made poverty growth and poverty reduction its priorities rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and made the Indec, the Institute of Statistics, adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández see these policies now?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, their officials say they want to limit wage increases to 18 per cent a year.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum for growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps it's because Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with the bond holders who had been denied a strong prior restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not subscribed in 2001.
At present, Mrs. Fernández appears to be about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped at the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6,700 million.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve the supervision of the IMF, as usual.
Last month, however, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economic Affairs, announced that the Fund would offer "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for national consumption, which seems to prelude to the cleaning of INDIC.
It is unclear whether President Fernández wants to continue politics when his mandate is over, given that he no longer has his husband beside him.
If you do, you will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has become tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacations in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, calmly, many of your husband’s policies.
Average swearing by China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about his big brother on the other side of the line?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the voters, came on 27 November to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a defender of the continent's feelings, forming innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest changes in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but slowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five elections to the mayor, it failed to obtain the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has leaned towards full independence from Taiwan, obtained almost 50 per cent of all votes against 45 per cent of KMT.
If it were the Presidents, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party has decreased by about 8 per cent.
For the first time, the PPD stuck with KMT in the towns.
The elections saw the typical elements of Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with dancing flags and light girls.
Nor did the mysterious attempted rigor murder fail.
Sean Lien, Lien Chan's son, honorary president of KMT, was campaigning for one of KMT's candidates the night before the elections.
A man of the crowd shot the young man directly to his face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Interestingly, it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or avenge himself from the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean on the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that it was not the issue of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat of China.
Therefore, KMT often avoids advertising its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging the feeling against China.
Responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma said that it had been confirmed that his China policy was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to ensure that Taiwan returns to the rule.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly like to have political integration as well, but the first is the first.
It is best to expect the 2012 presidential elections to pass.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned for corruption.
The President between 2000 and 2008 openly called for explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is trying to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been gratefully welcomed as a candidate for the PPD for the presidency, as did Her Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything possible to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced the plans for the establishment of an expert group that acts as a contact point between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be conducted without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the candidates of the PPD had been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to present himself to the presidents.
Even without the intervention of Mr Chen, the PPD will have difficulty choosing from among its potential candidates.
KMT should also carry out a consciousness review.
Mr Ma's assessments have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; KMT's candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between the rich and the poor.
A spokesman for KMT says he will restructure his office as well as local teams.
The large samples of the PPD suggest that Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprising choice in the category of artist revelation.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will be fixed in you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz player and singer personally selected by President Obama to play at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the surprises of Grammys this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Given that Spalding has been a hailed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Experience", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the rules of Grammys according to which he must be an artist who has not taken out more than three albums before recording what "determines the public identity of that artist".
Its ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly made great progress and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop influences, funk and Latin rhythms, can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the way to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy's voters, who have recently concentrated in the field of jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "History", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is the veteran saxophoneist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and the technologist John Beasley by "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite stripper in New Orleans and a typical guest in the HBO's "Treme", was honored in the category of contemporary jazz, which for the rest tends considerably towards fusion as in Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society's wild punk won a deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against Billy Children's Assembly's great camera jazz and the always risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the democratic leadership of the basilica in his band.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classical albums
The nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey by "Dreamhouse", a work for three-moved eclectic orchestra.
Among the nominees with links to southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a play commissioned by the Philharmonic of Los Angeles and starred at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also appointed by his Mandolin Concerto.
Classic music nominations are distributed into thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, coral and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominations: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner by the Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and "Requiem" by the Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg by "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and choir of the Marinesky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers appointed to a Grammy by contemporary compositions include Pärt by Symphony No. 4, Daugherty by "God Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze by "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg by "Graffiti" and Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's 4th Symphony broke out in Disney Hall in January 2009 at a meeting recorded by the Philharmonic of Los Angeles, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, approximately 30 minutes away, is "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former magnate of Mikhail Khodorkovsky oil, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is appointed by the instrumental soloist performance with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically to touch it in Mandolin Avi Avital, who interpreted the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"The composition with Middle East sounds and numerous scales and rhythms of North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was appointed to the orchestra function category, leading the Chicago Symphonic Orchestra during a recording of works by Stravinsky.
Among the appointed instrumental soloists are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sophie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic blend category, Soprano Jesse Norman was named for his recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains the approval of the Management Committee
The project of mosque for Temecula has received unanimous support from the local management committee after more than five hours of public witnessing, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it fosters terrorism and confidence.
However, the members of the committee decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre would respect local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Bahais, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic centre of the Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loud."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who intervened in favour or against the centre, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the website of the newspaper.
"The United States no longer exists", read in one of the comments.
"It's another Planet of Seeds with Mrs. Libertad dead in the arena."
"America has fallen."
The construction plans of Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011 took place.
In the Temecula Valley, the imman Mahmoud Harmoush has reported acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living safely in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse he rented in a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square feet mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two mines and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres in Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
The opponents can still refer the project to the municipal Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and, possibly, on other planets.
Although researchers have discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it proves that life forms can be found without the main elements that they considered essential.
"This organism has a dual capacity."
"It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic."
"It turns it into something very peculiar, although little is needed to be a kind of life really 'alienigena'," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of Thursday's publication Science.
For a long time, there have been considered six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing the phosphorus by arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what's possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, finding is important for looking for life on different planets on Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it has.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press wheel to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated a great speculation on the Internet on the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there might be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," commented Charles Cockell, cathedral of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is innovative because it demonstrates the substitution of one element by another in basic biochemical and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not carried out by accident.
Happy Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrobiology, which conducted the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, it may be difficult for the agencies to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is quite different than so that it does not work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, in some way, appeals to biochemical machinery," Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing arsenic concentrations, which they managed to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that it can naturally exist a form of life that uses arsenic, either in other parts of the earth or in another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, pointed out that the idea of replacing arsenic by phosphorus is not new, but an example has never been found to prove that it works.
The arsenic was more common in the early ages of the Earth, he pointed out, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life could have used it.
"Yes, it suggests that there might be other ways of generating life, not only the way life was formed on Earth in ancient times," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The stolen dogs that were missing in Compton have been found
The two dogs that were missing from the four stolen in front of the Bellflower motel were found, according to the officers of the Sheriff of the Los Angeles County on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Corgi gales Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in 2006 in which they were spending the night, in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, as the authorities pointed out.
Two of the canines were recovered in the afternoon and the two others were found in the afternoon, late at night, as Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson of the sheriff's department in the county of Los Angeles, reported.
"The good news is that dogs are well," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They're back with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"A study is being carried out."
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some clues."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to make any comments on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had no damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to display in the competitions in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, continued to disappear until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and were planning to show Trace.
The other dogs were going to show them in other competitions scheduled for the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba Championship, as Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops on the nearly two-month tour that the couple takes part in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked-in at the motel.
Usually they stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of your room.
They carried three other dogs (a boxing creature, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left Akitas and Corgis in the van because they had a very thick coat and would be fresher.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was not clear whether or not a reward would be given.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM achieves the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light to start again.
On Thursday, a New York Federal Bankruptcy Judge officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to erase approximately $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year entertainment company to focus on its efforts in the production and production of films and television programmes.
The Thursday's failure confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to be relaunched under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned credit instrument of $500 million to finance operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management needed to manage their finances, while struggling to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former president of Enron and expert in the recovery of companies in bankruptcy, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy the more than 140 study creditors required much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009, the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few posters and no willingness to pay the more than $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
Before spring this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally supported by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially exits the bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-billionaire bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive $9.5 million.
Cooper companies, which have been collecting $375.000 a month for their company management services, will receive a "successful fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production in MGM, which only shot a movie this year, and gathered an annual pizza of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The study needs a separate loan of $265 to $275 million to finance its part of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance of his gift budget
While iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by perhaps the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant apple in your gift budget.
Consider that at the price of an iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings decorated with accounts, or approximately 48 lats of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to maintain your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy salesmen, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy at less than $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Act has been working; this year's technological toy is likely to have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most famous of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button-driven toys are increasing, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" You, unless otherwise indicated).
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are ball toys of the size of a cock who sing a note when their guts are pressed.
A pendulum is equal to a note, and a second pendulum begins to build a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
For combined dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking advantage of Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-inch animonic doll plays turn shift games like Simóm Dice, and can take the lunar step, thanks to its innovative feet tied with wheels with locking device.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a bag full of letters of questions designed to turn a car ride into a session with a set of current self-correction exercises.
If you are afraid to give your child your smart phone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60, 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leafster Explorer ($70, 3 to 12 years), is the first important point of the Leafster line, with a new and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, 3-7 years old) uses an iTunes-type system to present games and electronic books, and has a SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a five-block game just bigger than a lock box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to arm words by putting the blocks in line before time ends; it is formidable for an improvised competition of armed words.
They are increasingly the toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on its presence in toys, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, from 6 to 12 years old), which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you change the online code, your child gets enough credit in the Penguin Club store for two items.
These could include wheel pads or a Puffle pet toy.
A little bigger than the pig's toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last on a microbot line driven by button stacks.
The false insect moves rapidly over 12 silicone legs that vibrate, in random directions.
It's fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of order maintenance is promoted in China
As a sergeant urban instructor, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted female members to come along, the corrupt police officers of the Chinese urban order, afraid and despised by their capricious energetic measures and their tendency to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Signs!"
"Look out!"
Show them, he smiled, "How beautiful girls are!"
Four girls who just spent adolescence with white gloves and olive green jackets identical and adjusted pants to call attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed above the hair tied with blue and white rays.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, contemptuously.
"Models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clear the image of Chinese city inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the gray green color of the uniforms to a so-called more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force by intimidation: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a truck of snacks, and observed it with the constantly milled ashes for half an hour, until the traveling salesman picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, specifically elected by its appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the police men a softer side, female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's minimal respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to comply with city orders, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, the Inspectors of Hubei Province killed a passerby after using their cell phone to film them while disbanding a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, where it described how to effectively beat criminals without bleeding them.
This year, a runaway sandwich salesman in Shanghai suffered brain damage after a five-official queen.
A video game full of violence, available for download online, presents inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street vendors.
"Chenguan has left a scar in the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after another discussion about tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really methic cleaning".
The skeptics say that the current approach is far from this.
After the district applied for eight new female recruits through a notice in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News was asked whether women had real duties or were simply a staged distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's notice asked for female candidates from 18 to 22 years of age, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They should have a height above average, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said that work was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
"Your image is the important thing," said an anonymous district official to Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and inner qualities".
They are like flowering women, he said, and added, "Being flowering, they will have other responsibilities".
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to support this description.
But he observed that the height requirements were standard in many Chinese work notices for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement of harmonious facial features.
If this means bet, it is a matter of debate between the Chinese.
Of course, the less-valid or defigured must not be presented.
"We cannot allow a man or a thief to come to work here," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be fine."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang Plaza near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colorful cheeks and a subtlely curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent in her aspect is sexist, she said.
"You think I look sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a Sardinian look.
His 21-year-old workmate, Xu Yang, said "Our work must present the image of the city".
They also do not oppose their work at a certain time, they said, because they are more ambitious than just putting salesmen on the streets where they are supposed to surround their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more than a dozen traveling salesmen who are thrown on foot or on a bicycle, trying to sell as many tofu panes or tazones as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily leaving his car fired by a bicycle with fides.
Officials describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausters.
"This is more or less the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20 years old, who is studying marketing in his spare hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the salesmen's merchandise.
They can only threaten by denouncing the offenders to their supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan's provincial capital, were upset after spreading the false rumor that some officers had murdered a salesman.
More than a dozen police officers or officers were injured in the night sky; 14 government vehicles were thrown into or caught in fire.
For the time being Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is only guaranteed.
Only two streets from the peaceful Plaza Baoguang, where female officers patrold that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the steel instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike was screaming grossly.
The situation took place for 15 minutes before officers, with a bad face, opened up to the cods to their vehicles and were quickly with the motorcycle and their owners.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white insignia returned to hide his name.
As female officials, the coordinators, 40-year-olds or more, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total nature.
"Most of the time is the public who starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that the prosecutors of the Department of Justice have excused Senator John Ensign from the criminal allegations that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through the lobby for the wife's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his business had national title last year and damaged his career.
The Ensign office said it felt "surely happy" for the decision, which came after an investigation of an entire year.
The senator could still face a disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign lawyers said that the Department of Justice had informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plans to raise charges against him on this issue.
The Department of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have been involved in violating a federal crime ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first released in October 2009 at the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative job through lobbying to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the Senator's business with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as the treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign was contacted with several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton's job and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, he was excluded under the law of lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, which were intimate friends before the deal, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving by lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict the use of former state employees to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolutionary door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the Department of Justice officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department appeared cautious in accepting political proceedings after several important revisions for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon the trial against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of misdemeanour of procedure.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of defenses that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, chief attorney at Ensign, said in an interview that he received a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday and another call the following day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
The Ensign defence team had been cooperating with the prosecutors in trying to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable entering into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separate from the ethics group, claiming that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was only a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had been supporting the senator for a long time, which got work through lobby thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign cabinet chief John Lopez contacted Hampton and told him that he was "masking" the Ministry of the Interior on a controversial issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to do lobbying.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters that he planned to post a third mandate in the Senate.
When Ensign's voice, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude its investigation.
"The Senator Ensign wishes to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chattering" in the rows of the courtroom.
One minute, they sent reports of the terrible testimony via Twitter.
In the end, says the defense, there were over 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that approached the rape and children attached to their beds in a house that was caught fire.
On Thursday, the trial largely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to arrive at an official end, with the imposition of the death penalty by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have submitted written submissions to the court that outline the arguments of the appeals that will likely occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by media journalists, created "a Circumstance", and such widespread and immediate saturation with elevated details made public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could oblige the appeals judges to deal with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief defense lawyer Mr Hayes.
The judge of the first instance Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Court, laconically rejected the claims in a case last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been led by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the courts of appeal have acknowledged that coverage of celebrity cases can generate questions about the impartiality of a trial.
In a historic case in 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the conviction of a osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television program and the film "The Escaper".
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeals that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be necessary to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media" in high profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of Stanford Law School, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report saying that it was imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make the trials more just.
The question of Twitter is just one of many of the topics outlined by Hayes lawyers, who will probably be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes might have been injured when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jury members, showing them speculative photographs of the crime scene during the jury selection.
Some jury members have said they were terrified by the victims' photographs, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and their daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela 11.
Defence lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wrongly removed a jury that had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had wrongly pressured a verdict on a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to decide for a week.
The jury was not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a refusal to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media constantly threw wood at the fire of emotion on the case.
"The daily accumulation of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," lawyers said, "was something never seen here in New Haven and maybe all over the state."
Your attention on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly was a contentious vision that would make the court ' s policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
However, some lawyers said that the courts of appeal often felt drawn by the arguments on the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes lawyers are pressuring for that claim.
In his letter, he referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which revokes Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the trial's coverage, and made it clear that they would require new media to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the twenty-first century."
Can the citizen tend a bridge to join the divisions?
After a notable campaign of invectiveness and negativity, a bit of civilism has been triggered this week in Washington.
Is it a presage of genuine future bilateral cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to the partyist struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders made no progress on the major issues to be addressed during the upcoming meeting.
But what they all say was at least a brief discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to win party points.
The public meeting of the President's deficit committee on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that close interaction for a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological break that still separates members.
That is only enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both parties are in a trial period, searching for each other to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed party war.
The reason why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent evaluations by the participants were made with minimum demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are very deeply rooted as to suggest any rapid change in the climate that has existed over the last two years.
Whether it is taxes, expenditures, health care or social assistance, both parties are at odds.
In any case, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to how to say things," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Public Ethics and Policy Centre.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse party passions, which then fade away.
That's good."
In some matters, particularly those on the agenda of the upcoming meeting, Republicans and Democrats have no option but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are won at the end of the year, and nobody's in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, it is likely that there is a commitment to increase unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans cannot believe that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, refusing unemployment benefit for the unemployed.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the upcoming meeting, together with the ratification of the new Nuclear Disarmament Pact START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institute warns that successful cooperation in the pressing issues of the upcoming meeting will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement would begin.
"After things have been done, short-term psychology will reverse the situation to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that the citizen can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a trial for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the formation of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who have made a decisive contribution to its creation.
With more awareness that the Republican leaders have the dangers of overstepping their position, they know that they must try to fulfill their promises to cut state spending and cancel the new health law.
These partnership lines are already clearly observed in initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and retirement age, and the cost cut.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken care of one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have put the issue of the deficit into the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officials elected in the panel, suggesting that there are at least few bases or desire for commitment in tax matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of party shocks, when Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of greater bilateral cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanism of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a dead point, as happened in 1995, then both parties will closely observe the reaction of people.
Anyone who considers that he is losing will probably change course and seek commitment.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
Partisanism and polarization are now larger than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common points on issues that still divide them.
A U.S. filtered document depicts Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "cleptocracy", and leaves some of the bribes and protection money directly to Kremlin, as the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate business but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority", takes part as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyle, was published by WikiLeaks on his website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and he was guilty of much of corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of cleaning since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically denied corruption charges over the years, and he has won several verbal claims on such charges.
In September, when a Russian television channel was asked about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, it's a pattern, it's a boredom."
According to the surveys, the Russians believe in an overwhelming way that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the Embassy report, and it is unusual for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
"The direct slaves of the Moscow City Government with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to say that the government works more like a cleptocracy than a government," the note states.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means 'techo' or protection) that crosses the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow government's bureaucracy.
"Analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is the highest."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects the money from larger companies, and that the police point to small businesses.
One source, said the report, "explained that Moscow's commercial owners understand that the best thing is to achieve the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that, while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed by a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The note from the embassy informs about men taking bags, probably full of cash, within the same Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats," said George Satarov, director of the Indem group of experts in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no more a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified as 154 (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy's note, which did not happen until late at night in Moscow, will surely cause discontent within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for Kremlin's argument that is solving the problem.
Interviewed with CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously by a revelation that claimed that US diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way."
Veterans of the Red Jemeres forced to face the past
In a particular classroom that was slightly illuminated, with walls painted and discolored, the principal of the Second School Anlong Veng reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemeres Ta Mok.
"This is where everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and was concerned about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Carnicero" because of its brutality during the Red Jemeres government, the commander is still popular in this remote ex fort of the Red Jemeres in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemeres surrender to the government, the long-lasting loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation enabled victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a textbook of secondary school which for the first time teaches the story of the Red Jemeres to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations-Cambodia Joint Court issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Jemeres, judging the former head of the known Tuol Slang torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, best known as Duch, at 35 years of imprisonment.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Jemeres of Anlong Veng, complicated efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemeres was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the Government of the Red Jemeres of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and defeated the government led by Pol Pot, the rest of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that was surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the war of guerrillas from their bases in the mountains and forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemeres fighters began to desert the government, culminating in Ieng Sary's returns in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of its benefactors, the oldest Red Jemers fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although few Red Jemeres elite officials have retained their local administrative positions instead of depositing their weapons, racial soldiers remain poor and unqualified farmers.
"These people have gained little benefit after surrender," Sok Lang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation said, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept of business."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemeres when she was a teenager in 1974, fought in the forest near Anlong Veng before being dedicated to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemeres was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave her all the food."
"But now life is hard because we have to self-abstain."
The current Red Sea Court has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, it is expected that the court will begin trialing Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Red Jemeres minister.
The mandate of the court is to prosecute the main leaders and those with greater responsibility for the crimes, but it has not stated whether or not it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This wasn't much used to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Red Jemeres in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had monitored the construction of Trapeang Thma's dam, a project that was thought to have killed thousands of forced workers.
During a recent rainy afternoon, Im Chaem again worked in the fields at his home on wooden pilots on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun dropped long shadows on the dry past, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeres.
She said that if the court called her up, she would not be presented.
"Cambodia is in peace and stability," he said.
"If there are more processings, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Red Jemeres in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court prosecutes more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to move forward, Chhang Youk said, from the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first text book approved by the government on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the book of history of secondary school history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemeres.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little details about the Red Jemeres, despite the city's link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng Secondary School, said that the new text book helped students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the text book and the court," he said.
"They have doubts because they are not sure about the number of people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the text book and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemeres preserves a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many bad grasses and covered with waste plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black Hollin covered by an oxidized roof of hojalate.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tires after its death in 1998.
Noum Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile salesman at the edge of the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to pray to him," he said.
It was the birthday of Noum Sothea, and later that day he decided to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas with the hope of having good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its qualified uranium reserve for weapons
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material all over the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it would give up its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement issued after the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, in addition to a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point without returning last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of uranium qualified for the arms of a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday's agreement to withdraw the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to one official, who spoke from the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the 47 nations chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement was "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide in Prague over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to rid themselves of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had stated that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved the highly enriched uranium ( hundreds of kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for armament) and the low-rich uranium," Lukashenko said at that time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating an interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said that the first task of withdrawing the uranium from Belarus was particularly complicated in October, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to the officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was made by plane.
The US government spent $13 million on tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with low-enrichment uranium research, which was not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working in the Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence" which led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of qualified uranium for weapons, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reservation by 2012, according to the joint declaration.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to the harsh repression of human rights by Lukashenko.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a potential distance.
It was stated that "As long as progress is welcomed in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the country's progress and its citizens".
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda headed for Guantanamo by Spanish territory, as the US ambassador to Madrid said on a telegram.
This is reflected in the document filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that then the government's first vice-president, Maria Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were exercising appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe in which he accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguire and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken Zapatero's Government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"From the Vega he stressed that Spain does not have any repairs to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "disappeared pills," says Aguirre in a cable.
The then Foreigner, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "would like to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, in the hands of judges, the Government had limited power to influence".
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge's initiative to request the disclassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any criminal elements or sensitive information," the Ambassador explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the United States reflected its concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than the classified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manage the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 at lunch between the US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he said that "although the Spanish judges are furiously jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of rhetorical inflammation in an attempt to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US Government," he said.
The parish confesses complained about the "agobia" network of being a mother
The young woman was talking about the child when she was already dead and had a blog: "Terrorism in the Galega"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which he used as a child, he communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natures of Noah, the Crown people from which she originated.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, you need to know your sentimental life, which ABC rebuilds through the testimony of its relatives.
The 30-year-old Galega began a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Tunez, an industrialist.
It took a year.
When they left him, she was soon supposed to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him test DNA.
It didn't take him long to meet another boyfriend.
The elected was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
With him he came to live for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to investigate the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even went with her to Palma for a week.
But because of the content of the communications, it is seen that his novel was broken, that they broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and musked, because I have come to work."
"When I said it seemed good to him, but of course, now he realizes what it is to be with the child all day long and not have freedom to do what he wants."
Then talk about a message to the phone you just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me a address to send you to the child."
She complains, "If she doesn't like me leaving the cricket with my mother, I'll pick it up when she comes back," she claims.
In May, he spoke of returning to his people: "This week I am going to go there, but I will only be until the 19th, because the 20th I have to present myself to a job not to lose it."
Clearly, if everything's okay with him, he'll take his firstborn.
"He will be with whom he must, that is, with me, and never in his life will it happen to me again with no one other than my mother," dubious intention given his bad relationship.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on 1st of that month, was allegedly murdered on 10, is dead.
"Cesar is happy on one side, but not on the other."
"He's with me on one side and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other side he's going to class almost every day."
Talk about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He will go there (the child) to some summer classes, and thus save me some pasta from the kangaroo."
On 17, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Say Alberto that sent you I don't know what videos to email, look how you want to find me, you gotta fuck."
On 30th, another: "The boy is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's making me money."
On the Internet there are your messages on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now involved, where he was called "Muki the excarclerator."
"Terrorism in the gallega (epigraph)."
The last man who lived with her, keeps an oath, declares her grief for feeling guilty.
You don't want to believe everything happened because you didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the centre of judicial detention in Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "has not intended to cause any harm to the minor".
Earlier, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his corpse in a bag.
The defence and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
Populars would win 4 seats in Congress and PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and Members experienced in recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has a general view as, whether or not it has progressed, prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes that this training receives in those committees is often doubled to what it receives in Catalan.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomouss, the figure rose to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384,091 votes.
To maintain this upward trend, which has been fuelled by a transfer of PSC votes and the faithfulness of the PP electorate, analysts of this training have calculated that if general elections were held, the PSC could move from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now 10) and PSC would lose nothing less than 9 (at 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a Member - now he has three - while ICV would stay with a Member or win one.
But to maintain the electoral calendar, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal commissions, where populars can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their prominence in front of the Barcelona Parliament, one of the most budgeted administrations - EUR 661 million for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and populars coincide with the possibility that the PSC loses the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be possible for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistency - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they are able to make a leading role in the tarraconese capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has located only 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they have met on several occasions.
Populars have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the highest number of populations.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona formed a Yihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaida, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the last of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Kampai operation" the Al Qaida falsification apparatus has been "weaked" at the international level and, "so, its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they have been falsified and then distributed to groups that form the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that their "combatants" can cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The disarmed cell is not the only one that the Yihadist network had operational in Europe, so that in addition to Thai services, other European police units were involved in the investigations, so it is not rejected that in EU territory there will be similar strikes in the coming days as developed last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Ashhar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another development took place in Thailand with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeesan Ehsan Butt and Thai Siriklaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who led the cell from Bangkok to Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists who met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents should be on behalf of men aged 25 to 45 with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
In the middle of the investigation it is emphasized that, at the moment, no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, some $1,000 were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that were "inverted" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended the lives of 106 people.
The Police have been entrusted with extensive documentation.
PP requires Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Arthur But his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and ignoring the Philo-Soberian adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to stage in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans approached Arthur But with the assurance that he had obtained 18 MPs in the last Sunday's elections, he was more than enough to make himself want, as the candidate of the U.S. needs at least one of the formations that the opposition will have to abstain from the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to keep in Congress when general elections are held, but, at the moment, the conversations they hold these days but with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment "will have to park all sovereign and independent speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergence leader even intends to submit to referendum.
Both leaders are in common with their bets on a very inflamed self-government's political device and the elimination of inheritance tax and donations.
The details of the negotiations on the investment of Mas will be taken up by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Catal Solidarity).
The healer claims that the deaths were not "failure of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot don't forget that his cell phone killed more than 11 elders
The leaders of the healer La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press call to highlight the damage the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elders while employed there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared with the lawyer of the centre, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to carry out the charge against the responsible" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility compel us to assume the procedural situation of civil liability".
In addition to the social disgrace that the entity may suffer because it has not detected in time the criminal activities of the cell, the great threat to Caritat now incurs a substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims ' families are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime is going back to August 2009 and that she has not stopped killing ever since.
The judge had already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old patients of the geriatrics - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased, but that, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the treatment was sent by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, rejected this extreme yesterday roundly and pointed out that "the lack of measures could not at any time have been the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no indication in this case that there has been an unwise action by any other person who is not the defendant himself".
He was already baptized as "Angel de la Morte" and confessed 11 murders earlier and detailed that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 to kill a second grandmother, a month and a half later.
In this case, he caused death by injecting an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he committed by using a mixture of sedative pills.
The Director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that centre staff have access to medicines.
The insulin stains and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his affluence to relieve the suffering of the internals, used to kill them.
But it will be the analysis that is being carried out in the laboratory that should clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, she hugged them inside by giving them as she has already confessed that she did with the three women who killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the cellist, nor even to the number of confessed murders, which do not dismiss it as superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in her visits to the judge and in the little sense that she has to change her way of doing after she has successfully committed eight murders.
That is why it is said that justice is made available to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB's threat
The investors suddenly responded yesterday to the Trichet threat yesterday that warned "markets should not underestimate our response capacity".
Peripheral differentials have been strongly closed and the shares of the European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has only responded which is a worrying signal.
What has happened yesterday is itself from an illegal market that, just as it explodes, it recovers but is motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will delay the loss of fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years and those remaining.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan for ineffective and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in time and leaving only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least by June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, that God is watching us!
Just as in their May meeting, in which they claimed that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and had collapsed the markets, tomorrow the story could be repeated.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the basuka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market explosion.
Yesterday's letter auction to one year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, the types in Portugal fell 30 basic points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published.
The estimated figures are about 10,000 million in the short term and other 15,000 potentials and have until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumed within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which a political commitment is needed to demonstrate that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment dream of investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has raised 4.5%, the double that the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and decisive and we are benefiting from the surprising effect.
Today there is a key auction from a three-year bonus that will be benefited by the Trichet effect so we expect it to be resolved with strong demand and help resolve the doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Help Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 4 billion in cash available the triple that in March, to expensive types and closes your access to day-to-day markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's woman, "in addition to being it, it seems".
Let's go, we can.
The President of Eulen will challenge the Vega Sicilia board requested by his children
The time is no longer in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will object, when he considers it "no full right", to the court board of El Enebro on the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to make their majority stand and deal with the management bodies of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are refining the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute over the group's control.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in the government bodies of El Enebro.
Of his board of directors, five of his seven children who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' assembly on 18 January this year and whose complaint is recorded in the Mercantil Registry.
The court board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the Mercantil No. 2 of Madrid, has once again opened the box of truenos within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the summons of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants' five children to try to validate and heal the radically null board on 18 January, by means of procedural error, and abuse of law, according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis on which, once the Board is held, it will be challenged to consider it to be "no full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried to get the magistrate to convene a board in June.
In El Enebro, the estate company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven children of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of services claims, however, the benefit over 51 per cent of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the fundamental issue that the judge must decide upon once the view on the claim is held, for which there is no date indicated.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software designs improvements in real-time cars.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a newly arrived ski resort and, despite the rising trail of the last season, last November, in the final straight of the championship, all were betting for the Ferrari del Fernando Alonso triumph.
Without thanking the skill as a pilot of the final champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor of the power of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn him into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that Germany placed on the market in 2007 for very far-reaching purposes of high car competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design manufacturing factory assembly chains around the world, energy plants, high precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before actually constructing it, thus avoiding avoidable errors and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements that are detected during the race and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the shields in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team capable of introducing a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 highly qualified professionals work, who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of changes in the balls.
Siemens's directive explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all the elements of Red Bull's balls except the engine, which is of the full responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be made from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced high-tech laser production systems and autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological improvement is the $40 million figure that each Formula 1 team can spend as much as possible in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech factory to design and produce its balloons in a locality about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The template for this performance is 580 people, including its two pilots, the Vettel and Mark Webber champion.
Red Bull's Formula 1 hero is no doubt the latest Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the vast technological resources that the energy drink brand has put into service for its participation in the circuits are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their zero awareness.
The factory's technology chief Steve Nevey said that five years ago it was possible to say that R+D advances in car cars contributed 50% of the wins and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology amounts to 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install its own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration are his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of 20 business networks between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multimarca centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and the English Court.
The Vice President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, put as an example the remodelled store located in the Grand Via Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, who has been working with him for 30 years.
The North American Group has prepared a plan to place 200 brand points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open was Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being Barcelona's third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also ensured that the philosophy of installing stores will always be the same, based on a local distributor with experience and knowledge in the sector.
The US Group advises and deals with the exclusive furniture design of shops (with products that can be played in an interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a system of frankness and stressed that the exclusive trading network aims "to improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, paying attention, posing and even packaging".
The Barcelona Store includes a space with a global pioneer pilot program that is responsible for solving the potential problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht, the Netherlands.
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bet for stealing a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banko Sabadell's delegate adviser, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and vetos the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it provides for a breakdown of interest margins, which will try to offset in part with commission increases and the credit price.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, his outstanding assignment.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch in 2011 a new management plan that will have a three-year effect.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need to rely on FROB's public aid, is to gain market share with the capture of a million new private customers -700,000 if those who can get out of the bank are discounted, its large outstanding allocation, since so far it has been feeding the SMEs and businesses more than the retailer.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be presented by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare these times to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has affected all the plans of the global bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year's Optima Director's plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation has led to a further expansion of it.
Customers who let the savings box escape will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "hard and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, believes that the output of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", something fundamental to the survival of banking business, he insisted.
And although he believes that the passive war - which penalizes the margins - is being reduced, the price of risk premiums that are paying banks and cash for their emissions for liquidity are already being transferred to the credit price to compensate for the drop in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and funding is structural, and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the grip, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already ordered his network on Thursday to limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the differentials - see Five Days on 22 and 27 November.
He also recognized that the bank's trend now is "to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not discard corporate transactions.
Not in vain, make sure that in Spain "greater sizes are required."
"The coming year will move everything," he said.
He claims that capital needs are "very high" and does not dismiss any Spanish financial entity from entering red numbers.
It points out that Frob can supply the market with funds before new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important for some bankers to Vatican already as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which slows down the crisis.
The ECSC rejects a second wave of mergers in the boxes
ECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta rejected yesterday that there was going to be a flow of savings box mergers and again insisted on the speed at which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When he started the concentration process of the Spanish savings boxes, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Fundings (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that this new wave of operations would take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the group of the Civic Bank cannot be said to be a second round, which there are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all major processes have already been done and are being screened by the Bank of Spain, which has also worked very closely," the director said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Aragón Guidelines and Executives (ADA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is being affected "as fast as possible, and we must be very satisfied with how it is going to take place within the timeframes that, not now, were marked in business plans with the Bank of Spain," he stressed.
"To move from 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky views on the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and meaning" because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ensured that Spain has the most stringent financial system across Europe and "probably" of the world, and assigned to those who put it on trial a "failure of knowledge".
The directive pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings boxes, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and that "go as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank was very well off from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a double governmental response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, the regulation of private placement or cancellation agencies of EUR 426 non-performance stop aid, until the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of State Lottery.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined in criticizing Chancellor Angela Merkel for his responsibility to resolve the current crisis.
How do these movements have to be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not an error in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is once again in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shocks it to maintain the old traditions of many of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about the three possible solutions to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among others, would leave the monetary area in the south.
Secondly, the recovery of the framework, although now seems science fiction, with a very favourable opinion flow, is close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redistribution of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries that are cross-border, possible suspensions of payments from some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now there is no excuse.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government withdrew from Manga a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of differences between what Germany believed should be done (tax rigour and stability in public finances) and what were being practiced by its European partners, including France.
The second one was the Central European country when Merkel severely extended Greece's rescue decision.
It was already a subject of critical ferocity, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public opinion and public opinion were very opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel once again emerges with a clear position, requiring the reform of the Union treaties, in order to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run along the coast.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European because it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweet, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the process of Union reform, which enables those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although it is now necessary to take measures that may not be very agreed upon, from that date on, the former functioning of the euro will have ended.
In 2013, it will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which criminal countries will be severely punished, may be forced to be declared suspended and, in that case, the private sector will also run at the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a tough path of growth with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as that which has presided over Spanish growth in the years of boom, will simply not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand.
This is not just about reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand from us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will lead to greater calm.
And let us take advantage of the opportunity window that has been given to us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his dual expression (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms to Merkel, the thesis that must be put home has been opened.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't seem to be moving.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, the abandonment of an excessive monetary zone from countries that are not serious cannot be excluded.
Then Germany can always tell us that it has already warned us.
Sport and fraud of law
Tretas such as those of Alonso and Ramos before Ajax demonstrate engineering but not the will to escape a penalty.
The alleged expulsion by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink to be written about whether or not such behavior is anti-sportable and whether both players should be punished by UEFA.
As it is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which his team had clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time in removing missing tracks to cause the arbitrator to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since the Real Madrid will end up as leader of its group, both players will meet the regulatory penalty for the next party of the league, against Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has punished the team coach José Mourinho with two parties and with different economic amounts for the players involved.
The challenge of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather often in the football world.
It is so extensive that it is part of the ethos, of the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate in this case is due to the fact that it has been staged by a team of the real Madrid entity (which in its hymn assumes honour and honour, and has sometimes punished its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, who adds an episode more to his dilated history of hysterical and provocative technique.
In any event, the debate revolves around whether this kind of conduct which is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether such actions are unlawful; indeed, they are actions that are respectful of the sport regulation, but seem to be misleading.
The issue is to examine the type of harm that causes the sports spirit.
One of the things that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, the aspect that was not put at risk by these actions, i.e. there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that are traded with the clean game is to prevent the team from taking unfair advantage of the other team, which also did not happen.
Now, the paradoxical action of the players of the Real Madrid is that it did not lie to what we normally characterize as fraud or fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not made to hide to try to avoid punishment, but that precisely its action sought to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage do offenders gain from the intentional shortcomings they are considering.
It seems necessary to note here that there is no disadvantage to the rival or benefit in the same party, as the result of the action is obviously to leave the team with fewer players.
And neither is it a useful strategy for the next match, as the club cannot count on those players.
The advantage is, of course, that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future party.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of uncertainty, as the team can be removed from the first exchange, and in addition to this action, players complete a penalty party and pass to the second card cycle, in which the card accumulation suspension takes place with less than the first cycle.
So if you're going around, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
Finally, these actions do not go against the sports spirit, which is part of strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
Of course, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud by law), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without getting the punishment or running away from it.
Although the frontier between engineering and fraud of law is widespread, on this occasion I think it was a clear case of engineering.
The debate, I think, arises by two factors: because it was about two self-emissions and the way in which the directive was passed on to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture the Christmas dinners of groups at NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates on an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
Self-supply celebrations are spread by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tournament and the lottery, with the arrival of December, the group dinners before Christmas are also back, which continue to be used as an oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but because of the crisis they have dropped into an offensive of adjusted prices in order to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, the entrepreneurs and associations in the interviewed sector agree.
In order to make accounting more difficult, this year's calendar (when Nochevieja fell on Friday) has focused the requests on the week of December 13, with the result that until the date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for days (on 16 and 17) and only movement for the previous week.
As has already been happening since 2008, when the flat cow stage began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners on budgetary issues.
To avoid disregarding tradition, many workers keep paying for it from their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, some and others demand battle prices, confirm the president of the Barcelona Restoration Group, Gaietà Farrà.
The representative of the patron, today, does not dare to Vatican what the celebrations of this month will be like.
"People think so much before booking."
"He wants to get out but he has the alerts on the price issue," he points out.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good price and with good service", adds, and remembers that customers tend to lower a ladder with the crisis, so that the gap around 25 euros has become the majority of the demand.
In a survey of various central establishments, the collapse of requests for the night of 17.
In the Soteras group, they say there is a genuine boom of applications for Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with full formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has taken on more early reservations, including since early November.
"We have done everything impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they say.
In AN Group, which abandons El Mussol, Attic, Quu, and up to a total of 23 locations, they maintain optimism after finding an increase in billing since the second half and a few good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Group sources highlight that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the parties.
Its six group menus have added one Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a pre-disposal to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as a cave.
They also see green explosions in some companies that invite their employees again and feel that the volume of groups is something bigger.
On behalf of Captain Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Bar Association, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), his vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts to begin to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that the reservations are "animal", although the customers "negotiated to the maximum".
That's right, the illusion for the parties hasn't come down, pays who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks filtration confirms the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the clarifications and juicy details that offer about the content of the conversations and thoughts of US diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between both countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that weapons are not collected but are stored by components to make it difficult for them to be destroyed in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for the discovery in Washington.
This is how Ambassador Anne W. Patterson lists him in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the noisey dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States but also by Russia, as a proliferator and reason for maintaining the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a meeting with their US counterparts.
The most innovative of the documentation filtered by the Julian Assange portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani rate of nuclear weapons production.
A delegation from the Embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", maintains: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or discarded".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "make it very clear" to the responsible that "the Pakistani Army must end up with the tactical support of terrorist groups".
To the hunt of the chief Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism to avoid new filtrations.
Interpol emits a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange where it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Moreover, it is not new, but it is the date of 20 November.
And it does not have to do with the latest filtration of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse faced by the Australian in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks creator's lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
It was the 20th day when the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at Sweden's request, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after obtaining permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "with a view to its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, consider the so-called network notice free to proceed with a arrest -- which must accommodate the national police body -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has upset Assange lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to respond by videoconference to questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange applied and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor's case, compared to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's chief of security.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the misiver said.
While the world is looking for it - and from Australia her mother defends her child's innocence-- Assange continues on unknown landing, but not silent.
On Monday, from an indefinite location, he gave an interview to the Time magazine director through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering US diplomats to spy on the United Nations violating international treaties that the US has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the resignation request as "sudden and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," the CNN said.
Obama himself has been responsible for the anti-terrorism struggle, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to remain important to Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will be chaired by the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January, has asked the Department of State to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and pursue any of their contributions or assistance".
Even further has gone to Tom Flanagan, a Canadian president Stephen Harper's advisor, who has had to withdraw after saying that Assange should be "killed".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, Arkansas ex - governor and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever has filtered the information into the Government is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind of punishment," said Fox.
Puigkós search for peace in ERC with guides at the likes of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercos seems to have found the recipe to get the enemies of the internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party's president is aware that his hideout is insufficient for the purposes of exhilarating Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is as dilute today as his own mentor and that he can absolutely cause the headbreakers that he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the Left leader will try to win the new critics with gloves that allow him to protect himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 ERC national councillors will be able to speak about their continuity in secret.
By paper, and not by hand.
If the Cardists want to pass a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of the row wants to avoid the image of division as well as submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said that it would not be considered ratified by half of the votes, but he added, without specifying percentages, that it would not be a good result "to Bulgaria".
The next to Carod requires the president to make his position available to the militants, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercos controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But when they don't have enough to force them to resign, they'll try to agree with the executive a road map from here in May.
To this end, they look forward to participating in the preparation of the strategic re-orientation document that the Directorate will submit to the vote of the National Council on day 18.
Its intention is to pour down Puigcercos instead of promising to advance the convention in the fall of 2011, something that the dome already gives in fact.
The leader of the ERC acknowledged that "polyphony" is harmful to stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash the dirty stairs from door to door.
In this line, it is symptomatic that the advisor in functions Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercos, the owner of Innovacion said that the leader would be called "in exchange for various objectives".
And he numbered five of them, two of whom stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militia, i.e. to include new faces coming from the sector like Carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
It therefore advocates a reform of the statutes to allow conventions to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession with the Puigcercos team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave was entrusted with the task of revising the assembly at a specific convention of statute reform.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of the past few years has discouraged the issue from being addressed.
Now, without critical sectors at hand, it can be a good time to take it back and try to close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to MILLENIO State of Mexico, there was a decrease in four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 persons were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the content of the MILLENIO State of Mexico.

In the woman's skin, tattoos of the Holy Death were detected, as well as glues with her image.
In the last part of the month, a man's body was found on board a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of a couple of men with a pregnant head and a message were found in the community of Ponte de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed supposedly by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who are not aligned."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found in the interior of a taxi abandoned behind the San Agustín colony's Centre of Justice.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcoyotl.

Along with him, the agents found a postcard with a message.
Maintains China's objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of that country in COP16 ensured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supported its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of that country in COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), His Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, he explained that in the last four years his country had invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it was clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work with the international community in that regard.
He said that the Chinese climate change strategy was divided into four sections: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and pilot programme support.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including last year's approval, of a new Energy Act, which gathers the objectives set for the reduction of gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with states and locals to achieve energy saving targets, efficient use of energy and emission reduction.
In addition, they are already in progress or have already completed several multiannual plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and which received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for the exchange of incandescent focusses by savers and one more mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than they generally think.
For example, the per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent over the last five years, and plans to do so much more by 2020, he has made.
Attached to the legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN said that the former Panist leader was entitled to come to the National Order Commission to claim what was appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was linked to the rule of law and that the former leader of the PAN was entitled to come to the National Order Commission to claim what was appropriate to his right.
In a previous interview with Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken in the local area.
"It is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Committee."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal to the National Council's Committee on Orders, where appropriate, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, it clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that there has never been an alliance for presidential candidacy at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that National Action will be strengthened by the internal election of the next 4-5 December, in which it will have to elect its successor.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach for the local election that was successful and achieved the goal," he said.
The Panist leader stated that the PAN supported 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; we enjoy it and strengthen it", he noted.
He said that the council would no doubt know how to choose the best or the best leader who requires National Action for the next three years, from which it will deliver the slogan "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquillity and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the party president's office."
He predicted that the party's response in the past July 4th elections will be reflected in the next content, although "it's not time to think about 2012."
"For now it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be the reason for observation throughout the country, so that "many hopes, desires are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
When asked about the criticisms of the PRI to President Felipe Calderón by his speech within the four years of his government, César Nava called upon the Pristines to reflect on the sexes of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas of Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon; that they start defending them; that they leave the castle," he said.
He felt that the head of the Federal Executive could make such expressions as in his speech at the National Auditorium because there was no bite or much less censorship in the country.
Promote Obama on Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree that adopting Dream Act law is the right thing to do, call your senators and install them to approve it is legislation," the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization today in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree that adopting Dream Act law is the right thing to do, call your senators and install them to approve it is legislation," Obama tweeted.
Its brief message maintains an open cyber link with a broader document asking the public to communicate immediately with the senators, since the vote of the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that is expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice hear," he says.
The message was released after the 42 republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation unless the extension of the Bush tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Speaker Robert Gibbs entrusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable for the rest of the projects could be set.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax matter before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point at that time and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "conclusion vote" for the Dream Act law, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream Act would legalize some 800 thousand young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years and have joined a higher education institution or army.
But the supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the competition of a handful of Republicans, when the project's partner organizations protagonize an intense cabal to ensure the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Therefore, the Dream Act supporters require several Republicans to join in the event that other Democrats decide to give back to the initiative.
Among the most Courtesy Republicans are Senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have declared that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger in the laga
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where the participants galvanized the narrative
"It's from the sex in the language I understand but... the finger in the laga? what is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to the sex in the language, explained).
The finger in the laga... "put us in a good mood," the Argentine writer welcomed the public, mostly young, who was quoted at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate round table by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in first person as the protagonist who is seeking to know what the "laga" is, goes from a doctor, from which she does not get answers even though it is clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist he goes on to say, "The patience is not my strength, maybe it's my lie."
Finally, after a frustrated approach to the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the hall, but whoever makes it clear that it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the lie is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed and concluded "of the lake only to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must go very interviewed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story entitled Elogio of the invention, where the finger in the lake is not named but at a moment is discovered.
With brushes of magical realism, there was a famous witch, who played the same thing with clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a virgin had lost, a story that came to talk later America, the great novel that from the beginning did not miss their own chroniclers who had counted it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo as criticizing the excess of the tale by the conquerors.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have told the story of America with the imagination that he missed until the smell."
However, he pointed out "it's the crazy ones and the moustaches that best imagine" and is where it convinces reality and lies, where it is no longer known that the story belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
It's actually called the "cervantine tradition."
"By your inheritance, we are what you mean."
In turn, writer Mayra Montero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger in the laga.
The Puerto Rican Cuban pointed to the great scourge of social violence that penetrates its country - and shares Latin America - the product of drug trafficking and trafficking disputes.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs include a tactical commitment that of course is not premedicated," he said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
On the night the Spanish poet Luis García Montero closed it, whose speech also emphasized "that finger in the lajama of the writer's committed.
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of the consciousness that renders dogmatism, forgetting "that behind every assertion there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To be the owners of our thinking and to be the owners of reality we have to kill: and to kill often means to put your finger on the lax and to disturb those who are much more comfortable thinking of cartoon, in black and white, in established ideas and without math and also to disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Roman goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, has had strikes in his career, but has been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, has had altipations in his career, but has been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting with the medal of the sub-campeon, has remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive ends.
The holy strategy came to its first final as a coach at the 2002 Open Tournament, when it carried the returns of the Morelia with which it fell globally from 4-2 to Toluca; later, in the 2003 closure it also came to the decisive sorrow and also lost it with a global of 3-1 and it was precisely before Rayados.
With Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, again before the Devils, Rubén again suffered a reverse, as his team ended up 2-2 in front of the choristers after 210 minutes of play, but in the penaltis tank he took advantage of 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 volleyball.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same fate, seeks to get rid of the evil and can first celebrate a title, although he claims that the institution is the most important for him.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, it's for an affection that I owe myself, and therefore the title will come for me, but the previous one is the most important," said the tymonal when questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very current has the previous end, of which he assures, has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the end of the syllable the end we can't celebrate, we are ready on the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two shots to pull we were already ready to run out and I think that's a teaching, until the party is finished we can celebrate".
To know that this series could be defined in criminal shots, something that doesn't bother you, because it trusts its players: "You never try to get to the crime scene, you try to end up in regular time, but sometimes there's no one else and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad game, sometimes by the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but that left us something for this end that we hope we don't get to that instance."
Romano has in his hands to stop being a sub-camping technician and for the first time to prove the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules for obtaining visas
Persons should visit Visa Applicants Service centres before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as waiting time.
With effect from 10 January 2011, the procedure for the processing of a visa in the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants should visit the Visa Applicants Service Centres (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The staff of the SCA will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of handling the visa will be lower, no longer will be necessary to make a payment to conclude the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and more so that the mail service will deliver the document.
The sucker will make only one single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for petitioned visas (including temporary workers ' visas) and $390 for traders and investors ' visas.
People wishing to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest CB where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken into the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain at this time less than in the past.
Similarly, those who apply for visas in the Consulates in Juárez City, Monterrey and New Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA will announce extraterrestrial life discovery
The U.S. Space Agency quoted the press to present tomorrow with a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory that there is an extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the person responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and the future of life in the Universe.
In quoting to the press, NASA assured that it would present "a finding that would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures in our pair and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It seems that this is a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, the creature uses arsenic as a way of survival and this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our beneficial atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be demonstrated that "if there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know".
The space agency will make known the true reach of the findings at the press conference on Thursday morning.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life in March; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who is studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Gesture PRD, PT, Convergence and Block Pattern opponent
With reforms to the Organic Act of Congress, from the arrival of 'bipartisanism', they complain.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged at Congress, headed by PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of the 'bipartism' to the Chamber.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tronaban' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, starting with 'bipartisanism', because now there will be two people, equal to the number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by Panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo said that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He said that in the next few days he would speak to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting with a political will, and if they did not have it, then they would be defeated again by both parties and the opposition coalition ended.
"So far (the opposition coalition) has arrived, that is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, not even have the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Pattern, there are coincidences and are therefore forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress after being monopolies, now be "duopolese".
"It is not the spirit of reforming the law that has an eternal bipathism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other partners and partners to make them more, the convergence was abundant.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that the Congress was currently becoming a 'botion' between two, in line with the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're dividing it between two."
Mr Montalvo, asked for respect for the personality of the Member, gave him his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not by collective agreements, it is left out to 5 that we are probably going to make 9 Members, save the five who see us, separated into different groups, we have decided to unify ourselves to find a place at the negotiating table, that is the subject that in the reform that they made they agreed on, we are gone and we do not agree with that reform."
Out $200 thousand more for "the supplier"
Pay Mazatlán City Hall another check to the questioned owner of electrical material company.
A check for just over 200 thousand pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was sent by the City Hall.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical material company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on 16 November, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "decommissioning of accounts for payment".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that he would issue more money from the Commune in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the State's Higher Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total amount still due to him and, therefore, how much more checks are left for sending to Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, it's just paying you what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of October 15, 19 October, 29 October and the last of November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Act marks when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to avoid other Governments using its services, the Treasury assured that they have not reused its services.
The previous, after 25 July, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, which revealed that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, in the Triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos to the municipality through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he paid checks for more than 3 million pounds.
Urgen to serve tourist sites
Regrettant tourist businessmen of the foreign tourist accident due to poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Gloriata Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to give attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced the image of the destination and to reverse the evil that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and the banquets has affected because tourists are coming to see the mess and take him back to the nearby business.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close one day a company and don't have the idea of the lost diner, or otherwise they won't do the works in time and without proper planning."
Hoteler José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the downfall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the Town Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibilities and avoid happening again, how to do so by providing preventive maintenance and not only by falling into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other places that also light careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Escudo and the Vendaito de Mazatlán.
"Today, in order for the tourist to come not only depends on promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, in its avenues, permanent maintenance in what tourist attractions are," he said.
"The due attention has not been given and this kind of fact points out something that is not known to everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said it is urgent to rescue tourist sites from Mazatlán, as they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put on line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city every day, clean, orderly and be attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Happyly Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put on the line to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Requests IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example of a better Sinaloa for the various challenges they face.
A decent and free labour legislation between parties and the State Executive claims the Mazatlán business sector, because there is a convulsive Sinaloa facing major problems.
Since yesterday, 60 legislatures have been established, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which is a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State is that they will be able to manage clean and committed with society and with the different sectors requiring responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanism or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly absent 40 members of the State Congress take the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa through the various challenges facing him.
"We hope that the Members really exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnival fairs of the governors and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He therefore said that they were certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that led to the Governor in turn.
"We are busy doing a decent job, especially committed to society and the sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Island Hotel Association, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces to seek economic growth in the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push for economic growth, which creates incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will in some way encourage job generation."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators put the burden on him within the State budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with a lower budget and it is inconsistent as an important economic activity and generating money and investment and that it directly competes with the agri-industrial sector."
In addition to the need to label resources for detonating tourist projects and to assist in providing security to the state and updating the Alcohols Act which had not been able to resolve in previous legislations.
Searching for a magician king
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next Reyes Day will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they want.
The family lives in a humble house in the Colonia Salvador Allende and lives today because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes we see her hard because my husband doesn't have a leg, but we sell mandarin and papa... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'blebes' to sell on the street," said Cayettena Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long long been looking forward to having a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayettena suggests a waistcoat for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster,' but I said to him, 'Let's see a son,' for he was very face-to-face,' he recalled with sadness Cayettena.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, uses size eight.
José Juan, 14 years of age, lacks tennis, so a couple of five and a half or six would be a lot of help.
If you want to help make the dream come true for the children of the Crowna Valenzuela family you can participate in the campaign Seek a Mago King, giving a toy or effective in the receive of northwest.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Austria, a decade of persecution has been carried out as part of the dismantling of a Cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
The persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places where drug production was carried out.
"Approximately 750 plants of Cannabis have been seized, four kilos of hachis, money and equipment for production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face the Cannabis production charges, possession with the aim of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have taken place after a long investigation that has lasted for about a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has enabled us to carry out the arrests," Mr. Ruel said.
In this police operation, about seventy police officers participated in the Estrie Research Module of the Security of Quebec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Department.
It will be possible to fight illegal migration without problems
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the Government, should solve the problem of the father-in-laws charged with clandestine migrants, will certainly face a major opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter."
"I'm here with a party that has created the granite you're on," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals defend that the bill in its present form, which would allow any person who is engaged in a ship identified as a transport of illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Bloque, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong white.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the Government is doing," said Mr Duceppe.
NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms that indicate that her party is not strong enough with clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-democratics agree that measures are being taken against the leaders of clandestine fathers, and that is what we intend to do with another bill, the C-35," says Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the draft law of the Conservatives because it attacks refugees and incarcerates children for at least one year," says Mrs. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenny, has accused the parties of the position to play politicians and to ignore the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs not to tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and treat the country as if it were a felony."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," said Minister Kenny.
The Government had not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
A conservative, however, informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request a vote so that each member who was going to oppose would be explained in advance to his or her electors.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Although the possibility of establishing a permanent anti-corruption and collision unit had been announced by Jean Charest, many observers continued to request the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security Robert Dutil supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Research in New York since January last year.
Metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, the announcement of Tuesday has taken more than one by surprise.
It should be said that, during a Permanent Council meeting on Quebec police services held last 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
That was enough for the party's criticism of the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to be described as "a rabbit pulled from the jaw" and as "a last-hour capucher solution".
The Minister for Customs, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he just says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public investigation.
"The more Mr. Charest gets caught up in avoiding the creation of this commission of research, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead point, he suggested that Quebec be given a special mandate to the ombudsman to conduct a collision and corruption survey.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the ombudsman," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent framework is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also asks Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be brought by the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed on his part that his counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is now inclined to make certain amendments to this issue.
During the spring 2001 operation related to motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Act on gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several water courses are being monitored closely because of the strong rainfalls that have been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, an earth run took place in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, houses have been evacuated.
At night, another flow of land took place in Saint-Lin-Laurenties, Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded strong precipitation, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
In addition, an additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The sectors located north of the river and in the valley of Outauouais were the most affected.
They could get up to 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations are added to the snowfall already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts for the Oueau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chene, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, strong precipitation has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the landing of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civilian security unit continues to be alerted and closely monitored, as indicated by Annik Bouchard, the Security Councillor.
The Quebec Growth Forecast Centre, for its part, issued Wednesday advertisements communicating the strong growths of several rivers, including Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouereau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partly blame in Dupont
Quebec Radio Presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain reversal before the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements on social assistance and on Haitians, as well as for their gross language on the radio.
The CCNR considered that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, improperly negative representation of Haitians and gross language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day".
The Council has also indicated that the discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Joint Front of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must communicate reliable data and not lead to deception.
With regard to suicide, the presented by Stéphane Dupont had shown that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to the problems of life.
"Most of the Committee considers that the episodes reported by "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate manner."
In this respect, therefore, any guilt has been removed.
The last dispute referred to statements made after the Haiti earthquake.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort had staged a media confrontation that had generated many reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needed people were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an improperly negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," said the presenter.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of gross language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has collaborated "including more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, which must, inter alia, announce decisions once in the hours of a three-day hearing.
A king of the kung fu in Montreal
The evidence of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who highlights in "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, goes up to the world's tatamisms and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the game on the ground that involve mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and employee of the UPS, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Association (WKA) World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the World Cup of San Shou in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished among the first four positions in the world's last championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended up in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I ended the tournament in fifth place, but I reached the third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What's interesting is I've been making progress in every competition."
"To this step, I will be the first time this year!"
The "san show" or "sand" is an original discipline from China in which it is allowed to hit with your fists and feet, as well as throw your opponents to the ground.
Meetings are initially held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this kind of fight is the American of Vietnamese Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Mother Earth has only to maintain a competition in her career, she will certainly go to the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung fu.
"This competition is China's most famous and prestigious," explains the friendly boy.
"It's like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand's largest stadium). "
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost at the end.
"What you've earned me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The semi-final winners face the end of their category."
"Then, the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in non-procurement contracts
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energie gérance, was created in 2004 as a result of the decision by Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this important 5 billion-dollar hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of companies' consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause a rise in prices.
"This is a new method of collision and of eliminating competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, are now doing it openly," said the Party MP Sylvain Simard yesterday in a press wheel.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the national Assembly because, as he said, he did not understand how public interest could be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that a collision had occurred with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, defending that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and "with no rigour".
He noted that "minimum" would be that the PQ apologize.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
It is usually an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to a call for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the size of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without the entry into force of the competition; it has been negotiated.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the Quebec standard, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devor published last week, the consortium formula in the technical advice sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick view of Quebec's commercial registration allows for the identification of more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau has pointed out that "the territory of the Bay of James responds to a particular work dynamic and Hydro-Québec has specifically responded to it since the 1970s".
The major head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), has given an explanation that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
"If you respond to an invitation to tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of the people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification, Le Devor has identified 109 technical advice contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Geneva has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, regardless of its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Energy Management Contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has made it clear that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has let it fall that the PQ is also linked to these companies, that they "finance it", before it is stated that it is rather about their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecologically, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer only trusts in actors in sustainable development, as well as in fair trade marks and environmental certificates to guide their elections.
According to the Responsible Consumer Barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where they pulse messages that defend more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even inhibits its commitment.
Even if consumption of products called "socially responsible" has increased in 2010, Quebecans seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say that they do not, in fact, trust in the environmental commitment of companies or in their environmental advertising, reveal the measuring tool developed by the Sherbrooke University's responsible Consumer Observatory.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates bearing products called just, as well as the credibility of products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "correspondable", says Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecans take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about one third of the Quebecan consumers.
In fact, the gaps and suspicious nature of the information make 46 per cent of consumers wish this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecans also say that they are not aware of the alleged performance of the organic products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their beliefs.
Approximately 61 per cent has given priority to shopping in its neighborhood shops and has preferred to buy food grown in its region, says Barometer.
More green and responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points above a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus de Quebec loves to occupy the position of the king of the recycling that tries to reduce its environmental impact by worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to Barometer, this social consciousness seems to be from outside doors: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecans indicated that they had used public transport or shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavior survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and pedestrian movements.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been requested to make a financial commitment to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus and the Parallel Society, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Angus and the Parallel Development Society, which expected a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois again the eXcentris cinematic complex in the Boulevard Saint-Laurent and return his true film vocation, did not get what they were asking.
The Government has accepted to be involved in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would, in fact, be less than the initial expectations; it could be a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan last spring and an application of 12.8 million, but since then applications have been reviewed at the bottom.
The president of the Society for the Development of Cultural Entrepreneurs (SODEC), François Macerola, who led the eXcentris file, forwarded a proposal and plan of action to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report a decade ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have a deadline until 31 December to respond.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation should be completely discarded.
We recall that the Quebec Film Chamber Owners Association and cinema complexes opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector are calling for considerable economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the film, has been carrying the author's film for ten years at his complex premises, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is patented in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to trust his clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to open the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallel, has been still projecting films in eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms next February 27th, projecting the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the low proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the complex of Canadians with respect to the U.S., but at the same time reflect the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-United States relations when they are going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government to get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy of Ottawa and Washington, which have been made public yesterday, provide rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during a full federal electoral campaign, reports to what extent the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This surprised the US ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations about this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority that is practically inherent in Canadians when dealing with day-to-day domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign), " he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is "the provocative elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about."
The ambassador has even more problems understanding this 'silver silence' because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
" Logically, you think, the ability of a candidate, a party and, more importantly, the head of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which voters should think when they vote."
This sense of importance can also be observed by Terry Breese, who is responsible for business in Ottawa on 22 January 2009 to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"His trip will help ensure the government's survival during the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, through which Canada will record for the first time a deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40,000 million," writes Mr. Breese.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that opposition parties had to condition their survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington about the increasingly negative image that broadcasts the drama series broadcast to the U.S.C.C.
The ambassador is concerned about the issue of Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even to kidnappings for the CIA to carry out energetic interrogations.
Another cable says that during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some of Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but he depended "on every case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the State Secretary for Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the spirits have been warmed up in connection with the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former counselor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's radio that the responsible for this massive escape should be "killed".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee is made echoes.
A Global Plan to Renovate Enlightenment
Yesterday, the United Nations has proposed in Cancún a plan for the renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in hundreds of countries to reduce greenhouse gas (GEI) to an amount almost one-third of the additional reduction that needs to be carried out to stabilise the planet's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is reflected in the set of major concrete projects that the United Nations expects to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bombs, which still monopolies between 50% and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bombs or, better still, by electroluminescent diodes (DEL or LED) bombs, much of the 1,800 million tonnes of GEI (Gt) emitted on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the planetary motor park.
In Copenhagen, last year, large emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce GI global emissions from GI from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, a further 5 Gt of this quantity should be reduced to stabilise, by 2020, the two-degree increase in temperatures to avoid uncontrollable.
In the incandescent pumps, 95% of the energy is dissolved in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. a 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact pumps, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new LED pumps, energy consumption is reduced twice more.
Fluocompact pumps last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bombs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80 per cent less energy than an incandescent bomb, which allows us to make an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would apply in one hundred countries.
These new bombs can also work with rebossates and emit very little heat.
Above, they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations regarding the fluo-compact pumps, since they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless the manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet are not the fluo-compact pumps, but the coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is blown off with the incandescent bombs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save billions of dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2,500 million.
Costa de Marfil eagerly awaits announcement of election results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, since the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and immediately announce the provisional results," stressed a spokesman for the head of the United Nations.
"Ask all sides of the Costa de Marfil and the institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline of Wednesday to Wednesday night without the results being published, three days since Sunday's election.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the chairman of the IEC had commented on the television that the commission "was still working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, requests for the IEC to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have been multiplied in the world.
However, the Gbagbo gang has been in favour of the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the "fraud" votes in the north, in the hands of the former New Forces (UN) rebellion since the coup d'état failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Costa de Marfil campaign, said that the intimidation maneuvers of UN voters in the north of the country had deterred the followers of the outgoing president from going to vote.
All elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, the Gbagbo opponents consider that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged "unacceptable" the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies said that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew that he had lost and that he had filed a complaint before the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results.
The second round of the presidents, on Sunday, should have been the focus of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two years ago.
The United Nations had warned the political class of Costa de Marfil on Wednesday that they could be considered responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had ended in the first round, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the votes against 32 per cent of Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent in continental territory (9.7 per cent taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected by the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of stops remains at 2,631,000 in continental France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3 per cent of the population active in continental territory and 9.7 per cent with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has recorded an increase of 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, are not available in the two weeks to work and seek employment or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a new increase in unemployment rate up to 24.2% in continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older people, up to 6.4% in continental France (+0.2 points in three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, which amounts to 6.6% with DOMs.
Only a balance between 25 and 49 years of age has been recorded, with 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Since 2006, the Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, following a debate on its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union Statistics Agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guerini, 53 years old, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guerini is being investigated for abuse of social property, misuse of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, as indicated by his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all questions raised by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue you through a lot of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them," he told AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's presence.
Mr. Guerini, a brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his presence, a document to be explained.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and incarcerated one of their neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to your lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done has been to take care of the landfills you have to manage.
As to the allocation of contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about them, as the lawman Simon says.
As part of this dossier, it has also been investigated since Wednesday, Daniel Pinna, former director-general of the services of the urban agglomeration in Aubagne, for misappropriation of funds and complicity, but it has been released conditionally and has been banned from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The Master Teacher has taken into account the explanations and has released him," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as stated by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of the property of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), has been charged with "trafficking of influences and passive corruption".
Two officials of the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier agglomeration have been questioned by "the abstraction and abuse of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and by "complicated in the misuse of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion Jeannie Peretti is being investigated for "covering the abuse of social property".
Among the people who have met Mr. Guerini are Mr. Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently incarcerated in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corcega.
The researchers suspect that their societies have a service to whiten the capital of the great bandidism.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to research points out that the research focuses especially on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Aubagne, as well as other cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Subject Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has exacerbated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, Clotilde Reiss's fate, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", has been in the city of France, has warned of diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the close look of US diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Eliseo has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own "rehenes" crisis in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the French youth did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought US justice by trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram drawn up on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
Eliseo's strategic adviser, François Richier, accompanied by Quai d'Orsay's director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, spoke with US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held by force in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "continuingly release" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
Everything to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often."
Because once the attempts to negotiate by discreet channels are exhausted, "the silence will not solve anything", Iranians are "experts in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a common Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day when he will be taken to the embassy of France) "will require payment to Iranians of a large amount of money" (EUR 230,000).
He also notes that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "is going to increase".
Iranians could "in the near future stop another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released after 12 days, but remains locked up in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge ' s decision.
The US Embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is near the Iranian clandestine nuclear material acquisition networks, Majid Khakavand's excartion is a bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Release Iranian instead of French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier made sure it wasn't.
El Elisha, says, "has not only been greatly surprised by the judge's decision", but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot annul the decision" he said.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is still under the "strict" surveillance of French information services.
The councillor of Eliseo marks a telephone number, picks up and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in a Paris building managed by the Iranian embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, Eliseo does not spare efforts, he uses communications and "fugees" organized in the media to make it believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and "impressive" role of "mediator".
The U.S. observed this activity with certain irony and verified that the manipulation brought its fruit, as several press articles transmitted the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is due to such "gratitude" to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their full statements of praise, French officials recognize in private that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led to Elisha for this fiction.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening towards Syria", he said.
A policy launched in 2008, "in the view of many critical voices in France and abroad, it has just been struck by premeditation and disparagingness".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris tries to "show Syria the praise that it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to "sow the seed of the dispute between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows this from good source.
On August 11, François Richier entrusted him with: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, if we thank him."
"At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Eliseo.
In a communiqué, thank the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria who have played an "active paper for the liberation of our compatriot".
From midnight, Korean youths cannot play online
The South Korean Government is about to adopt a law called "Cenicivent" that will prevent adolescents from participating in online games after midnight blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
In December a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, as representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Family have indicated.
"Many children play all night and then it's hard for them to study at school and live a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, precisely.
The government also intends to ask companies that limit daily access time to these games when the parents of young people so request, the manager added.
In addition, it will make available to anyone who requests free software to limit Internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the indisputable champion of global online games competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
Global 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by corruption suspicions, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints Thursday to the world Cup organizers of 2018 and 2022, a clear political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying can take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear: the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, traditional discipline bastion (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, since the International Federation hopes to acquire new territories (Qatar, Australia), after an outpost on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of the Belgian and Dutch Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a world.
Transactions between builders, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Furthermore, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, the English, Hispanic and U.S. candidates (2018) and 2022 have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of his country, with one of the footballers, who only welcomed the World once, in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the house on Monday by distributing a documentary that showed three influential EC members Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to dishearten FIFA and shame the English leaders, who have been throwing themselves into an intense lobbying over the last few weeks with David Cameron on his head.
The Chief of Government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of JJ.O. 2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore the brightness of England to the EC?
It is not clear, since the two Spanish-Portugals also have many strengths thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (Mundial del 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal are all they can do is give points to Russia, converted into a weight outside despite the gaps in its candidacy (stages, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced an "unfaithful competence in the preparation of the vote" in a direct statement to the accusations of the English press against EC members.
"They're getting out to lighten their dirty traps, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has 1994 experience, seems to be the most logical favourites.
First world economic power and headquarters of the main FIFA sponsors, the country seems to benefit Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the World 2026 to China, which is eagerly desired by the FIFA, would cause Asia to lose its chances for 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has submitted its project based on futuristic stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue with its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries are more at risk than you are sure.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be damaged by the weakness of TV rights paid by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: test
Of Gaulle, he had really doubted.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt whatsoever.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less.
One mandate in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be re-sponsored in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not combine well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, we must always appear to doubt ourselves.
On one side and on the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, the friends of Jacques Chirac said that he did not reject a third mandate.
On November 15, seriously, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "at some point in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with UMP Members on Tuesday night in Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has led to a certain revelation.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited the number of five-year mandates to two.
I just broadcast the facts, not an announcement.
It's not the first time you talk about presidents, with a funny tone, in encounters of this kind.
"In the worst case, or better, you'll still spend seven and a half years with me," she had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010, "Don't think I'm not going to find out what's going to happen later."
Your statements of anteayer do not come any closer to the candidacy, nor do they.
Sustained comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the career by candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone to the gym, which leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
On the contrary, the fact that its candidacy in 2012 is clear is what leads many people in the PS to claim that the battle is organized before it is planned.
On the other hand, bad probes.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% compared to 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the subject in the UMP," the Prime Minister's environment has responded immediately and prudently.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppe, resigned from the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its procurement of letters from the State
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow for clarification of the way out of the crisis or at least announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations which should end at the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Institute of Emissions cannot be allowed to be so persistent if it does not want to risk exacerbating a more complicated situation in European bond markets today.
The political cost would be equal to the high cost.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, supported the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in the European States.
He did not mean whether he felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its government bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."
On Tuesday, in Brussels, during his hearing with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more talk about his intentions, only indicating that the State's letter purchase programme in the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we will see what we have decided" during the Thursday's meeting.
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will maintain its main variable type by 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's acquisition of the Treasury's obligations has doubled last week to some EUR 1,350 million.
In addition, according to the indiscrete market operators, yesterday it would have purchased Irish and Portuguese titles again.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have acquired securities for an amount of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that they will follow the purchases (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant change in direction.
Although lending operations have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal for more than three months, it still carries out unlimited liquidity allocations under favourable conditions and with durations ranging between one week and three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that I'm going to change your program considerably."
"If not, I would run the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems most likely that a progressive release will take place announced during the first quarter of 2011", anticipates for his side Norbert Bräms, an economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
Regarding public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchasing of these obligations so that the market remains stable," Norbert Bräms adds.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate any price for the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the performances paid by the most fragile States," he said yesterday.
Because if the types of interest are put on the cloud, States will have even more problems to reduce or even stabilize their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government takes over the time
After Italy had begun the week in an alarming way, the situation slightly improved yesterday with the reflection of the types of obligations to 10 years.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional presidents have said that they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "undecipherable" and that a "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements subsequently denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday, the difference with the long-term German rates had reached the record number of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of fracture (CRQ) had been fired up to 263 points, causing a certain revulsion in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German types was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" by "market turbulence" and possible contamination from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, causing the State to run the risk of unable to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have provided a cold water jar for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget under review in the Senate is based on 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (to 3.9% of government forecast) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
The rumor that new budgetary provisions may be applied after the parties, by an amount of EUR 7 billion, can therefore be applied.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be adopted," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of your economy are in order and their accounts are in good condition, as we have said for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, short-term or long-term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested by Italy are less than those required by other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD head economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censorship motion in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period would be unfavourable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think we have already demonstrated on Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly united, determined, committed to the defence of their currency and their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, yesterday's relaxation in the types of European States' obligations has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower the rating of Portugal's debt, the most common white in current speculations.
"As in May, there is really a lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs heavily on banking systems," said the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "political pace is much slower than market pace".
Conscious of this hyat and the hidden dangers, European countries are intensifying the debate to strengthen the mechanisms for getting out of the already existing crisis.
Informal consultations between finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also takes into account Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market economy (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has launched a trip to Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the objective of these visits is not to raise funds, it is certainly to prepare the ground.
The first EFSI securities issues are expected to be implemented next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official representative has entrusted the Reuters agency with the United States' support for a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional IMF direct commitment.
With regard to countries in the first place, Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organization of the labour market.
These reforms add to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path to which Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid all costs of requesting international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that they consider necessary to increase confidence in a sustainable way.
The capitalist partners of the European funds are, last but not least, the options available to speed up the process of standardising public bonds markets.
On 24 November in Paris, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 75 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to withdraw the portfolio again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe that an additional EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
There is the instrument for this: the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism, which currently has EUR 6 billion.
A council that could certainly examine the European capitals in detail.
In particular, market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
The snowflakes continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Britain, and may affect several economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are in orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the twenty departments that were already in orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Meteo France, the strong snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although also snows slightly on the island of France.
A snow layer of between 2 and 5 cm is expected, about 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Isla de France and Lemosín.
The snowflakes are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, Meteo France warns.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lanion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes, has been prohibited.
According to the gendarmeries, traffic on the UK secondary network is complicated, so they recommend that it be not driven unless necessary and that certain TER vehicles are prohibited during the day.
School transportation in Picardia has been banned during Thursday.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture " Urges all drivers to drive with greater caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel 25 per cent of their flights on Thursday at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10 per cent in Orly due to the planned snows.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, South London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro del Grand Paris: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the island of France has reached its peak, thousands of millions have been raining.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the metro of Grand Paris to build the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of EUR 4 billion.
On a theoretical level, this amount will later allow SGP to obtain market loans to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 amending Finance Act, which was discussed in the National Assembly Finance Commission this morning, contains the tools to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in office tax on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a modification of a tax on the offices that already exists "to modernise it, increase its product and target this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows?
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from 4,000 million.
"The tax resources are required to be added to the €4 billion allocation of funds to be mobilised by the State and to be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
"From the time income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as we explained."
"It will be recorded in the budget and used according to needs."
The SGP estimates that it will start receiving the 4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This instrument, in which the promised 4 billion are not in credit, can cause a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Violent Hackers and Diligent Spys
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems to be a scandal against the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound international changes and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by a secret service (independent of the nation to which it belongs) is formed exclusively by press cuts.
The "extraordinary" U.S. revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits reflect only what has been written in any newspaper for months (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's synistically ridiculous profile has long given cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret records must only be made up of public knowledge news is essential to the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of the occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism not only trust what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is pessimistic, just as it is pessimistic (or is of little concern) the chief of secret services (if it could not be, what I know, editor of the Liberation), who only considers what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that sent the US Embassy from Rome to the State Department was the same as it published the Newsweek last week.
Then why have the revelations of these records caused such a revelation?
On the one hand, they only say what any cultivated person already knows, i.e. that embassies, at least since World War II and since Heads of State can be called by phone or catch the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have become spy centers.
Any viewer who sees research films knows it perfectly, we just seem not to know it because of hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact that it is repeated publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of US diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the secrets of the world's most powerful country significantly affects the prestige of the Department of State.
Therefore, the scandal affects both victims and "virtues".
But we enter into the true nature of what has happened.
In ancient times, in Orwell's time, it could be conceived to all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, by controlling each movement thanks to the phone, every transaction performed, visited hotel, autopath taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it turns out, as it happens now, that even the encryptions of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, elected as the revenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be sustained that can no longer keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks didn't hurt Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused by such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to place any reserved information on the network, as it would be like publishing it on a billboard in the street.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, it is not possible to expect to keep confidential conversations by phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State has moved on board and contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly that, for the time being, my prediction is science fiction and, therefore, novelty, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly into diligences with uncontrollable routes, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, like many, hiding some data written in the pockets of their shoes.
This information is then preserved, in a single copy, in locked drawers with key: in the end, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently moving forward as a cane, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has created a telegraph with cables (phones).
Video tapes (analogics) had allowed film researchers to study a step by step, moving and coming back, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digitals) only allow to move forward or backward from chapter in chapter, i.e. to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, with the displacements it carries, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing but normal that communication policy and techniques take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In ancient times, the press tried to understand what was secretly being done in the embassies.
At present, they are the embassies who ask for confidential information to the press.
Climate: the French hoods in their financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked financing promises (called start-up or early) made by the developed countries have been met.
And the French hoods have been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed themselves to providing $3 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed itself to EUR 7,200 million in three years and France EUR 1,260 million (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to the fast-start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press wheel, a large complementary event, the distribution of leaflets...
The transparency operation was a tangible result and was appreciated as it really was: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2,200 million in 2010, which puts it on the right track towards fulfilling its commitment of EUR 7,200 million in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each one chooses the reference that most suits him.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million in three years are added to the concept of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with respect to the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, France's total amount of aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while it intends to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no norm and each one chooses the calculation method.
Some, like France, believe that each euro lent is equivalent to a given euro.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is a mistake to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... As much, only the cost of the loan should be calculated for its commitments for the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent of a type of interest).
However, France does not find such reasoning useful: "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million); consult the EU document to see it from its own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so often.
Germany uses it in 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, inter alia, comply with its commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes a euro to meet its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast-start financing, France commits double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions in time and on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, you get the impression that you spend 420 million "new and additional", as you promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has been involved in arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why did the other Member States continue to give when they can just lend) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not stupid...
The early financing chapter is a small, relatively short-term, relative to the overall climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra sand grains in the enormous machinery that is the CNUC.
Let's hope it's not like that.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with a view to respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
However, France could in particular make the debate on long-term financing bets progress (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive about this issue as it is with others.
We therefore hope that the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Koscisko-Morizet, will arrive at Cancún next week.
A surprising announcement on France's fast start and its vision of the "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the negotiations.
Warning on pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingeste 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Generations Futures Association (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", acquired in Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September the foods that are usually consumed by a child of about ten years in four meals and a tentacles per day.
These foods taken as a model, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as golosins, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable cancers and five are classified as safe cancers, as well as 37 substances that are likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to the studies of various institutions such as the International Research Centre on Cancer.
"Although in almost all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying," says the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic wastes and three considered safe carcinogenics, as well as close to twenty residues that may harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, is intended as a spring for college, contains traces of six chemicals, including a prohibited fungicide in France.
The same applies to the green Jews of Kenya, including in food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian wire, the bluefin tuna, and even the bread bar or chicle were glued with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water of the graffiti, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
In the dinner, the salmon wheel was the most "nutrative" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that these "contaminants cocktails" generate for the consumer is "probably underestimated", says the study.
The European Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "to address the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
