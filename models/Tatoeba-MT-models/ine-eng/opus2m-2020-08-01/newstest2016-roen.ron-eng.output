UN chief states there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that lasts nearly five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again asked all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present in the Council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - at the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and the regional authorities "have made this situation unresolved".
Ban has asked the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity when they managed to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 poll figures showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a flip-flop politician.
Others called him a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to give Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed that Donald Trump is driving a percent of the two numbers, and some voices are starting to wonder what this means for the names of the real estate.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of them say Trump will win the race for nominating the Republicans.
Pundits shows that in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance took place to Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination process.
And the reasons why it would be hard to fight in general elections are numerous.
But external groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative Club for Growth support Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Next we present a few figures from recent surveys that suggest that the real estate is not just something transitory:
The figures that indicate support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
In early August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favourable opinion on Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 says they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the Republicans in the region have a favourable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiasmed" or "thank you" if Trump would win the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 states that it would be "ruined" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be "enthusiasmed" towards 40% that says the same thing about Trump).
The closest to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters claim that they would be "unthankful" or "disappear" if the favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temperament a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticised for his offensives and his bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters at the national level believe that the real estate has the right temperament to be president, according to the poll conducted on Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We get the same figures in Iowa, where 52% of the Republicans think Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to a survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% feel that he does not have the personality needed to act efficiently and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temper has nothing to do with the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When I take the intellectual attitude, Republican voters think Trump is authentic.
According to a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, four out of 10 said Trump had the most chance of winning the GOP nomination race.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 were betting on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters have not read very well the future.
In the same period of the last elections, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the nomination process, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign to be plausible.
Even if the Republicans or rebuffed to another candidate, the Trump is still in front of everyone.
Some voices say that the split situation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while supporting Trump's opposition will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
However, a survey conducted at the beginning of September at the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of cooperation between Trump and the majority of other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and finally 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation from one to the other.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new survey conducted on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of the voters who support Trump declare that they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this sense and no one can say that they will never change.
46% say it leaves the door open to change its option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is now neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely that voters who declare that they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say I agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "violators" in his campaign opening two months ago, immigration was the main topic in the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombing style will lead to a rift between important Spanish voters and the Republican Party and prejudice the rebranding efforts.
However, according to a survey conducted Monday by ABC/Post, six of the 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as the immigration problem remains in the light of reflectors, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration against authorities reaches new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of the Republican voters, largely because of their foreign status.
According to a survey conducted Monday by ABC/Post, six of the 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government.
People are also angry with the Washington authorities.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the Congressional Republicans, 54% being declared "unthank you" and 21% being "anxious".
Jeremy Corbyn starts with Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's start to PMQs has long been expected
The new leader of the Laborist Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later begin at Prime Minister's Questions, confronting David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he has the right to shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be analysed almost by mass media and Labour Parliamentarians.
As part of his weekly appearances, he called for "less theatre and more facts".
He also said he could give up some of his participations and give up on his colleagues.
The conference will be Mr. Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after he called a "phantom cabinet" and after the speech he gave on Tuesday at the annual TUC Congress.
In the meantime, the leader of the Labour Party's decision to keep silent about the birth of the national anthem in a job held in March on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted critics from conservative parliamentarians and held the first page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesperson for Mr. Corbyn said that he "kept quiet respectfully" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Forces in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight broadcast that he would have recommended the Labour Leader to sing the national name "individual" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers from the phantom cabinet refused to be part of Mr. Corbyn's front team, arguing by differences of opinion on the economy, defence and external, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant states that the political differences are "cumulative" in the Labour Party after calling Mr Corbyn on his position towards the European Union and limited benefits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would bring about changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the "head" level from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labourer leader David Cameron faced in the court in the last decade, since he took the lead of the Conservative Party.
The Laborist leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from external sources" for questions to address to Mr Cameron and that he has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
Parliament member Islington North said that PMQs involves too high a level of confrontation and that it will refrain from replicating and attacking, seeking to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the Finance Minister, will hold office at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr. Cameron is moving abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor on an occasional basis, saying that he had approached the President of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" associated with PMQs, but he often recognized a few years later that he did not succeed in his career.
Since the first broadcast, in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how he runs the House of Deputies and his position among parliamentary colleagues, although the criticism has become a cartoon and that he needs a deep reform.
"Frame in Joburg": Teens without shelter benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and win their life.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young people without shelter to take pictures of the areas where they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could damage extensions
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, states that an increase in the minimum wage in Britain could mean "a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, it is unlikely that that purchasing power will exceed the higher costs for the labour force within the company, he states.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Dennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserved to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the "turtuna" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgyz, and his behavior deserves better words of praise and not criticism, in the opinion of President Dennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest part of the gifted duo often called "Special Ks", was unsatisfied in the light of the reflectors by the scandalous side of Kyrgyz against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a quaint match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair arbitrator had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after Harrison said: “Wawrinka should have put Kyrgyz on the ground, and I should have put him on the ground in this child.”
Although he was last seen doing a dust rocket after having had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, upset Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The adolescent is currently in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the place two individually, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
"One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little into conflict," Healy said.
The truth is, he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused the US of crashing, but he's not the first player to break a rocket in frustration against himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But to be serious, he was very well mastered in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He's got an extraordinary team, he's got a great family together, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He is a 19-year-old very mature young man who works hard and has joined the team, has had no kind of conflict with other players, is very respected in dress, is trained hard, is in an excellent form, is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and weaknesses.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgyz into account for the important rebate game, which begins on Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most appropriate for all, but supported the return of the player from Canberra in the long term in the team.
"First of all, we want the team to concentrate fully on the surrender game and not think about the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick came up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he's matured under the public eye and made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs a time when he's not in the center of attention to be able to reflect, good work for both the team and for him.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders has been reduced to half in national surveys
The former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the field.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is in place two, with 27% (up against 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not announced yet if he is to run for the presidency, is supported by 15% of the democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than the supporters of other candidates.
In front of the CBS survey last month, Clinton lost land in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among men has decreased considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among the democratic electors under the age of 50 has evaporated, now at the same time as Sanders.
Still, Clinton is still in favour of the elderly electors.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures, among the liberals, but Sanders now has a slight advantage of 5 points in this group.
Approximately half of democratic voters at the national level declare that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if he were chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support a somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are excited about its choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed up among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48% of the democratic voters declare that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the number of Republican voters who declare the same about the first class is lower, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility is also mentioned.
Given that the Vice-President is considering a possible candidate for the presidency, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him running - although a third I do not think he should run.
On the question of the second option for the party representative, democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half said Biden would be the second option, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders grows from 20 points to 30 points if he doesn't.
55% of the democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the highest chance to win general elections; however, the figures have dropped from 78% last month.
Biden is at a distance in two places, but the percentage according to which it is the most eligible has grown.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic or possibly candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential run.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are well dealt with in terms of several key features of their party's primary voters.
Most electors consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trust and have solid leadership qualities.
Biden is the best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of the democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is complete and reliable, twice as much as those who declare this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion on him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally consider that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
Regarding all these aspects, approximately a quarter of the democratic voters do not have an opinion on Sanders.
As questions persist regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton when he was Secretary of State, the majority of the voters are grateful for his explanation on the subject and say that he did not affect the general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different for the American public.
Half of the Americans are unhappy with her explanation now, while only about a third are happy.
The public opinion was divided into March on this subject, shortly after the issue came to an end.
The majority of Americans say that that email-related controversy did not affect their general opinion about Clinton, although 36% said they had changed their opinion in a negative way.
Most Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative way.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton to be complete and reliable, this issue continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider it to be complete and reliable, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it to be integral and confidential.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not consider Trump to be complete and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Among the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush are first classified as regards integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders to be integral is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, however, as in Carson's case, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the 351 primary democratic voters sample is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the group accused of killing a student in the year 1 at the Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Poconi Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
The members of the Brotherhood Pi Delta Psi of the Baruch Faculty in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a ritual of initiation in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, put behind him a 14 kg backpack full of sand and was repeatedly kicked while trying to turn to a target, on a frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused of headaches after which he lost his knowledge.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood didn't call the emergency number after he left and pretended to have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, the police say.
But they found the time to change Deng's clothes, search Google for his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the president of the nationwide brotherhood, to ask for his advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide personal property and put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng's well-being," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the second day of the morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to his head, trunks and thighs.
"Many families have been devastated by friar rituals since 1970, at least one student has lost his life every year because of rituals," Douglas Fierberg, Deng's lawyer, said in a statement.
Their brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe has recommended that the first five members be charged with three counts of murder.
Other thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with ultraj and complicated crime.
"We want to take responsibility not only for the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the frat, whether official or informal, we will also take responsibility," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch's faculty banned the Fraternity and the National Fraternity withdrew its membership with local representation.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve increases the interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (the growing market) will grow, the profitability of bonds will increase and the economy will enter into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In the economy, history provides little indication of time frame..
After the first increase in the interest rate, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy responds and the financial assets.
Therefore, the US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on the time when the interest rate begins to increase but on the time period needed to normalise.
Indeed, there are multiple variables in the game.
However, in the end, market players could find that all the excitement associated with the increase in the interest rate was exaggerated.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will be inevitably interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era of "cheaps," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but it is still small to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
However, it cannot be said that there will be no effect.
We continue to present how several sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
In view of the situation that the market has been facing in recent months, the anticipation of growth in the interest rate can fluctuate things for a while.
However, at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for capital profitability to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may reflect the flaw in monetary policy," analysts Deutsche Bank said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed growth.
More precisely, over the last 35 years, the market has grown rapidly - with about 14 percent - towards rising the rate of interest, fairly invariable over 250 days after (average 2.6%) after it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the head of Nuveen Asset Management strategy.
Deutsche said that the impact on actions tends to become more pronounced later in the growth cycle of the interest rate and the benefits begin to drop.
The recession is a reality of economic life, but increasing the rate of earnings often contributes to it.
In the face of the situation, the Fed faces conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
More precisely, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in the Fed's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, nominal GDP was only twice as low as 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, little is expected to continue, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in the rate of earnings in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing themselves all year round for a decision to grow by the Fed, and all eyes are focused on meeting this week of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends Thursday.
Although numerous strategies and economists are of the opinion that the WTO could approve an increase in the interest rate on the occasion of this meeting, transactions in the term indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study carried out after 1950, all the growth cycles of the interest rate so far have been in a super-profit growth cycle, emphasizing the peaks before the very rapid recession after the start of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strange slow recovery after the most severe recession of the period analyzed.
The current cycle is far longer expected by Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months old, and it reached 74 months and continues.
The fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the figure is somewhat similar to that of the dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of obligations than in the case of actions when Fed changes policy.
In the case of obligations, the benefits appear to change direction as soon as the first growth/decreasing occurs.
At the end of the growth cycle of the interest rate, the profitability of bonds is falling immediately," Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategies are of the opinion that these growths in the interest rate will determine the proximity of profitability between short-term obligations and long-term obligations, phasing out the curve.
High-efficiency bonds are better managed in such an environment, although "we are still careful about strengthening profitability", said Kathy Jones, a regular income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that markets have already adapted to Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the estimated fall in inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more stringent monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have grown, the profitability curve is more right, the spread of the average interest rate of credit has expanded and volatility has increased - all market features when the Fed is political.
In large lines, companies that carry out their majority activity in the United States will have to earn as a result of the increase in the rate of earnings and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the increase in the dollar will lead to the accumulation of their products in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality stocks" tend to be more profitable in the next three months of an initial increase in the interest rate," analyst Goldman Sachs said in a report to customers.
Strong-balance-sheet companies exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases of 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital deposits and low-volatility stocks also exceeded similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will become an important problem.
Companies with a large percentage of floating debts have the most to lose, says Goldman.
Consumers will also have gained from the increase in the dollar.
Economists could also have won, although experts do not agree on how soon this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy by Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the radio post for "prossing"
He says he's becoming more and more like the commercial opponent.
He also took into consideration BBC Music Awards, claiming that Britain's awards have been placid
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that neither this show was original
BBC Radio 3 is "converting into" Classic FM, an important parliamentary said, putting pressure on the post to prove that it does something that commercial posts don't do.
Conservative Parliamentarian Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public radio post "pross" and resembles the commercial opponent.
"I have the impression that Radio 3 "simplyses" - although I don't like to use the word - but I have the impression that it turns into Classic FM," he said.
He also took into account BBC Music Awards, released last December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seems to be Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to my mind that I'm just trying to copy what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director General of the BBC has denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is very much in front of its commercial opponent regarding live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anything about classical music I find on Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important to commit Radio 3 to discover new music and assign new songs," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC editor Radio 3, Alan Davey, said he had to make more efforts to attract the audience from the previous period because the British have less knowledge about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only item under the BBC's seal that was criticised in the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Mass Media and Sport for pursuing its trade rivals.
Conservative Parliamentarian Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC-bought talent show by Dutch producer Talpa Media for about 22 million pounds sterling.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the show by BBC1 - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in jury - be performed "in a specific way to BBC."
He added that he wanted that Corporation to "find chicken with gold eggs in its own garden" next time when he launched a entertainment show.
However, he refused to forbid the future to take over new seasons from The Voice or to spend money on licenses in other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August and guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales grew by 7%.
In the last month, the slowest growth from 2000 to now has been recorded.
Online sales went well three years ago, due to the use of mobile phones to make purchases.
Experts are of the opinion that Black Friday in November could determine the cost-resistance.
For over a decade, online purchases have exploded and turned commercial streets from Britain into ghost cities.
Experts say, however, that there are signs that online sales are falling, the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total amount of money spent in August has shown the lowest growth from 2000 to now, with only a 5% increase in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are falling, the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we analyze the growth rate from previous years and return by 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalise over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMG Sales Index, told Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when buyers started using the mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could make online purchases and could do it under different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it stagnates a little, you may notice a decrease (in growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers froze in front of computers to put their hands on offers, leading to the collapse of the sites of more detail.
Experts are of the opinion that Black Friday, when buyers have beaten the chilipers, could determine the buyer's refusal.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that at least 1 £ out of every 5 £ is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people prefer to buy online clothes and shoes than to appeal to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the Bin Laden family's sanctions, Muslims bury the victims killed after the macara crash in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked on Muslim streets, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially defeated the giant in the construction of Saudi Binladin Group for collapse.
Health Minister said a total of 394 people were injured as a result of the collapse of the macarala
In the street walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macaral that collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, the mourners joined the road to express their condolences, until the first death came at the end of the final journey, at Al-Moasisse cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where only a few days ago a macaroni fell through the mosque roof, falling on believers.
The bodies were released for the funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the construction group of the bin Laden family for disaster, which also fought 394 wounded.
In the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macaral that collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of the four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, found in his first pilgrimage when the macaraca collapsed.
Mr. Akram is in the Moschee Sea with his parents before the beginning of the annual pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still reaching the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the mask arm up when the mask was not in operation.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said that the Binladin Group is partly guilty of corruption.
The news agency's English service did not present that detail, but said that the company's leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the collapse of the macara in the Moschei court, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Haj pilgrimage that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the macaroni and the Group's representatives have not been able to be contacted for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated security measures and did not coordinate its activities with the meteorological authorities.
Ten of the macarals surrounding the Mecca Sea, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is conducting major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegotiated" son, disassociated by family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in conditions of strong wind and rain, with only a few days before millions of people in the kingdom arrived to participate in the pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the life of every Muslim fit physically.
The authorities declare that 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased would receive a million Saudi Rials (174,000 pounds) and the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
The advantages and disadvantages of converting loans into Swiss francs
On the banking market, there have already been two bids for converting loans into Swiss francs, the main advantages being excluding the currency risk and reducing the rates.
The disadvantages can come over a few years, when the variable charge can lead to increased rates.
The Transylvania Bank has just completed the process of converting loans into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bankpost has announced an offer of conversion for its customers.
According to the accumulated data from FinZoom financial portal analysts, Bankpost offers three years of fixed fee to the lowest of 1.5% on the market.
On the other hand, the transfer offer of the Transylvania Bank was accepted by 83% of the customers with franc credits due to the second successive reduction: the balance was reduced by the value of the risk and administration commissions paid by the client, then an additional 22.5% reduction was applied to the balance in milk.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, the girl who paid a monthly equivalent in milk before conversion.
Thus, the Transylvania Bank reduces the rate by 42.5% and the Bank Post by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Beneficiaries
The main advantage of the credit coverage in the CHF is to eliminate the currency risk, the consumer being protected from the future increases of the franc, and the credit refund will be made in the currency in which the salary is paid.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that property reevaluation is not done, additional guarantees are no longer required and another proof of revenue.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing agent.
Both banks also provide a reduction to the monthly rate, the girl who paid the customers before the conversion, equivalent to in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is more of a payout and the customer refunds very little of the principal.
The Bankpost offer with very little payout in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
But it's not known how this doll will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is less.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable bond is that ROBOR indexes will grow significantly in the following years (more than Libor indexes – CHF).
For example, ROBOR in three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to raise other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for decisions on the interest rate for the US Federal Reserve
The world is looking forward to the scheduled meeting over two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make a crucial decision whether to increase or not the interest rate for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with 80 economists, a little over half last week thought the decision would be taken, now I think the situation will be maintained for a while and that interest rates will be maintained in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we face a situation where a major central bank could give up on the zero rate and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, restoring trillions of dollars in the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the global situation less pink.
He warned the markets to prepare for an increase, but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
See who lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 she struggled with leukemia and lost her partner in 2009 to cancer, Farrah Fawcett.
It is also announced that the actor would have faced the problem of drug use and that in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of these certainly have a cost.
The player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is on the boat for a few months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture at the right foot in the game played by Manchester United in the Champions League, ended with a defeat in front of the Swiss Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears into the player's eyes and that will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred following an unscrupulous intervention by Héctor Moreno in 15 minutes, after Shaw, 20 years of age, broke the PSV defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he went to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture at his feet and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe spring then he'll be operating in Manchester.
It's horrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, it happens hard, then it plays fantastic and now it happens.
He's got his oxygen mask in his dressing room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but in a double fracture the rest is six months and won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped from the red card and the concession of a punishment strike.
Arbitrary Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge yourself when I say it's falsified and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly intervention, with two legs.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, start the way to recovery, I will return stronger."
Similar news: Manchester United hit by the accident of Luke Shaw in the defeat of PSV
The foundation of the English team has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, coach PSV, said: "It's a very ugly accident."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never want to happen to an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico's national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal to the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very difficult because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious accident, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the stage.
I managed to see only the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched her but I could not see the intervention on Luke.
In the statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it is, I know how difficult it is to go through this.
I feel bad. I'm so sorry.
The PSV player, Andrés Guardado, also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's mission, but still remains strong
The victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, however, after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not take into account a repeat of the 3-0 collision in the test matches.
I wouldn't remove any variant of a moving victory.
The Alastair Cook team may have less experience than three years ago, but has good spin players in the batting line and collective morality is strong; they will not be marked by 2012 events and will have a positive youth attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even though he is unknown at the test level, represents an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left the English team for test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his principal coach in Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven test games against two good attackers, in difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no questions about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said this before - the players are their own selections.
Some fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope if he does more runs for Yorkshire he'll have other opportunities.
The leading coach of the team of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised her attitude even when performance was not as big as his ability and I'm not surprised by this; first of all, he's a team man.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs--like Sam Robson before he--while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had luck at home and on his way.
The only disappointment you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in the highest form - but that missed occasion is the area of the past.
The team's got Alex Hales, a batsman I'm quoting very well.
He's a cricket player who has "factor X" and we noticed early on Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a pitch Trent Bridge.
They should be given at least the same opportunity as those before them, but this will certainly depend on the membership of the UAE team.
The idea of opening Moeen to battle alongside Cook was launched, which would lead an extra spinner at the same time keeping four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a thrower couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be fucking.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success in his district, Worcestershire, but it was number 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games test 38 as first drop before opening in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team at the back-up spinner post and, although I had a limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his fragile age - with an average of 31 in battle and 35 in ball - and they might think it's a point, but there's no bunch of spinners, and the pickers opted for youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has also made some changes to the training team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman in Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master's hit.
It is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that it has played in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and unscrupulous ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the newsroom, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring fresh air into the team.
Colly Durham's coach, Ben Stokes is resting for one day's games, Root got a similar break against Australia, and I don't have a problem with this.
Although not all are in agreement, coaches and selections do not do the program.
And you have to hold on, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never easy.
The Brexit Camp could have a profit if the economy is kept in acalmy until 2017
Every day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse, even without the choice of genius Jeremy "Yes or no"? Corbyn led the Labour Party or TUC to bring serious criticism Tuesday towards Europe.
Foreigners also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained last day that - buried in crises similar to those in the EU - not all are provoked internally - some Member States are fed on the UK's agenda for concessions and amendments to treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they would not want to do so if social protection were to be eroded.
We could even call Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The prime minister and the chancellor participate in summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a photo in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with a view to the outside under the EU umbrella - "Do not leave us alone with France," Berlin says - suggests that several ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor of extreme care, is an ally who has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation gets worse, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too much.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be real or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who shoot, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from coming out of Britain - something they don't even want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to make deliberate remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"Renegotiation has been fixed" and "the Great Britain has obtained nothing of value from renegotiation".
Europeans know on their skin how plausible Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the Barons are from the oligarchic press that look at the EU with skepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry into report 2:1.
I may recall Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a Brussels correspondent.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture of unpaid tax bags, foreign people who were cheating on telephone and pseudo non-homes who owned most of the important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them kind of the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give them bananas to distract them from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair in the opposition to Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of an abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which offered him a exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who has touched my friendship on the back of the month at Westminster - I told him not to spend his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting the Murdoch boycott strategy of Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take a long time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of media cooperation, not with me, but with sure Andrew Marr whose position on the BBC left a Sunday vacation.
Corbyn's official position in front of Europe is what I would call evolution with indulgence.
It states that it would like to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who do not agree with the "englistism" of the Conservatives might agree with that.
This was said by Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher from him fought not to acknowledge that John McDonnell's appointment by Corbyn as a "shadow" minister on financial problems was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 1970s when his father fought on TV to be unfaithful to his lab colleagues, without going too far and without losing his office.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said and to what JC told colleagues and parliamentarians during the private meeting last night.
Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to transmit - you hold on, he sensitized me too - the discipline of the messages remains important in the television age and especially in the social media circle, a flame of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a favour card in Europe, allowing him to take good support from the laborers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
However, McDonnell and Corbyin's basic sophism about EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophiism about NATO - Tom Watson is reluctant about the fact that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin be ashamed of political capital - and there are suspected voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed about the weak military performance of the Englishmen in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded of the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them linked to tobacco industry.
Experts from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the publication Launched in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as "a complex analysis of the evidence".
Several researchers, however, questioned the data robustness and showed finger to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the "extraordinary fragility base" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in BMJ have put their claims and their foundation "on solid ground or moving sand" under the sign of the question.
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They argued that it is expected that the PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision-analysis model (MCDA) that summarised their views on the adverse effects associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research work.
McKee and Capewell either claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director was said to have received funding from the British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.
It also validated BAT's public health accreditation in a sustainability report, it said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the funding received by an electronic cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding that there are reports that it would have been received by the tobacco and tobacco producer company Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided, but among them are a number of "frontiers" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare the financing of the industry.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for the expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting he also participated in the Head of the Control Section for Tobacco within the PHE.
The research work developed by the group "mussamalizes convincingly" lacks "solid evidence of the harmful effect most products have on the majority of the criteria," said McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said the PHE claims that "to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the Department of Health at the PHE, said he had responded to BMJ's statements in the past.
He said: “Electronic strikes are significantly less harmful than smoking”
One of the two people who have smoked all their life loses his life because of this vice.
All the evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic cigarettes for health is less comparable, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information it collects and that it does not collect from evidence, taking into account in particular the high degree of public confusion regarding the risks relative to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a smoke-related illness and the annual costs of the national health system for smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Expressing clear evidence - and that although the use of electronic cigarettes is not at risk, they represent only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

The cheerful voice and the animated images do not doubt that this claim for the largest world arms trade is an accommodation made by Amnesty International to stress the desire of the British authorities to sell weapons of repression through Defence and Security Equipment International to ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

However, a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posts in bus stations and in subways that need a second look.
"An important announcement, travelling with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the advertisements, using the fonts and branding of the London metro, the DLR line transforming itself into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms trades will be left on DLR Customers are asked to contribute to stopping the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-litre Allen key package that states that "make access to approximately a third of the advertising space of bus stations on the planet easier."
The transport of London is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of flyers.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists ask more and more questions and seek to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists turn to collaborating with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go into the real world to have their art impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that happens to shipmen running the subway.
The film by Amnesty had over 100,000 Facebook views in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP who worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
VCCP's creation director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the advertising for the arms trade - with an empty space in ExCel's calendar - and thought, "Let's offer a campaign that tries to avoid it."
They have played with making a more realistic ad, but "richening it with strong animations and colors, it was more exciting".
"They did a great job helping us increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment in the marketplace," said Tom Davies, Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take measures and ensure that torture equipment is not marketed illegally and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the subject of the arms trade comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic eufemistic products.
In a press release, Saab released an order received from the U.S. Army about "AT4CS RS with shoulder support launcher."
This includes “a single-shaped focus that provides devastating effects behind the armor within the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules to live in the home
It's been 11 years since I moved into my home, when I was a 19-year-old, who still believed in beer and moral relativity, but now I remember the strong smiles of those we were angry with - and the many complaints to others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summarized in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring states that vary from nervous to terrible.
It's tempting to tell people where you're from, if and where you've spent a year studying break, what you think about Corbyn and why "you really care about Marmite because, in good boys, it's nothing but a HAHAA droid extract, you find me in my room."
Breathe deep.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
They encourage the conversation and help you to differentiate the people you like from who you wouldn't talk to even if the crowd came and they'd be the only ones who would have boats.
Don't choke people.
Sleepers often have plenty of parties with drinks, film series and socialization meetings, but they are also where people dress and try their intimate lingerie.
Similar subjects: Don’t even think about starting a student’s life in a relationship
Introverts are part of special treatment at the university.
Your sleeper should be a refugee, but in many homes a perindation culture is built through bedrooms, based on friendship, socialization and friends who spend their whole life.
All of this can be terrible for someone who's trying to charge his batteries.
None of this culture allows you to say "I like you and I want to stay friends but I want you to leave to recover my energy I consumed by interacting with you."
Try to intercept when a colleague is out socialized - and try sending an SMS instead of knocking at the door.
When it comes to knocking at the door: do it.
A guy who was sitting in the same house with me had a policy that said if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited to come in.
He's seen enough things.
Make your friends cooking.
Given that you're starting college in the Bake-Off fever, if you knock at someone's door to get to know and drive and a black paint, it seems less strange, less kind of the situation in the 1950s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've prepared something for you, now smiles and I ask personal questions."
The goodness prepared in the house is a great way to make you friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to sit down and may be able to associate your figure with a pleasant surprise.
Obviously, you have to be a good cook.
Cocoons of flour, sugar and fat will most likely determine others to pretend to sleep when you knock at the door.
The burden of food is a frequent crime in the student homes.
Obviously, if you wipe someone's chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put it in your tea is all stolen?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to serve yourself even if he's burning inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I understand you - still try to address the problem more mature than my roommate, who has dyed her milk with liquid detergent to punish those who have stolen.
Now he's in jail.
Do not make noises that do not let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it makes you feel good, it's because you're going to your own business.
A girl from the palace with me asked her neighbor to give the music more slowly because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to give more music.
When they stopped the music in a final, at 5 a.m., the girl was friendly and let them sleep two hours before going to maximum music, locked the door and went to the exam that lasted three hours.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the next husband/the next wife moved on the same floor?
On the contrary, it wouldn't be very strange if you confused a palier with your future husband, you got a couple, you split up and you should meet each other every day and maybe even see him meet all the common friends?
Of course, you can't resist your heart - but if a sexy palier colleague is certainly not your future husband, try to be rational at least.
The moment you realize that someone left his keys in his room unscathed, the line between farce and intimidation is thinner than it seems.
A successful farce is fun, but it can damage in a few minutes.
Teach a fun and valuable safety-related lesson by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you pour into the freezer - but you don't glue someone's goods to the ceiling more than twice.
Violent David Grimal: There were no world tournaments in Bach’s day.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as soloist but also as the initiator of a less common project, of the "stranged" right, as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra formed by international soloists and talented musicians, who interprets a symphonic repertoire without having a director, and that makes it at least one curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two shows: a performance, Sunday, in which soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when first-hand cellist Xavier Phillips was found, the works made by Enescu were undisputed.
Both performances, worn out on the scene of Athens, showed the audience another way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the musical stage in 2004 and at that time was the only classical musical set in which there was no director.
The director is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the part of musicians, they need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - they speak of instrumentalists, not composers.
They're trained as "specialized workers."
They institute the impression that they need a director.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all the music fetissing focuses on the director.
And so, business, the music industry, it's marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So if we look at this world, we have qualified workers on one side, which is stupid, and a public who can't listen, but must look, which is stupid again," says David Grimal.
The violinist tells how this change in the way music makes music came after "musical disappointments" in his soloist career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money and the music industry.
After 10 years, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because we no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So, I've found no sense of continuing on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one would do such a thing without a director: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects".
"How do I imagine you're marketing with a band of musicians where there's no ego anymore?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonates is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the whole, the absence of a director did not prove to be a pedigree in the musical act: "In a curious way, as we sang a more complex repertoire, it seems easier, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role," says Grimal, adding that at Sunday's show "I was 74 directors on stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", just because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where there are the largest orchestras in the world singing and 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you have also invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest for something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist admits that he feels the Roman music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "for there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal's campaign to change the way classical music education is made, considering that "the mass of musicians, as it is organized today, has an ice of death" and that "the future of music represents insatiable music".
We don't need to make the world tour five times a year if it's not for anything.
There were no world tournaments in Bach's day.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albums, are all great, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the music service.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal set an example for Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had vegetables and good meat".
In order to enter the EU, it was necessary to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture come into the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
Music happens the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes roses may not be too beautiful, but when we cut them are real roses.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system should understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as the Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things in humanity, we will reintroduce its learning in school, reintroduce the concerts on television, and by this education we will no longer need to sell music by-products," Grimal thinks.
Surely there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, this all over the world, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's all something else.
After your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist Zambind.
Grimal looks like, for artists, the reward of another kind of making music comes just from exceeding this status of "soldier", the transcendence of what "they think are their limits": "The musicians discover in a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and therefore after the concert they come out of the vermins."
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and his vision of music and the artist at the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.

Cinema City is looking for "Middle Voci Mari"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: double two characters in the super-production "Creation 3D"
Do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Offer him the chance to get to see.
In September, during the latest campaigns dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years of age, Cinema City is looking for "Milie Voci Mari", offering them an extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animation film.
If classical drawings focus on the actor's voice close to the person's specific character, in the last period, story creation is taken into account and those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that's why we're starting an unpublished campaign.
We want to find the right voice and encourage parents to register their children at our competition.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the replicas are funny.
"Children will have fun and will have a real chance of becoming part of an actor team," said Iona Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, during September 11th - September 30th, Cinema City organizes a selection of 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a test in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the platform minilevocamiari.cinema-city.ro, where to register the child at the competition and prepare it for the voice test.
Later, he has to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will record by interpreting his own version of double.
Four films about friendship, bassm heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the test: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Man: The Guardian of the 3D Moon", "Blinky Bill: The best known 3D Koala" and "Albinutza Maya 3D".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double a few characters in the super-production "The Snow Queen - The 3D Crayfish", which will be the first in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, down tax forecasts for 2016
FedEx has stated disappointing results for the last quarter, the giant in the field of deliveries, reducing profit estimates throughout the year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its terrestrial transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares decreased by approximately 2.5% in the pre-market transaction, 45 minutes before the opening bell on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that it is expected to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of the following year, with 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts suggested a $10.84 figure, according to a FactSet survey.
The down estimate is despite an increase in prices of 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and larger overtaxes for the land transport of large or large packages, which will apply from November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase its profits from the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
The president and Director General Fred Smith said that "the company is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than is expected, especially with regard to production and global trade."
The employment plans during the holidays were announced one day after the UPS competitor stated that it intends to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of jobs she made last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than last year.
The stakes were $2.42, under an average estimate of $2.44 per stake made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit grew by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated the amount of $1.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to the stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online purchases led to the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the incomes of the Ground Division increased by 29%, but operational revenues have practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher base rates, while the revenues recorded by the freight division decreased due to rising costs.
At the pre-market transaction, approximately an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares decreased by $3.85 or 2.5%, at $150.15.
Tuesday at low closing with 11% at year level and 17% at maximum record recorded on 11 June.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meeting in recent years, those responsible for developing federal reserve policies will spend two days this week around a 27-foot table of Mahon Honduran to decide whether the time has come to increase a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at the end of the Central Bank's sitting room, a wall painting will be maintained in the United States.
The map is intended to remind that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Fed, and her colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above anything.
The Central Bank has received a double task from Congress: maximising the employment rate in the US and maintaining price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, the Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is prepared to be disbanded by the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in effect from the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a strong growth economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already careful about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only a quarter of a point.
"Evidently, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects to be pursued," said Lindsey M. Piezza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they were to seek an excuse not to increase the interest rate, uncertainty in growth on the world market is enough to provide them with arguments to expect more," he said.
There is no consensus on the decision that the Fed will take, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
Approximately half of the recent economists questioned by Bloomberg anticipated an increase in the rate of earnings this week.
However, financial markets are expected to slow down Fed, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a decline in the stock exchange if the Fed were to increase the interest rate, except where policymakers would slow down the impact by promising that it would go a long way to the next growth.
On Tuesday, industrial media Dow Jones raised 228.89 points, or 1.4%, up to 16,599,85.
Advantage was sparked by expectations that the Fed decision factors will maintain stable earnings rate this week, said John Lonski, the economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if Fed would increase the rate of earnings at this time," Lonski said.
If the Fed decision-makers do this, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets".
Other experts have said that an increase in the interest rate would calm down the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slow recovery of monetary conditions that would confirm the US recovery force.
Yelena said in spring and early summer that she was expecting an increase in the rate of earnings this year despite the objections raised by the liberals as if more economic progress were needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth was strong this year.
The unemployment rate decreased to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Wages presented signs of growth.
And although inflation has continued to not reach the central bank's annual target, the Fed decision factors have stated that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil prices found in a sudden decline.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, global financial markets began to go into fibrillations at the end of this month, after China has devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial medium dropped by 16% under the highest record reached in May, as investors feared that slowing the Chinese economy would bring global growth down.
The market has declined somewhat this month, the Dow indices are now about 10% below the maximum in May.
For the Fed decision factors, the market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the rate of growth of the interest rate.
"Without what happened on the financial markets and news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in the last weeks, it would be more firm in the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher in UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and was officially Fed.
Now, he suggests they'll wait at least a month to manage the effects better.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about which will be the impact on the US economy and almost have no data based on further events in China," Oliner said.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so it should practically not be taken into account in making decisions.
However, in reality, Fed has become a global monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
The President's simple argument since then, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Fed could "injugate" its monetary expansion has triggered a global shock on markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it is to be expected that Fed officials not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, head of the Global Strategy Department of the Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Laker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said this month that "The Fed has an oversized reaction story to changes in the financial market that seem to have nothing to do with economic bases."
Laker, a member with the right to vote of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported the increase in the rate of pay, offered as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis that affected Asia has led the Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "in spite of the implications of limited identification for US development," Laker said.
A year later, the Fed officials came back to that decline.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crisis, Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting commission said.
The last period of agitation is not rising at that level, he said.
"Of course we do not want to get into the situation of fearing an increase in the interest rate because the markets have become angry," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in that sense, I do not think that it should take early action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the attempts by the Nina channel to broadcast today's show about changing party leadership
The urgent movement of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject the consequences of changes from the leadership of the Liberal Party has not brought a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of the Nina channel was broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott was defeated in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The rival show Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was arrested in London as part of a series of broadcasts carried out over the course of several weeks, including Dubai, New York, Niagara and Cancun.
This distance cruise didn't seem to count too much for TV viewers Aussie TV, Sunrise with an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today has seen a slight increase compared to the monthly hearings (317.000) and last March (283,000) but the figures were lower than the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the difference to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
Meanwhile, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
This morning, not only is Parliament affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The main news was the amazing beginning of the 800 Words series by having him as the protagonist on the former star from Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, being the subject of a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thomson was able to do a show on his own without the star of Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
The results of the hearing for last night responded positively that 'yes'.
The show X Factor transmitted by Seven was held in position, with 1,136 million viewers, taking easily from the shows The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, Mihail Hodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of weapons at an airport in Siberia.
Because he provoked President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts were reduced.
4 people lost their lives after the police shot them with rubber bullets in the Nepal protestors
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets in the crowd showing against the country's proposed new constitution, an officer said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital of Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief of the district police, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police section, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas after shooting fires in the air before using rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, were usually used as an alternative to less lethal, caused so many deaths.
The event was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group claim that the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent beatings launched on 10 August,
when four important political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, a centrally ruled country for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was initiated in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, legislators voted the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new card could be adopted on Sunday.

A broad low-pressure front about 560 km south of the southernmost point of Cape Verde is a 60% probability of turning into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Centre said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about half the distance between Cape Verde and Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% probability of forming a tropical cycle over the next two days, the meteorologist in Miami added.
Weight reduction surgery could be useful for mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of weight reduction surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say if obsessive diabetics live more after surgery than those following non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a lot of time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, named and bariatric surgery, use different methods to reduce stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the studies have been conducted in subjects with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (MIC) of 35 or more.
BMI, a weight measurement unit relative to height, is considered normal in range 18.5-24.9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and those with more than 30 BMI are considered obese.
You can calculate the IMC by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used the narrow data after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in mansions - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI in subjects with surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year in the study.
In the meantime, BMI remained close to the same level for those who received non-surgical treatment against diabetes, namely 29.
Among those who have had surgery, diabetes has been completely cured at 36% and partly at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured by only 1% and partly by only 2% of subjects.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol "bad" "was generally better in the surgical group", the authors concluded.
Researchers have also monitored the blood levels of the haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of glucose in time.
Researchers say that the optimal haemoglobin level of A1c is less than 7%.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the group treated with medical methods, approximately 8% remained.
However, this improved "glycemic control" - reflected by improved levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared with the GAST group in mansions, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), recorded significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and A1c haemoglobin (3.1% versus 2.1%) and presented a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on people with heavy weight in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona, the Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who suffered from bariatric surgery presented a probability of dying about 29% less after 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients who had surgery, Blackstone said it was an optimistic aspect for people with BMI below 35 procedural interests.
"This is the point where this work is critical, because it states that this surgical intervention is safe in the lower BMI group," she says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking their BMI seriously when the patient reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long until we ask people to take this aspect seriously," she said.
I think once these genetic changes have been accumulated that have shortened their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader issued an appeal to end the violence in the mother countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current problem of the refugee crisis in the speech she held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of her 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also stressed that although remarkable, the country's response to the refugee crisis in Western Europe is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is just a temporary solution.
"It is a great care for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions to bring peace and genuine development, especially through education, into Muslim countries," he stressed.
In fact, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attacks of 11 September, claiming that the violent US response generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
After the events of 11 September, I sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have been ingested by hand detergents over the last 4 years
According to the Anti-Violence Centre in Georgia, the U.S. Anti-Violence Centres have reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 as regards the number of children under 12 years of age who have swallowed hands detergent with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Anti-Violence Centre in Georgia, cases of ingestion of hand detergent in children under 12 years of age reported to the anti-violence centres rose from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them reach the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children drink deliberately and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
YouTube can be watched movies that present teenagers as drinking detergents to create cheap drinks.
Adolescents seem to have mixed their mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
The younger children can be attracted by the attractive scent of the detergent.
"A child doesn't think he's hurt," says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are perfumed.
Hand detergents with cavities, grapes, oranges are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the cancer center at the University Hospital in Kansas, for channel Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently immigrated to school the equivalent of four powdering hands detergent with cavities aroma, came to the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcohol179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor in the emergency room who treated her at the Medical Gwinnett Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was bluffing and couldn't go when he got to the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a separate child hospital to identify the signs of brain damage, as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
He could've been fatal.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers to use products or services without alcohol and not to leave the hand detergent at the expense of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents were associated with death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing detergent hands containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not alcohol ethyl, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth class in North New York agreed to poison their "bad" teacher "by placing antibacterial products in class", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned it in his gym.
The police considered the plan to be "non-significant" and addressed the disciplinary issue to the school inspector.

The punishment of Adam Rooney for the first time has brought to the Aberdeen a narrow victory in front of those from Hamilton to Pittodrie, Dons getting a difference of five points between them and Celtic.
Griffiths dismantles rumors related to misunderstandings
There have been rumors about misunderstandings in Celtic, disassembled by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure given that they are preparing to confront the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
Absence of the entrants in the race for title makes Dutch - by Boer
The former middle house of Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters lost interest in Celtic - because they didn't fight for the title with Rangers.
From Boer, now Ambassador of the Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands, no longer transmits the summary of the Celtic matches; why?"
Because there aren't Rangers in there.
Here, it's not just about the return of Rangers.
It's about Old Firm.
It's about the two other teams and there's interest.
The tension is high in old firm matches and not just Scottishs want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, she promises.
RONNY Delilah accepted that Celtic is fighting out of dispute, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The battle with Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the battle in front of Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now at the top of the class with a five-point advance.
But Delilah said: "Celtic had periods before and will return."
We want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we need to move on.
We definitely need the support of Celtics because so the players get better.
It's extremely important that we stay together now.
Warburton's plea for transfers from January
Despite the comments just a few weeks ago that suggested that a few targets would be identified for January transfers, the leader of the Rangers, Mark Warburton is concerned when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibrox team.
Brentford's former chief said: "The period of transfers from January is very different from that of summer."
In the case of players transferred in the summer, there is a period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could observe in this season in our group.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes you get worse if you bring players that aren't needed.
Celtic targets Michu after withdrawal
Swansea striker Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he could withdraw at the expiry of the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player has struggled with ice problems for two years and has failed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts faced with SFA regarding Neilson's comments
Hearts drove with 2-1 when Patterson was removed and lost with 3-2, but the red card of the background was cancelled afterwards - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynacastle
The invincible Hibee was heard after he recognized that he sang a song with offensive verses about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," said the striker, adding: "It is no longer necessary to say that I am not going back to Tynacastle unless I play for Celtic."
The Tanadic Council trusts the management of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that those in the Dundee United Council still believe that the management team will change the situation - but it is agreed that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll bring the boys back in form," said Donnellly.
McInnes is happy for "pure victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the team in Aberdeen has to fight with the despair of Hamilton Accies in order to win the seventh consecutive victory in the league, which brought them five points in the Celtic face due to the punishment of Adam Rowey's first coup.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won something, in the cup or league, and that has not won such a match.”
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged as Britain grows
The rate of unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 in May-July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom has grown by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that in Britain, by 5.5%, according to the figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, the employment rate in Scotland has decreased by 12,000 over a period of three months, with the current employment rate of 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell by 74.0% in that quarter - a figure above the average of 73.5 in Britain.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long-term plan of authorities has laid the foundations for a stronger economy".
It's almost fixed a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the employment rate recording growth and the unemployment rate.
Why I'm a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today's day, with the exception of a late legal intervention, I will watch a man sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a room for observers in the State Penitentiary of Oklahoma and I'll see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came the first time in January, through his best friend, and, although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day of dawn approaches, I'm terrified.
So, why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It's true, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because usually the requests exceed the number of available places, there's a macabre lotteries to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The electorate will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I'd stay with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've developed my own relationship with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a book and a pix to notice what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
He tells the prisoner's story as he wants it, he gets access.
I cried to her.
He acknowledged that "it could have been a better formula", but it is still my opinion that I am wrong.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if I asked.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international report to be present to write about the subject.
He thinks if he dies, advertising will help move against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to find out more about the case, listen to the multimedia file series I did.
I'm not coming back here for all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't claim to be totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll know what it's like to look at a man who likes dying useless.
Peter Moody claims that the stewards tried to spy on him and threaten to withdraw from the race
Peter Moody said that the stewards of Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy at his grades last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the Stewars and the Victoria Racing Department of Integrity, claiming that they are carrying out a personal campaign against him, the pit that filled the cup as Lady Daddy was removed from the race because of treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what was best for the course area and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of the Leader's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
He spent 18 months swallowing his words about spy declarations and did not want to look like a "vulpe that doesn't reach grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about it and I've been quiet for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it all comes up all at once," Moody said.
It's known that it continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I'm working with to see that you're trying to give them everything that's best.
From the moment they start to think it doesn't happen that way, I have to give up my coach's job.
At that point, I'm gonna have to think about what I'm gonna do with my certification.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in a given interview for racing.com in which he said the Department of Integrity tried to spy on his grades.
"After eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart stood in a room next to a man - whose name I'll tell him if I'm asked - and offered to hire him at my grades to provide information about the activity there," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course he thinks I'm sad.
If so, then you should give up all because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at that time and know today.
Should I think it's something personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can pull people out of the coaches for what's going on in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on industry?
Is my influence on industry so bad?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I have to take my license and give it to me on one side and I don't doubt that the statements I'm making now could determine to think about this variant.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore and that makes me feel better.
I'm very excited.
I'll put pressure on them and I'll decide to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The frustration of the coach has increased with the long-term investigation into cobalt testing involving Leaders and the elimination has determined that it could "put its license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the unbeatable Black Caviar champion, labeled the treatment of the day of the race as "religical" after applying on the horses' feet a cataplasm with hay or clay, which violates the rules.
He's breaking the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees made a mistake.
It could have happened last night.
Could have happened yesterday, what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could have been disqualified for three months for the course day treatment consisting in the application of the cataplasm, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that there is a need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
The police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by the escape from the scene of the accident.
The biker was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, seriously injured after being hit Saturday morning by a car on Murray Valley highway.
Police representatives say the car driver did not stop to help the injured biker.
Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be charged with escape from the scene of the accident, failure to offer first aid and other road offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, responds to the opponents in the Wrestling charges.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms of his team's investment tactics as "denatured subjects" brought into discussion by the two main NRL favorites.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said the Arbitrators allowed Storm players to "take them to the front" team in Storm's nervously won game at the end of the game last Friday night.
The coach of Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made an easy reference to Storm after the victory of his team in the championship with North Queensland Cowboys, played on Saturday night, when that match called a "demoration" of the rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland were not too understanding at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped into the defense of his team-based investment tactics and said that players simply focused on "contact" when they invested.
Bellamy says she got confidence after two important coaches criticized her team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat her.
"And things don't stop here - we didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us with the 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that I have not changed anything all year round in our defensive systems or techniques, so that in the last six weeks I have really put the focus on contact in payments and thus changed the situation.
Trent is in this function for three years and obviously has a great team so it's probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
We know how it always happens in this period of the year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "sitting the football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the championship in 2010 playing "slicing".
Wayne's talking about football.
And he argued by comparing his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and talking about how palpitating the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care about any black under the nails.
But now there's a team that can play what we consider to be palpative football, especially because of young rapists.
This kind of game you want to do when you have players like that.
He came up with this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his own game style - not any team has two middle houses like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and Roosters was a tougher match compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven't seen him yet, how much was the score?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there have been two trials, that means a palpitating game?
Or do you mean take a break and don't march?
For me, there are plans.
If I'm talking about us, it means we could meet them at a given time.
Storm is free this weekend because they have won the right to play home with North Queensland Cowboys, or with Cronulla Sharks, at the end of Saturday's preliminarys, at AAMI Park, the tickets are being put on sale since March, in the morning.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to get the pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask pictures of abused children.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when she slept then authenticated into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of inappropriate images with children as a subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was sleeping.
He looked on the phone and found disturbing messages after which his mother immediately warned him.
After arriving, the police saw the five photos then analyzed computers found at that address and found "anxious" searches on the Internet using terms to find images that were not appropriate with children.
Hogg claimed that he did it to " attract the pedophiles" on the Internet before "proclaiming that he is a policeman to scare them".
Prosecutor Elid Robertson stated to the Dundee Court: “He has said it is an addiction - it is dependent on fear of man.
He admitted that he did the searches on the computer but said he did it because he wanted to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent the images and about the fact that he asked that person to send them more pictures.
He said he did it to cheer up.
She said she doesn't think clearly when she drinks and she wants to see pictures of rapes and murders.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and cried and cried.
The girl saw the inappropriate images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, at the age of 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the allegations that he had taken or photographed improperly with child subjects, and violated the conditions of release conditioned on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court on 24 March of the current year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered in the register of sexual offenders because it can be said that this offence "did not involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October for reasons of social reporting.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before facing other files.
He's been on the sex offender's record before he was sentenced.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech to Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
It was not injured, however, that the fall filming became viral on socialization networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by opposition representatives who claimed that they would have received anonymous death threats, threatening Mr. Mugabe not to flee during his speech.
Last month he was executed during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The leader of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number, but it is called "death," he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns parliamentarians that immunity applies only to Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The leader of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "anxious" about the threats passed on to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availability
It is anticipated that Hewlett-Packard will make between 25,000 and 30,000 available as part of the restructuring and cost reduction efforts in the service sector.
This year. HP will be divided on the stock exchange into two companies, separating the computer and printer division from corporate hardware and services operations found in rising growth.
The expected availability will bring costs of approximately 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, the HP company said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable structure with regard to costs," Meg Whitman, president and CEO HP, said, who will lead the unit after the break.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP currently and will hold a large business portfolio that will contribute to the business transition to the new business delivery style," Whitman said.
Working as a separate society, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company's statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will "focus on providing seamless integrated solutions" to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by the graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with the object of the activity of the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the "Silicon Valley League".
HP passed through a massive reorganisation to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The HP measure, the second largest computer producer in the world and one of the largest U.S. technology companies, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in a direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the United Kingdom, and remained three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wishing to put the cultural question that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle for the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted on more than 2000 high school students who had symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough many friends "with a healthy condition", his chances of recovery are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of healthy mental friends reduces half the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, in order for the friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response often has priority before meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create a strong personality that is open to entertainment and success, even though isolation is really the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - that also affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn't even buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The killing of Joey and Chandler's frequent arms, the moments when he looks at football in comfortable photos and Ross's passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even though they often dare to explore their feelings completely.
As one social worker explained to me: "My role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who appeal to us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old saying to deal with yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to my mind when I'm trying to offer more psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long term.
The series highlighted little moments of friendship between men.
No matter how much it helps the objective, external intervention, through the telephone, people who have reached the moment of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you're participating this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the complete editing of the filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, and better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and greet.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - on #FriendsFest
Maria's marching and helping PSG give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after marking against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his first match in the Champions League and helped the PSG to challenge the Swedish Malmo team.
We continue to present you with the game's chronicle and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting a series of matches from the Champions League groups, with a peaceful victory 2-0 against Malmo in the game played on Tuesday on the Park des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of her first match in the League of Champions in the PSG team, bringing France champions in advantage although they missed a number of occasions before securing their advantage with the goal marked by Cavani in minute 61.
Going to Group A with Real Madrid and Šahtior Donezk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in the best possible way but also to improve the course to the final quarter in each of the last three tournaments.
However, despite taking the points, Laurent Blanc's students were away from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who wasted the opportunity of empty after being replaced by the team from his hometown and the club that started his bright career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or in the Championships League, so victory with 2-0 creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference with the next classes, even if there are still aspects we have to improve over the season," Blanc says.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I'm sorry we couldn't give one or two more bullets.
Ibrahimovic returned after an accident to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 discount obtained from Bordeaux in the League 1 weekend, but Di Maria took the light of the reflectors in four minutes.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midwife was named the man who will lead the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he leaned at Marco Verrati's passage behind Malmo's defense before sneaking incredibly across Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the right gate.
But if anyone is expected to win the PSG a little bit from his fingers, they have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national teams, with a defense of five people and two defensive mediums, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by making Nikola Djurdjic's shot that passed through Kevin Trapp's post in minute 34.
Instead, the PSG players slowed down several times, giving a few unnecessary steps and not finalizing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed at least five trials only at first and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game was resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved to be much more appreciated in support of his colleagues, his pass being the one that Di Maria sent into a sewer away from Wiland over the door in minutes 52.
The second goal was recorded in a final after an hour of match, due to Cavani, the Uruguayan who recorded the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from the center of Maxwell.
This goal has eliminated the hope of Malmo's rebalance the score and only a superb stop from Wiland's remote rejection of David Luiz kept the final score before the new entry of Ezekiel Lavezzi to cancel an extension.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later said that the PSG was with a class over and that "the last match we played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, I've only played in the league in Sweden, which doesn't stand up at the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Down the hat for the PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore chain $2,5 billion in stock sales
The Swiss miner Glencore, who was hit by the decline in stock prices on the stock exchange, has spent 2.5 billion dollars on the sale of shares as part of a comprehensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, quoted on the London Stock Exchange, said he sold new shares worth 1.6 billion pounds of sterling to buy the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company goes off the line with the prices undercutting from the stock exchange, because China's economic downturn affects demand and causes a market disaster.
The preferential subscription right increased the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning transactions.
The shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 and increased to FTSE 100, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore has revealed the sale of $2.5 billion as part of wider plans to cover almost a third of the debt of $30 billion.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 million per share, with 2.4% less than the closing price of March.
He pulled 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the increase in the Chinese economy in prolonged stagnation has led to a substantial increase in iron mining prices, with approximately half and coal, copper and other goods decreased by 20-40%.
Xi insists on the wider expansion of the economy at the global level
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group charged with reforming that the economy should open up more to the outside world to feed growth.
"China must commit itself to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving opening policies," Xi said during the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for the Continue of General Reforms.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new imbolism and vitality and will lead to economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a number of guides, including a negative list of market access regulation, relaxation of customs control policies, encouraging state companies to absorb private capital and reorganise the resident registration system.
According to the declaration, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity where investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested and improved by testing programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will offer the market a more important role in the allocation of resources, by providing a legislative business environment and by providing a wider opening to the market.
The State authorities will also weaken control over the powers they delegate to companies by ensuring that these companies decide how to manage their business.
According to the declaration, China will also allow border regions to explore new patterns of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
"State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and protect the legitimate interests of foreign investment-based companies and provide them with better services", according to the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green books", optimising the requirements and fluidising the process of filing applications.
The meeting also discussed the guaranteeing of the law of practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.

Education unions, uninterrupted by the Government's proposal to increase wages by 10%
The negotiations between Prime Minister Ponta and the leaders of the Education Unions have not achieved any results, the government is proposing a 10% salary increase from 1 December to 1 January 2016, and the unions have wanted a 15% increase from November, or one 20% from December.
The discussions took place at the Palace of Victoria on Tuesday evening, the prime minister being accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugene Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The Government's proposal today did not thank us, otherwise we would not have been able to call the leaders of our federations.
The 10 percent we promised today represents less for us than we expected.
"In fact, these 10 percent are the money we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government last year for 2016," said Anton Hadar, President Alma Mater, at the end of the discussion.
Ponta: In the future health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have

The situation was similar: the boat transports more people than its capacity, so it shipwrecked.
The road has recently become a popular place for immigrants who want to escape the war and the heavy lives of countries such as Syria or Iraq.

The Stewardess gave the company to the court, won and were remanded, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to determine their weakness have failed," then explains a spokesman for the company.

I understand Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to rule, the whole party.
If we want to formalize through a congressional decision, we'll do this too.

Two Sri Lankan citizens were posted on Monday to Mr. Bors, while they were trying to cross the illegal border, hiding in the semi-trailer of an Italian-run truck.
According to the researchers, it was established that the two paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, the Border Police reported.

On this occasion, border policemen discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer's trailer, among the plastic lashes, two men.
As a result of the checks, the persons concerned, two men, at the age of 28, are citizens of Sri Lanka and asylum seekers in Romania.
"At the researchers, the young people said they intended to reach France, the fact that they had made contact with a conional, through which they met with the Italian driver, who offered to transport him to the destination, where he would receive 2,000 euros per person," she said in a communication to the Border Police.
These two migrants have become "criminal labor in the face of the knowledge of the crime of attempting to smuggle across the state border."

How satisfied the Romans are in the couple: Men versus women
Most Romans are grateful for their relations.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted on the occasion of John Gray's arrival in Romania, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents are declared 'very satisfied' and 'satisfied' by the overall quality of the couple relationship.
"However, 18% appear to be 'unsatisfied use' and 'very unsatisfied' in relation to the couple, and another 18% declare 'appropriate'," is the conclusion of the study, as it appears in a communiqué released, Tuesday, Ziare.com.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analysed separately.
Thus, 28% of males are very satisfied, 39% were satisfied, 17% were satisfied, 6% were very unsatisfactory and 8% were very unsatisfied.
As far as women are concerned, 33% were declared satisfied, 24% were very satisfied, 8% were very unsatisfactory, 14% were easily unsatisfied, and 19% had chosen a suitable category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
As for the neutral state (as appropriate), we see a difference of two percent.
"In the same way, in a very unsatisfactory situation, the biggest difference is recorded in the easily unsatisfied response where we see a 6% difference," the communication added.
The study showed that a quarter of Romans (26%) spend an hour or even less together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% spend between two and four hours.
The researchers suggest that "Romans need something more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), security (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, trust 17%, place 17%, connect 17%, know-how 16%, protection 14%, important 14%, learning 12%, freedom 11%, self-awareness 10% and control 7%".

It was only a half an hour.

What's going on with Coach Darren Cahill
Simona Halep is in front of a crucial decision for her career, and she needs to choose whether to continue or not to work with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year under the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being only accompanying the novel to the major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise at Cahill's address, which seems to be the only coach who managed to impose himself on the sporty.
The Adidas programme will end at the end of this year, and Halip must decide whether to offer a consistent contract to Cahill or to give up his collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We talk and see.

Victor Piturca devalued how Romania's national team split in the fall of last year.
The former electorate testified that he did not understand the FRF president Razvan Burleanu, after taking Mircea Sandu's place, and thus decided to leave the country.
Finally, he proposed to the head of the Federation that substantially raise his salary to remain, but he was refused.
I'm not sorry for leaving the country right now.
Then I felt bad, leaving a job behind.
So I thought then it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a picker, wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I wasn't respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found different opinions from the press about me.
He didn't change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
I continued my work, everything turned out very well and probably changed his ideas too.
But I wanted to go.
If she wanted to stay, then I proposed getting a contract.
We have around 400 and a few thousand euros a year, then we have around 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but his right hand.
"It was agreed, but only if we finish first in the group," Victor Piturca said at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania's national in the fall of last year, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminary.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.

Rare disease suffered by a man
American Nick Hess was spent by his family as an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was upset, could hardly stand his feet and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he didn't consume alcohol, he was obviously drunk.
When he accused me of being drunk, without being drunk, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe like drinking alone, it's an alcoholic in secret'," she said, according to Miror.
When he saw his wife's films with him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, simply didn't admit: "I looked in my eyes and wasn't there."
'It was horrible, I didn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, although suspected of a while of him, eventually went with him to numerous doctors, remembered that Nick's breathing smelled of alcohol.
The moment that put Nick's guts the most was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, he found out he had a three-time alcoholism over his legal lymnite, although with one night before he only consumed one beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick was suffering from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Practically, the body or makes all the carbohydrates consumed to fermented, turning into alcohol.
The one who paid for this could be Nick's disease was actually his wife.
The disease hasn't got a cure yet, but since he gave up on carbohydrates, Nick had no more episodes like that.
Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf cross
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest against the services he had taken from his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf cross, causing enough damage to get the car out of use, transmits BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the moment came on the Internet, for the fun of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car had defects that put his life and his family at risk.
His guess was when the dealer from whom he bought the car didn't solve his problem, as agreed.
The government approved, on Wednesday, "The National Strategy on Immigration for the period 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the Year in progress", documents considered to be "a further step that Romania is going through in modernising the immigration management process in the national territory", according to a press release.
The source shows that the strategy aims to manage effectively the immigration phenomenon, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect policies set at European level, adapted to national realities.
Given the problems faced by the states of Romania's immediate neighbourhood, measures were taken to ensure the unity and coherence of the situations identified by the possible emergence of an outflow of illegal immigrants in Romania, generated by situations of political, social, economic or military crisis.
"Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but, at the same time, will pay particular attention to citizens from countries with potential migrationist status or who can bring about national security," the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivation of the Iraq conflict, maintaining an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document sets out and sets out a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, the stricter control of the legality of the headquarters of third-country nationals in Romania and the proper application of the removal and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to third-country nationals in Romania who are in need of employment, promoting access to third-country nationals by higher education institutions in Romania for the areas and professions identified as deficits.
Referring to the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it is "a means of establishing concrete activities leading to the creation of a flexible system for stopping the migrationist phenomenon in growth".
Romania, in a European labour market summit

Indications refer to expenditure on staff of employers.

Romania, in place of three in the EU at the increase in labour costs

The individual EU countries in which the hourly labour cost decreased in the two-month period this year were Greece (2.9%), Cyprus (1.2%) and Italy (0.4%).
The increase in labour costs in Romania in April - June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly labour cost of industry and services, with 7.9% and 7.6% respectively.

Report on the activities of the TVR leadership, rejected by the Commission: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
Parliament's cultural commissions rejected on Wednesday the report of the Governing Council of the Romanian Television Society in 2014.
17 MPs voted against the report, one opposed the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abdicated.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Permanent Bureaus.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary meeting will be debated.
"I think that in view of this situation it will be done relatively quickly," Senator Georgica Severin, president of the Commission on Culture, said.
He added that "the era of good sense" as well as the TVR leadership should be present at this meeting, provided that there was no representative of the TVR leadership at the meeting of the Cultural Commissions.
It was good to be present for the TVR leadership because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation was made to CA members last night, with about an hour we didn't even know the time, but today, after the Bureau meeting, I personally sent a fax to TVR's management inviting her.
I think at the time you're summoned, you're being budgeted, paid from public fees and you're being called to a board meeting even if you don't like live.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after the Committees meeting on Parliament's culture.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed during the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees of Budgets.
The duties we saw as they continued, came up with the idea that this year would have been a day, but they weren't paid out of history.
"I remind you that it is not my fault or anyone else in these committees that has lost that agreement with banks and the fiscal, there are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the whole meeting they will follow the elections for a new Board of Directors and he will elect the head of the institution.
I don't know who's going to be proposed for this function.
They're not gonna do it.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there will be a genius who will stand by the tail here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the whole of Parliament, by their vote will choose with great enthusiasm the people who will lead the TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of correctness and respect for the girl of institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what quality it should be - I feel good about the wage girl because she's a fucking kid who comes from the employees, the claimants, the fired.
"When you get 50, 60, 70, something like this is powerful and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster," the president of the Senate's Committee on Culture concluded.
Although not presented to Parliament, TVR President-Director-General Stelian Tanase sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies Valeriu Zgonea, requesting that Parliament take into account a number of measures that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the numbering and indexing of the TV fee.
In writing, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the TV tax index, the modification and supplementing of HG 978/2003 on the tax for public television service, in order to update the provisions at the level of technological changes per day, as well as to regulate the procedure for the control of the TV tax and the detection of infringements and the application of sanctions and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision to prevent the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv agents for the collection of TV tax by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission of home affairs.
Stelian Tanase calls for a reduction in the VAT quota for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution to the CNC from 15% to 3%, but also for the amendment of Law 41/1994, in order to be able to receive the budget/funding allocation for the purchase of major cultural and sports events licences - World Football Championship, Golden Cerbula, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will be unable to pay over the following months, considering that labour law obliges the employer to implement judicial decisions, even if they are not final, and that wages rights are given priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce staff costs and the production of TV.
"This reduced displacements and other cost-generating activities, a number of trade contracts were renegotiated, and the TVR News post was closed at the end of July," the President of TVR said.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by her own efforts.
"Without the support of the state institutions - the Government, Parliament, the Presidency - the Roman Television will find itself, sooner or later, in the impossibility of fulfilling its public mission," he said in writing.
The Head of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.

The investigation re-examined the fact that, for the purpose of deducting taxes and taxes from the state budget, representatives of a company specialised in security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, by which fictitious transactions would have been recorded.
"In fact, the company's accounting would have registered fictitious service purchases, which, in fact, had not been provided, the state budget was thus damaged by around 600,000 euros," the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
The Seikis have established the fate of Sanmartean
The 6th Al-Ittihad Club has established the fate of the middle Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announced that Sanmartean's division of Ittihad is imminent, former printer Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanou, says this will no longer happen.
Boloni is very grateful for Sanmartean.
Lucian plays match titler and does it well.
The sharks also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been the option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been several discussions, such as that with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has been done," Zaporojanou told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad at the beginning of this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted Vice-President at the Court of Auditors
Parliament's plenary voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, Prime Minister Victor Ponta's cousin, as Vice-President of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were recorded "for" and 108 votes "for".
The vote was secret, with bulletins.
PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 reported.
Otherwise, the liberals criticised Sarbu's name in this function and announced that they would challenge the CCR, under conditions where he had a DNA file, but did not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics anymore.
The PSD Senator will serve as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, remaining free after John Anton was revoked, as a result of a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he had been appointed unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper was going to play the role of a chef in the Burnt movie, the actor made a devaluation that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up in the kitchen: "I've worked a lot of my life as a cook."
It devalued that it had been working in the kitchen for 15 years, when it worked for a Greek restaurant, because then, in college, it continued the same way.
The actor explained that his mother had Italian origins, so the whole childhood cooked with Italian grandmother, related ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had at that time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man to make plans for five years, "not even two."
"It's no reason for me to have a map," he said.
"I had dreams, things you'd love to tell you," she said, saying, but what she wanted from her childhood was fulfilled.
At the age of 40, however, the actor acknowledged that he was in the near future directing, following the model of Clinton Eastwood, who had taken the king to this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned the harsh statements of Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Wednesday morning in accordance with Hungary's political decisions are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his Iranian statements, he was jeopardising the whole of Hungary," Hungarian Foreign Minister conveyed in a communiqué.
Civilized European politicians do not say such things about uncontrolled fraud.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has lost his full support in Romania's internal policy," the Hungarian diplomat's chief added, according to MTI.
In a Tuesday evening post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he would like to draw attention and sanction the behavior of senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a shame to the European Union's culture and values".
I do not want to respond to the challenges posed by the Hungarian government representatives.
"Accession is a shame for the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all types, and now during the refugee crisis," Ponta said on Facebook.
The Roman Prime Minister added that it is the need for rational and sustainable solutions in the refugee crisis, considering that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Gimpata scars, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only appear to be political decisions in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which these refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and above all in European values - what we see in Hungary in the last days is in total contradiction with these goals and values," the head of the Roman executive stressed.
Earlier Tuesday, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the remarks of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta regarding the management of Hungary's refugee crisis, considering that those statements were inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to MTI.
The chief of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday as the "extremist and false hints" of the first Romanian political crisis tin in Romania and stated that Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Roman side.
Szijarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've said and said is that I'm always against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the granites, that all those who come are terrorists, are the fools of the Middle Ages and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we're going to get it, the problem is our logistics ability to treat these people like some people, not how they treat our Hungarian neighbors, with battle and insertation.
"That's not what I agree with," said the chief of the Roman executive, at a press conference at Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Budapest has decided to start preparations for the extension of the border with Romania of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia to face any changes to the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to raise a border guard does not solve any of the refugee problems and "save Hungary from Europe".
What's the connection between Osama bin Laden and Macca's macara?
The Saudi authorities announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the Osama bin Laden family, is "partially responsible" for the plunging of a macaral, on Friday, at the Mecca Sea, an accident caused by 107 people died.
According to a commission of inquiry, the company did not "compliance with security standards", the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported, the BBC report.
The company's directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is now led by the former terrorist leader's brother, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for four years on the extension of Mari Mosche to host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday evening, during a storm, when a macara, probably unbalanced by the strong windmills, collapsed on the eastern side of the Marie Moschei roof in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi's mouth closed the contestants
Considered by many of the world's greatest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled after withdrawing from the activity, as a weak coach, which cannot be able to perform in the new position.
After the unfortunate experiences on the national team, Stara or Galatasaray, Hagi took over a year later the role of coach to the future of Constanta, the team he sponsors.
After I fixed a year after the team was taken over, the King demonstrated that he was capable of transforming a team that was fighting for rescue from retrograde into a top.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 winners, 11 remises and 11 infractions.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, which fights at European dome.
Things took a better and better tournament for the Future in this season, the team intruded to place two in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 holes (equal to Astra), more than double than Stara.
On the other hand, even if it brought more experienced players to the team, The Hague continued its policy of promoting young people, and in the last period of the team started names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy in the future has made a follow-up team for foreign teams, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Next to the Star, The Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to the data from the Register of Commerce.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played as a small country so far.
It is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the EU's seventh country.
The big countries come with solutions for the EU as a whole, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the College of Directors of the Centre for European Policy.
In an interview given to Ziare.com, Christian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a force, and even the police will not function in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come with."
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as best we can and adapt them to us.
In the opinion of Christian Ghinea, we are at an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel they need to show their muscles.
Once he passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up their free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area need to be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and has not been adapted to the situation at the moment".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that actually solved nothing?
It is clear that the EC presidents, in agreement with Donald Tusk, did not want to strengthen a vote in the Council.
All the predictions said he would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Lisbon Treaty, the JAI applies the principle of unanimity and any state can block any decision.
That is why things were very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
Following Lisbon, the normal procedure in which the EC has the initiative is applied and the Council approves a 55% vote among the states, i.e. 16, which represents 65% of the EU's population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it is a sensitive issue, rejection reactions have appeared even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's opening policy and did not want in many countries to appear to be a reaction like "the EU sends migrants on our heads".
They have soaked, but the problem remains because, obviously, this valley creates a huge problem for the Schengen governor and we will probably attend major changes there over the next period.
So the mandatory quotas were not really eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to cool down?
Yes, on the other hand, it is talking about a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of the members at the Schengen external border to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece's Granite with Turkey is also Germany's Granite with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps he will give up on the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are responsible for the state in which the first time comes, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece takes over, you can't say infinity that it's Greece's job.
Problem and common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve without a specific mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, to make the reception effort?
No one knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work if they reach them.
Because there's a problem: what are you doing with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states are going to pick up migrants: you're going to X or Y.
It is likely to reach some single filtration centres, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications are processed.
They're working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have ten years of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, such as Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the current xenophob.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are sitting in prayer camps and who have just begun to go to Europe.
A estimate says that only 10% have managed to leave, winter is hard past the Mediterranean, but we're waiting for the next year for a wave perhaps even bigger.
What are we doing with these people?
My prediction is that we will get used to this problem, not look at it as a media disaster.
Talk about countries with less or greater experience.
Do you think there is a place where it has truly succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they are still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to the radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other migration waves, but this does not mean that they are not integrated at all.
There was an incomplete part left that creates major social problems in France, Germany, the United Kingdom.
But by the way, the police won't work.
To create the strength of Europe and illusion.
It must be based on integration mechanisms in European societies.
There's been some mistakes here.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let's ask these people to learn the language, try to take the values, stop standing in Europe and with one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family even through the marriage agreement.
But the problem of these people's future long-term integration problems must be separated.
If others have failed to integrate in the long term, it does not mean that we should look at them as they go in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, what I don't think, doesn't mean that the country will recover overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions are established, we see strengths in Europe.
Granite is closed, walls are raised, checks are reintroduced at the border in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project like that no, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and setting the rules so that the pressure was too high on the ground where I first put my foot on these migrants.
I mean, we're running around free, but everyone's in trouble.
In the face of such a wave it can't be, because some countries don't make the girl.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they do something, but in the long term there is no big change.
After the attacks in France, we have no anti-terrorist legislation much more dramatic in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that is installed in both ways.
And it's so unstable from one week to the next that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of rumors, a lot of belligerent statements from politicians who are at home under the pressure to be men.
And then, you have a dramatic case of a child in a leak in Turkey and the public opinion is excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for the good.
This is the single European real market.
And I don't think Europeans will give up on this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the situation from now on.
How did Romania play in this crisis so far?
Like a little country that thinks if she pulls the trigger on her eyes and tears her ears off, the theme disappears.
In the face of the reality of migratory waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country's problem.
We have done this, it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the EU's seventh country.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
The great countries come with solutions for the entire EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Roman appetite for Schengen will decline very much.
President Johnnis says it may be good that we haven't already entered.
So we move from the despair of entering to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
Of course there is a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen to see us as an alternative route.
Which doesn't mean that it's a reason not to enter Schengen anymore, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, will be the only rules for accepting migrants, the only rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, the only rules for the countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a link between the second focus, a Russian game?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being powerful means injuring Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a link.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have failed a long time ago.
And it was good to go through before the main or the opponent was the Islamic State.
Some two years has been a struggle between the Assad regime and the secular and moderate Muslim armies, supported by the Gulf and the West.
Then the Islamic state has risen and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
It creates a focus of instability and chaos that cannot close.
But you're very powerful only if you have the solutions.
The game off-side is just a strategy to win time.
Maybe Putin expects to make offers, push him on the buttons to solve the situation.
Offerings don't come because the world is not convinced that he can solve in some way or other issues created by him.
But I don't agree with the theories that these people are being held by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will soon appear
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the Like button, and now the socialization network representatives are preparing another opposite, the Dislike button.
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be available soon, reports New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg stated that the "Dislike" button will look better than a nude than a user feels more than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wanted to avoid the times when someone posted on the account or an important event in his life, and someone else will give "Dislike."
Network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked to be able to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg said it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable giving Like those posters," said the Facebook representative.
The variant of a new Facebook button was not well received by everyone.
"There is already enough hatred on Facebook and on socialization networks," Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan commented on the New York Times Facebook page, where an article was posted on this subject.
"I'll give the "Disk" button to the "Disk" button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, said there's nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social analyst at the eMarketer company, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she supports it, the election campaign is approaching in America, and the Dislike button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands of arrivals at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi announced.
Hungary has declared an emergency during the day in two juries along the border with Serbia due to the refugee flow, invoking a main point of crossing the border and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
The measure has delayed a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Even yesterday they said they'd seal the granite for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to eat asylum.
"As you can see, this is completely different," said Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin.
Before imposing the new immigration legislation, a 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also settled in Hungary in Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" seat of the Jewish Council stands to drink.
Two builders, insolvent
The massive investments that have been made here in recent years for the purpose of moving the institution remain to be attributed to the fact that they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here entered insolvency during the work.
The Jewish Council headquarters in the street Vasile Alessandri will be able to give himself up.
Within one and a half years of the completion of the consolidation and refurbishment of the building, the works did not reach half.
One last step in the building's era was spent last day when the National Dispute Resolution Council (NCSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take the contract to implement the technical project for the most work to be done.
The initial project was completed by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the builder and the termination of the works, the negotiation procedures were initiated without publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, which was to update the technical project and then a new contract for works was organised.
"The negotiations did not end with a contract, however, considering that the proposed form would be disadvantageous to the institution," said Rázvan Timofciuc, representing public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to interrupt the direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Court of First Instance referred the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it, as late as possible.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC decision at the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of that decision, taking into account the finding of another designer.
Thus, the building's consolidation work could be resumed early next year.
Our intention is to resume the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not last long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We expect to see if the NCIC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
The consolidation of the former Police Headquarters began in 2011.
A first contract of work was concluded in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei were carried out.
The tender was withdrawn, the contract being awarded by Moldovaconstruct SA.
However, the company entered into insolvency, and this contract was settled after making payments of 1.5 million lei.
The work has been done so far in proportion to approximately 50%.
Initially, the consolidation, redundancy and mansaring of the building was assessed at 7.7 million lei.
"It's over, I say it all!" - a statement that could incriminate former head of the Department
One of the employees involved in the scandal file from the Cadastral Office has signed an agreement to recognise the facts, against imprisonment with delay.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the others accused, in front of the former chief, Narciza Nedelcu
A councillor from the Office of the Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) was accused of DNA in a corruption file and recognized his telefon.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascalu was registered yesterday at the Iași Tribunal, the judges establishing a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dmitru Daniel Dascalu was accused of being an intellectual liar in a continuous form and agreed to execute two years in prison with delay, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
With regard to Dascalu's facts, the prosecutors stated that he, as a councillor of the Cadastral Office, together with other colleagues, "consulted several verbal acceptance processes, acquired previously key service contracts by O.C.P.I. Also with the directors of SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Castro Agency and Topography SRL and PFA Lipša Stefan, who in fact testified that the services contracted were carried out entirely, under conditions where they were not carried out and were not deposited at O.C.P.I.I.Iași".
Last day, former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of the OCPI were sent to the court in this case, the charges being the decommissioning of services to the companies mentioned, although the works were not carried out.
The trial is over 300,000 lei.
Adventures in Stone Age
In the opinion of the president of FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the National Women's Handball to qualify for the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday during a press meeting that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the League of Champions.
With regard to Romania's national women's handball team, "the main goal is to qualify for the Rio Olympic Games, but for this it has to go through two stages of hot furs, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will consist of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, doctor, two masori, porter coach, physical preparer, head of delegation.
They've asked us to qualify for some things, more exactly material for physical preparation, that we've never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympics. And I'll do whatever it takes to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because at the moment we're in the rock age with the preparation.
"The teams with which we are fighting have these materials and have them for a while," said Dedu, who mentioned that he was trying to get the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The president of the FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and to the possibility that our country will host a major handball competition.
We don't have a room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is shameful to be asked about a European Gymnasium Championship.
Let's not forget that other corners of the world have built entire Olympic districts over a period of two years.
Before 1992, in the present Barcelona Olympic area, there was a bunch of garbage, and now there is a beauty trail.
It also happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics were a success and from the point of view of investments.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball organisations are willing to grant Romania a major competition.
For me, it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gaţu went civilized with a project, people gave him their agreement in principle, but they soon realized that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said that I agree and invite them to the first match in the new room in Bucharest and then we discuss concrete.
"So we have all the opening, both at the EHF and IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," official FRH explained.
The former great handballist has avoided assessing the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be reserved in forecasts, that if they do not meet they will return against them".
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbyists Begins on September 23rd, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday at a press conference that all members of the Romanian lot are ready for World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to win two victories: "We are ready".
Both me and my colleagues are with the motors at maximum speed.
We've trained to give the best performance in the four matches.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first time with France and then we'll see.
But if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will certainly be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it's the announcement of so many years of work.
I wish I didn't disappoint anyone in the ruby family and come home with nice results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like the rugby in Romania, are proud of the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romania's national team selector Lynn Howells, who is the first coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby selection: "It's a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
It is very important for me to make Romanians proud of the national team in each match.
The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitras, believes that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in the past years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish sportsmen success and I am convinced that we will be at the forefront of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romanian teams at the age of 18-19, so there is cohesion, it's a band of friends, who set them up to make a dream," said Dumitrash.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve into Group D, with the following matches scheduled: with France on 23 September in London; with Ireland on 27 September in London; with Canada on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday, at the Twickenham stadium in London, with the England - Fiji match in Group A.

14 million lei given to the hospital "St. Spiriton" from Iaşi at budget correction
What will be bought with this important amount of money?
The Hospital "St. Spiriton" received about 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health following the budgetary adjustment.
The money received by the medical unit to use by the end of the year will be invested in the modernisation and repair of clinics, but also in medical equipment and technology for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six trusses used for surgical interventions, six ATI beds equipped with appropriate ophthalmographic microscope and other devices necessary for the performance of the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei from the money received from the hospital will be directed to the construction and repair of the "Great Ars".
Out of the budget correction money, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernisation work in the main throne.
"In addition, the next few days we will receive work from the gateway linking UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure transport under decent conditions of the UPU patient in neighbouring clinics," the manager of the medical unit explained.
The hospital will soon have in court and the Dermatology Clinic in Tatarasi, which will organize it in the ambulance, in the same form that it is currently operating.
The clinic will function in the area where it is allergy, haematology and endocrinology from the outpatient and will have approximately 30 beds.

The bird of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iaşi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience, neither my wife nor I ever want to walk in your city again.
Without wishing, they were hit by the wrong information from the pilots, the unsatisfaction of the RAPT controllers, and, bonus, an amendment "that's what the law says".
The husbands arrived in Iaşi a few days ago, settled in a hotel in the Centre and asked for travel trips.
They also got an envelope in which the RATP routes were past.
"Fall" with these maps, the husbands have visited the Isaac.
But two days ago, they found themselves in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Since it was not toned with tickets at the station near the Copou Park, they were based on the information printed on the flyer: that they can take the ticket through SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
They went on a bus and tried to send a text message after the instructions on the pilot.
Unfortunately for them, he made his appearance a team of RATP controllers.
They said there was no service for 2 years and that they announced it was cancelled.
How does the EU know what was written in the local press, I'm coming one night before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it's not their job.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said all I can do is call us one amendment instead of two (May and wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to spend my visiting day standing at January and giving the statements there," relates Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of incorrect information on the envelope and the controllers who "implemented the law on blood".
It's not right, and I made an appointment at the RAP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not too much, but the idea is that I felt wrong.
Ghinion for Vaslui rapists.
They had an accident and remained in preventive arrest
The process of the seven rapists from Vaslui moved, yesterday, to the Court of Appeal.
The judges tried the first term of trial at a non-public meeting where the seven young people accused of having beaten an 18-year-old asked to be released.
Before the trial started, one of the judges who had been assigned the file, Viorel Monteanu, made an application for detention, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The judge activated until this summer at the Vaslui Court, where he was the president of the Nale Section, which, on 9 April, admitted a complaint made by four of the defendants, having them arrested at home.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete part of the Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu Magistrates.
Earlier, in the case, Judge Dan An ton also made an abstention, because his daughter is in a co-coupling relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that Vaslui's rapists would continue to remain in pre-trial detention.
You blacks will remain incarcerated for at least 30 more days, when the Jews will spare the possibility of their release.
Following the term of trial will take place at the Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before arriving at the Court of Appeal Iași, the suspect with whom the Violators were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident produced in the Păcurari district, the car entering Iaşi at the center.
The Iveco self-use with which the seven rapists were transported hit a Volks wagon bus that came out of Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The dubium runs from the end of the Pacurari.
The car entered Iaşi here because the employees of the Penitentiaries Administration preferred the route from Vaslu to Iaşi at Graduri, then on the bus stop.
They've been so short on the road for a few kilometers.
Immediately after the impact, the arrest escort called for another transport to take over custody.
In a short time, at the scene of the accident, a car was sent from the Maximum Security Prisoner Iași, who took over the seven detainees and transferred them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrests were injured.
To transfer it to the second dub, the guards surrounded the back of the nets, and the arresters came out fast, two or two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, as drivers of vehicles have been friendly about the damage to be paid," said Commissioner Médălin Çaranu, from the IPJ.
Large migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the outset, clearly and clearly: those of the 7,000 refugees who should and should naturalise Romania is, in itself, a small but huge number compared to the ability of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, is far more than the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Of course, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extremely small.
I'm convinced they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasite of interlocutors and paralysed by a venous political class, the Romanian state proves powerless in all areas.
The inability to integrate cigarettes is just a banal example.
In addition, governments of any color have been unable to absorb European funds, make roads, gardens or modern schools, provide decent medical care, raise street poverty, create decent paid jobs or keep their young generation at home.
Why would refugees be established in another country where they are fleeing?
But what makes a lot of wonder is the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first hit by the war effort of the EU's powerful states, which give the utmost evidence of generosity when it comes to sharing the problems with the smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of the Romanians who, although they have millions of rubble scattered around the world, still do not accept the other - another language, another religion, another blood.
He's probably afraid of stealing any of his national beings.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invoke war horrors as a reason for their departure, do not accept the Exodus destination other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
But not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simple way in which the crisis is analysed can only be taken away.
Causes must be eliminated, some of them must be supported and, strictly based on the book of political justice, demand peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an anchored, decoupled and outperforming building.
I was complaining that Romania is not capable of inventing a country project, but that neither does the EU have a future plan.
And improvisations and threats don't help anything.
What is the EU then, if the only advantage the Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be discussed because of the waves of refugees crossing the border as cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the crisis of migrants, though.
Over the next decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource exhaustion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa to a better life.
As politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will follow.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination, in practice, imposed
The tendering procedure shall cover a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of imprisonment, the Club of the Museum of Roman Literature is offered by the Jewish Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
The construction has a useful area of 134 mp, on two levels of mine.
CJ accepts as destinations given to the building only those of the literary cafe, library or other activities with cultural profile.
The building was assessed at EUR 68,300, the start value of the tender being EUR 6,830 per year, with a bid of EUR 25.
The concessionaire will have to continuously and continuously exploit the building and cover the entire costs of rehabilitation of the property, in accordance with the technical project to be completed.
"The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period during which these spaces operated the public food unit and after its evacuation, no current repair and maintenance work has been carried out as often as necessary during the operation of a building", the documentation on the tendering procedure is mentioned.
The club's concession offers are expected until 18 September.
Two brothers from Tomeşti swallowed dreams.
They were taken to the hospital
Two 9-year-olds, respectively 11-year-olds from Tomesti, brothers, swallowed more Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother followed a treatment, and the medications were not hidden.
The children were taken urgently to St. Mary's Hospital in Iaşi.
They're stable, as doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20, he received a courageous gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in the dark of the 1990s, when he had only two months of life, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a family established in Italy, in the same years when adoption was regulated, an outgoing young woman, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met the others in Iaşi with biological parents from a village of the judge, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will fulfill these days for 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to offer their beloved daughter a wonderful and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, Iaşi, to get to know her unclear past.
"The Day of Iaşi", who attended the efforts to search the family of origin after a few extremely vague indications, was a witness to these meetings that almost broke your heart.
Reporting reporters, momentary emotions, statements of those involved, their reactions are of the moving and coercive right.
The story of China starts 20 years ago in the Ruginosa exit village, when it was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
Home there were misunderstandings between parents, and Mother was forced to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I've known nothing.
"When I found out that she was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and still her father, Costa Balkans, went to work in the city of Alexandria, the state of Teleorman.
Their lives were to be definitely divided.
They never found Crina at the hospital again.
After boarding, Crine's father left for work in another location, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iaşi, and the father, when he came back, never found her again.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"I'd think she was abandoned," she tells a family nephew.
Because of financial problems, Grandma was unable to come with Crina to Iaşi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was interested in the child's fate all this time, she was taken over by the Directorate-General for Social Assistance and Child Protection Iași, who then gave it to the care of the Plasment Centre in Bucium.
It was years when abandonment and adoption were further regulated against today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by the Italian Salvadoran and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted their child but did not succeed.
They fell in love instead of the Crina blonde, and after some time it was supposed to move definitively with them in Italy.
The small has already been nearly two years since the adoption formalities took place.
When I saw Crina, I felt she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given her life," says Salvadore, the adoptive father, smiling at us as he grabs the girl's palm.
In the country, the parents of China, Alina and Costa, continued their search separately, wherever they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginosa, but he didn't get any answers where his child might be.
The police then told them that it was possible to die, but Iasi's parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I was looking for her here, they told me to go to the court in Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions for looking for her were gone.
We prayed to God to be good.
I've thought about it all the years that have passed, but there's no way we could walk, find it.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in China's biological mother's eyes.
However, even though the years have passed, Ruginosa’s parents have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and her wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past was a link to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents from Romania," Crina confesses joyfully.
And her dream was going to come true.
In March of this year, Commissioner Ichim, Director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Advisory Anti-Drug Iași, was contacted by a knowledge from Italy that explained Salvador's desire to find the family of China.
And the search only started with a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
We only got a name, the Costa Rican Balkans, then the locality, Ruginosa.
In a short time I had an activity with the primacy there, and I could ask if there was a locality named.
Then they gave me a few clues, just that the person found wasn't the one you were looking for.
"It lasted up to about a month till we found the biological father of the girl," Roman Chief Ichim explains.
In total, over three months they took the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially that everyone had their own home elsewhere.
We started going somewhere in March, and in June-July we ended the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that a first meeting would take place in September," Romica Ichim added.
In the weekend that passed, Alina and Costica saw for the first time the girl who was lost at the hospital in Iaşi, 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could hardly master his tears, and his hands kept shaking.
He's barely changing a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, she couldn't sleep too much.
He was still excited, trembling.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," says a nephew, who came with Costica from Ruginosa.
Meeting of China with its mother and biological brother
In his discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-quoted university in Italy, Costa Rica Balkan told him, among other things, that if he ever wanted to return to him, in the village, he could come quietly: he could give him something, a goat, to find a boy from the village and build a house.
Mom is also excited, crying, and she hardly believes that something like that can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I've seen such cases on TV, I've been thinking these years, I've been hoping, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a link," she tells us with great tears on the lips of Alina, the mother of Crine, while holding a servant in her hand.
He's still hiding his tears, he's happy, because in a short time he'll see her with her daughter after so much bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will be fulfilling in just a few days, this month, 20 years old, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she's got a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to collect his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to say.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are the ones who raised me.
It'll be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina tells us.
First family meeting in Iaşi
In the Union market, under the early autumn sky, the family in Ruginosa reunites their destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old now, graduates from high school, according to the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costa, her biological parents.
I don't divide borders or countries anymore, but just a barrier: the language.
Which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Iaş, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first such event, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will.
It's the first event of this sort of organized, of such emotional load, and I'm glad to be a success.
We, at the Centre, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with consumers, drug-dependent people.
But we're trying to get the companies back something good.
"If I have been asked for such an event, I will do it very well," says Rominque Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Advisory Iași.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, is moving away from the story.
I understand: they have a lot to tell each other.
Armistice with guns at the foot, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everybody's pulling his soul
The PSD's outgoing subsidiary has completed a arms armistice on its feet.
After successive rounds of discussions, carried out by Friday to Sunday, the first being and the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
The executive president of the party, Liviu Dragnea, asked to present a united position, the outgoing social-democrats will send him an entire list of potential candidates to the functions of the party.
Apart from being finished, the internal war in the party seems to have taken only a break to allow fighters to take their souls.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He has launched a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: try to find a solution to avoid endangering the party.
On October 3rd, we have a party election.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of weekend discussions only led to the conclusion that there was nothing certain about it.
In the elections in October, there is an acute competition for the office of President of the Jewish subsidiary of the PSD.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main function of the outgoing branch of the party is the Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, Jewish adviser Vasile Catea and the interim president of the Jewish Council, Victorel Lupu.
They could also be added by the mayor of the municipality of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into account is also the candidacy of PSD Jewish councillor Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu will no longer be registered in the race, coming from the party claiming that it is not interested in function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in the last days is the former branch leader, Prime Minister Gheorghe Nilita.
The list of candidates is open.
In accordance with the statute, including in the election day, candidates may be filed, and would not look at anyone if it happened.
"It is important that we remain united, and we will remain after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent Jewish Bureau and all new leadership structures," Catea said.
Until internal elections are organised, the management of the Jewish PSD branch will be ensured by Victorel Lupu, a close associate of Niita and Stanciu.
Lupu is, however, on vacation until 29 September, preparing the elections to be practically assured by the executive secretary of the branch, Jewish adviser Mihail Popescu, in a cold relationship with the Nilita camp.
Phone contact, Christian Stanciu has appreciated the discussions over the last few days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
It reached a partial consensus, in order to support a uniting team to deal with the judge.
"On the other hand, there are several options on the intention to apply for the PSD presidency Iași, the list remaining open," Stanciu commented.
An outgoing judge rejected Vaslui's rapist file on the grounds of concubination
The seven young men in Vaslui's trial who are convicted of rape come to the Court of Appeal today.
The prisoners sentenced to five years and eight months and eight months and four months will present their arguments today on their release, after the substantive court, the Vaslui Court of Justice, has established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making an application for detention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton appealed that one of the accused's lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How the Judges Motivated the Sentence
At the end of last week, the judge at Vaslui's Court of Justice who sentenced the seven young people to jail justified the sentence.
On the ground, the judge talks about the challenging reaction of the accused, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation in the public opinion.
"The Court finds that after the imposition of a preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not a private measure of freedom, under the impact of the attitudes of the accused, their families and their local supporters, a strong sense of indignation at the local and national level has been felt at the level of the local community as to the fact that persons accused of serious crimes are judged under a less restrictive measure," it appears in the reasoning of the Vaslui Judge.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven accused who in the course of the trial appealed that the girl they raped would not be "the door of the church".
"The Court underlines that the moral quality of the injured person is not relevant, the aspect that the accused wanted to highlight by the defences they formulated, since a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," it further states.
Corbyn, Brexit and Europe's future
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past ten years cannot continue the same in the coming years.
By Saturday, probably a few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he has become the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many wonder how we can be affected by the choice of a politician who is therefore not in a position of decision.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing leader of post-war labians.
Marxist declared, the anti-Monarist (at a time given to Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to take the royal family out of Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a supporter of Vladimir Putin (was otherwise regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today"), and the terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at that time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferred by the United States.
According to the model of all populist demagogos, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things about the kind of people he was telling and promised Tsipras in Greece until he got married to the real world and economic laws.
The economic programme of the new Labour Leader provides, inter alia, for massive renationalisations and for the printing of money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution to the printing of money is not unanimously adopted globally, then we have a global prosperity! but who else can prevent such details.
Of course, we can charge bankers for blood, become some kind of left-handed enemy, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the Mitterand and Holland mandates.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous promises, without covering up, made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher rightly pointed out, "the problem of socialism is that at some point the other money is over."
A little I give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever get to prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical left leader, Michael Foot, who was still not as extreme in conviction as the party's new leader, failed sadly in the elections.
And then there is still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential than they were now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the workforce as a whole, and extensive automations have made it necessary in industry to have a highly skilled workforce, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
However, even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its last number of Financial Times, Corbyn's election increases Brexit's chances of leaving the EU, respectively.
The new Labour Leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is an agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has led to the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this kind of idea with those expressed by the radical right, with rhetorical anti-migration, and look at the crisis of refugees who are struggling on EU grounds, you get an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
However, if the British decide after the referendum, which is due to take place by 2017, to leave the Union the symbolic loss of capital for the entire European project and the deep gaps created within this Euro crisis and now the refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
As much as for a whole series of Member States, London was a contradiction to the French-German axis (in which however Berlin becomes increasingly the dominant actor).
True, the British business environment, the City, is a strong lawyer for the country's stay in the EU.
But Europe today is no longer the one in the past.
There are many reactions, which grow in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we have just recently had a sample in Jean Claude Junker's speech, tends to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens under conditions where electoral support for anti-system formations, anti-immigration that are at the same time Eurosceptic is growing spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative loads has reached higher rates than ever before.
From where and the conclusion drawn by the Financial Times when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that goes from national interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in the current policy.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we will attend a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and at the edge of interest and at that time the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States is feeding her popular rhetoric of the accumulation of frustrations in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed over the past ten years, the generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the coming years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both of these decisions that have not taken into account only the integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and availability of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turmoil on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect Romania's greater situation.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to face such complex situations.
Constantin Brancuşi, god of the country.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
"Take and kill the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to be famous, to hear about him all over the world.
Behind his reputation, however, there is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, set for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called trouble.
What do you write about Constantin Brancusi?
What else is it to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the banknote.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising moment.
Bracelets produce and deliver money for almost 60 years since it's no longer between us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear his name.
Otherwise, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when she comes out with the grown-up, she hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to Brancussi."
The country is surrounded by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to adults.
Brancusi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
No communists have been able to extract it from Romania's memory and culture.
His stories spread the Internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of Likes and Shares.
And then again, what would it be to say, to write about this man?
In view of the multitude of books and articles that are trying to rebuild his destiny, Brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, I'm those people who tell you that if you didn't have the luck of being born in a big city and in a family as hard as you can, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe there would be a key here.
Maybe from here we should start the next text.
With a sentence, however despicable it is.
Look at the success stories that are delivered to you every day on the newspaper and on TV.
Look closely at this man's figure.
Do you want to know how he managed in life, how, today, he heard a whole map world?
It's simple.
He worked all his life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brancuși was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobita, a small village in the municipality of Pestișani, Gorj County, at the Carpathian Poles.
He is the fifth child of Mary and Radu Nicolae Brancusi.
Although he came from a family of hardened countrymen, Brancussi led a modest life, but one of which was to collect his tracks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering the childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist had to witness, at a meeting with Petre Tützea, from Paris, 1933: "By then life was beautiful and harmonious".
For thousands of years, people have been leading, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything passed quietly from one time to another.
And you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
But Brancusi's childhood was far from an ideal.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent at home.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brancuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantine Brancusi was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when it was the casean, following those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was being conducted properly, Brancusi caught a moment of general neglect.
Fills her palm shells with corn and drinks on unsweetened.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people just notice after a few minutes.
Mom panics, then she gets married, believing her son died.
At night, when the father, Radu, comes back from life accompanied by praisers, he sees from a distance the desperate signs of those waiting for him with his soul to his mouth.
The party is turned into a jug.
Dad's already thinking about the funeral.
However, someone thinks it's good to call Baba Brändușa, the fragrance and the servant of the Bränkuşa.
The branch checks the child's breathing, then puts it under his horse's nose, collected nearby.
The strong alien child.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep further the bet, joy, party with cheerleaders continues with more and more strength.
The next day, the father and son meet through the living room.
Radu Brancusi put Constantin to collect some nude and bring them in.
The father puts the child's head down and, with the nipples brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while he feels the fatigue of the beatings, little Brancushi has the revelation that the world can be looked at and from another perspective and that things around him can appear twisted.
Especially the position of the sun, unlike the one known, makes him wonder how he should recognize old age if the star himself participates in his disorder.
Should the sun be as disturbed as his father by what happened to him?
At the current time, the city does not work
A parliamentarian calls on politicians to remember those who voted.
Independent Member Viorel Blajuţ called on the PSD and PNL to stop the internal battle and reorient the agenda to the electorate.
What we now see on our political scene is a great combination and so on.
I didn't see any of the 2012 USL projects to continue.
No highway, no Regional Emergency Hospital, you see only how politicians compete with their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let's just leave politics a little away, get together and talk.
At the current time, the city doesn't work.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," Blajut said.
He appreciated that the current political class had derailed the outgoing electorate, the consequence being a very low presence in the future local elections, around 30%, representing practically the party's faithful electorate.
The MP also believes that voters will continue to focus on traditional parties, expressing their reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "Pentru Iaşi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break out of the right electorate, not from the PSD.
Such parties are based on civilians, who are usually on the right.
"It makes even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," Blajut said.
He stated that he is not interested in a candidate for future local elections, discontinuing his intentions to enter the race for the Spring.
I said I don't want to run for any local function.
I wonder if you will continue as a Member in the future.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iaşi and in the talks on the halls, with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to imagine.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid enough to vote for us if I don't see anything," Blajutt said, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the electorate.
A colleague from Tatarasi said he couldn't get the money and he had to go on the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
There's no little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to raise money from the casino.
At the end of the term of office I will report on everything I have spent, in addition to the salaries and maintenance of employees from the cabinet.
I got up in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport, accommodation and other accounts.
"To tell a parliamentary that his money has not reached it is pure hypocrisy," Blajut concluded.
