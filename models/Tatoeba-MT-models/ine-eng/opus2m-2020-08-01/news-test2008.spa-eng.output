European inflation fell on food
The accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the veritable increase in the price of food products.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, recording, after 2.6 per cent of October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent, the Union Statistics Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only likely to give a 3 percent - Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuer banks, did not cut the basic interest, its assumption that the decrease, along with the price increases in raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to maintain the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not later have to intervene on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 per cent, recorded in Germany, struck the 12-year record, while in Spain it increased from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation was fired in the euro area as a result of galloping food and energy prices.
Grain quotas increased by 88 per cent and soybean quotas have reached their maximum level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased by 52 per cent this year, reaching black gold last month almost $100 per barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from 2.1 per cent current to 2.5 per cent, instead of 2009 will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months about 3 per cent, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup provides for a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by the beginning of December, the support of the Youth Democratic Alliance had increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while Gallup had never experienced such a low level - about 13 per cent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the party's safe voters - due to the strongest strength of the opposition voters - would mean support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) compared to support of one fifth for the Socialists (20 per cent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Free Democrats Alliance would not reach the necessary threshold for a parliamentary scan: their support within the entire population is two per cent.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest point in the past - it has never been so high, about 41 per cent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation particularly bad, while another 46 per cent believed that the situation was quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
With regard to the coming year, the majority of the population are facing a deterioration in the situation and only one tenth is expected to improve.
In December, 71 per cent of the consultants, a higher figure than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of the Government was doing better than his duties.
13 per cent of consultants trust or trust much in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has 38 per cent of consultants' support.
Approximately 54 per cent of the population does not fully trust the Chief of Government and a 27 per cent does not trust the president of the Youth Democratic Alliance.
One indicator of the political situation configuration is that, what proportion of society believes it is possible to control the discontent experienced in the face of the head of government without a change of government.
While after October last year ' s disturbances, 35 per cent felt that it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Chief of Government in power, this ratio is currently only about 20 per cent, while the relative majority (approximately 33 per cent) believe that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of respondents to the participation question replied that they would certainly participate and another 20 per cent said that they were likely to participate.
Comparatively, in "a general election to be held this Sunday", only 55 per cent of the population and another 15 per cent believe that they are likely to participate. Based on the current intentions of the voters, there is no doubt about the outcome of popular consultation.
About 74 per cent of the population would refuse the payment of study rights, 79 per cent of the medical consultation service and 84 per cent of the hospital attention.
If we only observe these proportions among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of study rights, the payment by medical consultations and hospital attention.
The most expensive is the Auchan, Tesco has five times its prices
They maintained the average increase in prices of 16 per cent of the supermarkets of the Budaörs gold trade triangle, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article of Napi Žyság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs gold commercial triangle the usual Christmas canada of the Napi daily, but in all supermarkets there was a much higher growth than in the thousands of HUFs.
As in December last year prices had already been "disappeared" in the supermarkets of food, a percentage drastic anchoring was not experienced compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obvious to consumers that what they were able to buy last year was much below the nine thousand HUFs, today they cannot do it even ten thousand.
The Napi canada in the studied hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 that canada cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in the strawberry, hazelnut and amapola seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data from the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we also found a kilogram of bread at the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of Coca-Cola with two litres of disposable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the Napi Auchan canada was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, regarding last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18 percent the prices in the Napi canada.
Comparing the values of the most expensive canada last year with that of the cheapest canada this year, the difference has been 12 per cent, while the growth between the cheapest last year and the most expensive one this year has been 21 per cent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during last year's Christmas in prices there was an increase in VAT.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, the supermarkets were apparently unable to decide on the margin of prices to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of the change of prices on consumption.
(If the trader misplanes the speed of movement of a product, it may lose a significant benefit on the margin adjusted to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi canada reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which was the most expensive with 1720 HUF at the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year no such extremes occurred, as the highest price from now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Compared with the two Christmas season, a catastrophic increase in prices was recorded in less than 20 months, in the supermarkets more than 30 percent increased the price of first-needed consumer goods.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistical Office: this office, in the case of some first-needed foods, recorded an increase of more than 30 per cent in the 12-month period.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to the Napi basket, in this last case this seems almost impossible, because at the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case, only 10 percent price increase.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than eggs, which can impose the dramatic price increase even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trade triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experience, most of the consumers of the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Out of all the products they buy large quantities, carrying the preserved foods by pallets.
In the morning of Wednesday, large queues were formed in the three shops in front of the boxes because it suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that within the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to the survey institutes because income remains below their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals saves with disinfectants
This year several thousand infections caused primarily by the improper application of antibiotics have been registered in hospitals.
Health conditions prevailing in hospitals, bed-laying and overloading of staff do not favour infection control - says the medical head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many hospitals it is even saved with disinfectants.
Not long ago, a infection with MRSA has been diagnosed in the traumatology department of the János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of bacteria resistant to antibiotics was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A serious car accident was injured and the same patient had to return to the hospital shortly after having been infected with MRSA and since then there has been no significant surgical intervention by the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, cases of hospital infection by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 - said Karolina Böröcz, head of Department of National Epidemiology Centre.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has been safely recorded, and there is no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, which is resistant to methicillin-oxacilin.
One third of human beings carry in their nose the bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) without causing any disease.
The infections caused by the SA (e.g., inflammation of the throat, amigdalitis, skin infections, infections of wounds) respond well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once applied excessively or improperly to antibiotics, bacteria that normally respond well to antibiotics become very resistant bacteria to antibiotics and are rapidly infected under inadequate hospital conditions.
Serious hospital infections, such as infections of wounds or septicaemia, may be caused primarily in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with weakened body, in the elderly or in those with low weight.
According to the medical director of Hospital János, there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, these infections are everyday in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotics resistant
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff take care of them in rubber and mask gloves and there are the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are examined in advance to verify the presence of MRSA in your body, but not even so, infection can be avoided in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital infections in most cases, but current national hospital conditions do not favour prevention of formation and infection with multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA into their body.
However, in Hungarian hospitals there is no fashionable use of microbiological samples.
This fact is also due to the failure of the National Health Fund to fund these medical examinations.
So most of the cases go public when there are already visible MRSA infections in the patient - said the head of the department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict recommendations for the implementation of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological paintings.
Antibiotic therapy should be directed, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance to drugs, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is still less frequent in the case of patients on the outpatients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
Saving with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through healthcare.
Therefore, they play a very important role in washing hands, using rubber gloves and masks, but also in this regard there are considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is infected by the transmission of drops and direct contact between persons, but it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient in national hospital conditions.
Moreover, the hospital rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very together, although in order to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, you can also experience - added Karolina Böröcz - that in the less favourable economic situation hospitals saves with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that is why there is a greater likelihood of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate prevention measures are being implemented, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the infection of the pathogen agent may be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, which is why it is being fought against in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
The programme appears to be successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a downward trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative control of the police commander's alcoholism caused by a fatal accident
The official report on the fatal accident caused by the commander of the 21st District Police has been made.
It can be excluded that he was driving drunk or in a state of shock since then dismissed the commander of the 21st District Police, who had attacked and caused the death of a passerby - Attila Morvai, spokesperson for the General Prosecutor of the Capital, reported on Friday after preparing the report on the case.
The periphery report confirmed the result of the primary control of alcoholism that it had already found that the former police commander had not consumed alcohol before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then chief of the police station of District XXII, Tuesday with his private vehicle when he doubled the Kossuth Lajos street of District XXII, attacked a 55-year-old man who wanted to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian zone.
(This last fact, i.e. that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not attenuating circumstances, the driver must always give up the step by bending.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police chief resigned and applied for his retirement, according to the police report, because he was greatly moved by the case.
The case investigation is under the responsibility of the Budapest Research Office.
Attila Morvai also said that from the beginning, the former police commander cooperated with the prosecutors responsible for the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit threshold agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total value of EUR 400 million to finance educational, transport and environmental infrastructures as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget the transport and environmental protection projects, which will be covered by the Cohesion Fund subsidy, from which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement of EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed with respect to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary's objective, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, to be decided at a later date by extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a 50 million-euro contract for innovation, which the budget will use mainly for the project of innovation and research at the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the topic of construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary lasts with the EU the details of the Metro funding, they would re-examine the subject whether or not it was necessary to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the loans is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers an 8-year grace period, without charging a commission to keep the loan available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, EU real estate
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is remarkable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and who buy even cheaper in the EU market, will quickly get stuck?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
The preferred goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments on ski slopes and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most popular, while on the Albena beaches, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will also be able to awaken the interest of real estate promoters and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Russia.
The capital of Sofia can also be attractive, commercial spaces and offices promise a quick recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of Europe's most attractive golf courses, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, careful investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, who buy real estate in Bulgaria, they also strive to change their life and their way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in ski resorts.
Foreign clients can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who want to install here buy new or renovated buildings at a price between EUR 50 and 100 000 or old houses in bad condition between EUR 5 and 15 000, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, and they also care about the proximity of a large city, shops and generally of a local doctor.
The second category consists of chalets buyers (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of Germans).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases with the hope that they will benefit in the medium to long term.
The price of capital properties is growing steadily, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these have suffered an annual increase of 21%
The increase in the price of buildings significantly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and six per cent Hungarian
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, meetings at expert level will be completed on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening will continue the ministerial negotiations on the post-2012 international climate regime.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world were discussing the Balí Route Sheet, which was available on subsequent efforts to reduce emissions, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, which was in force until 2012.
There are lively discussions on the particular situation between developing countries and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that for the time being it does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to agree that, compared to the 1990 situation, by 2020, greenhouse gas emissions will fall by 25 to 40 per cent.
Another major theme of the conference is that if industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are or are not willing to provide material and technological assistance to countries that need it.
A further agreement was reached on aid to developing countries.
The support fund provided for in the Kyoto Protocol will be directed by a 16-member management board, probably within the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes "Piac es Profit".
Six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for the Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to preserve its vanguard role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU undertakes to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020, whether or not the "after-2012 agreement" will be signed, and is willing to undertake to reduce even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in line with their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signing countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to a fall of 5.2 per cent, within which the 15 EU Member States committed to a fall of 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent over the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will meet - points to the press release from the Ministry of the Environment.
That is a lot at stake in Balí, since within two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force will be delayed by after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments entered into in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, whose need was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the international scientific association of the United Nations dealing with climate change, which received the Nobel Peace Prize.
The reduction of emissions would therefore be delayed and an increase of more than 2°C of the earth ' s average temperature could not be prevented, as scientists believe it would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army Recruited on YouTube
The units of the British army in a video distributor publish recordings about actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on helmets are controlled in the general body of Kandahar operations, then sent to London to be loaded on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been loaded in this way on the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of actions carried out in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the British Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force had loaded the videos with recruitment goals, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence, they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda is practically nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots - the expert in defense of the BBC, Gordon Mackenzie, said - in return, inevitably have some political messages, since in a specific way they justify the reason for the military actions decided by the government.
Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the recordings carefully edited and censored, there are also popular videos in the distributor, such as about the death of soldiers: in the films of "official" propaganda, a few hypocrites, officers speak as much of loss, but not the bloody part of the fight.
In addition, many videos recorded in real operations have been uploaded to the Internet from the battle camps in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruiting with video shooting games, downloadable for free, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can directly replace the soldiers.
Tombol and pastel salad at the Christmas party of the ministries
It does not seem very sentimental to the Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to fire in 2007 with salad and coffee pastel.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its festival with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a toast and a toast.
Party, Christmas environment, concerts and buffets - so you share power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the workers of the Ministry.
The children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts at the Orphans' Christmas and for the Missionary's Christmas they are invited to the families of the soldiers who are currently carrying out missions abroad. A reception will also be offered for the press.
This portfolio will be allocated 25 million for the holiday environment of the end of the year.
The National Agency for Development (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held in the Future House, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and the 60 ministerial workers expected to be present for approximately three hundred and fifty.
At the portfolio party you will reign an atmosphere of Christmas, you will also perform artists and you will have a choice of toast.
The ANF vessel cost 4,700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the National Council for the Administration of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The room rental cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the employees of one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party which will be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
To this end, they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by the CHDE SA, as we have not been able to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without clothes
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead celebrated the dance of Lucía on December 7th.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Fifty people took part in the dance.
The party began with the Minister's words of greeting and after dinner there was dancing music in live.
Answering the [origin] question they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear clothing or nightwear.
Health, work and local administration portfolios are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a programme and party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth does not expect his colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year working meeting.
It is with the participation of hundreds of 80 guests who - as the press department reported - will only take coffee and salad pastel, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
On the other hand, the Minister for Local Governments Gordon Bajnai will simply provide his colleagues in the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development class.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own chamber of events with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - this budget will pay the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse but also by the afternoon of its celebration.
The farm portfolio will offer a New Year reception on January 20th, the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and as the portfolio has been informed, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundreds of guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception of foot, to which only specialised diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting of the Minister and end with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the respective press departments communicated to [origin].
The Department of the Press of the Environment portfolio was unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's annual celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike met
The League Unions and the National Federation of Working Commissions will be a strike committee on Friday to coordinate the strike of the moon that will last indefinitely.
A half-day of protest will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will take place - will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, as rail traffic will be stopped completely and workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be in strike by 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday, which will be held jointly with the National Federation of Working Commissions.
The Liga strike committee and the National Machineist Union will also be set up to coordinate Monday's actions.
Saturday will be a half-day of protest, while the participating trade unions will be pronounced in a strike on Monday for an indefinite period, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike.
If the National Assembly rejects the public health law, trade unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Assembly Monday, it is also possible to vote only on the public health law at very late hours of the night, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike to be launched on Monday, there will be significant transport difficulties: the railways will stop working for an indefinite period, in the morning a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the interurban transport of buses from Volán companies will appear.
At the same time, at many points in the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Many unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, and their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike for an indefinite time, others for a defined time.
By the afternoon of Thursday, the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach agreement on the minimum services, but when Christmas parties are approaching, more and more people are traveling on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m., workers from the Budapest Collective Transport Company, Budapest Airports from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., will celebrate a four-hour strike by the LIGA Associations of the Electric Industry and Thermal Energy, the Educators Unions called for a 2-hour strike and the Democratic Union of the Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association will be pronounced in a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) who are part of the Trade Cooperation Forum will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims made by the League is that the government withdraws its proposal for public health reform and submits a new concept to a social debate.
The second requirement is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will enter into force in the coming year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, that in the case of advanced pensions, occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway sidelines and await another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: The Hungarian Guard increases the risk in the country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Policy Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August of this year with the support of the Better Hungary Movement, have increased from a number of points of view the political risk of Hungary and the region.
The company's "risk warning" states: in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity, the biggest political risk is that "with the worsening of the ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsian populations in Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic clashes may occur".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to provoke an event of this nature - he added the representative of the Research Institute.
They said that all this was due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political life's protagonists: "The protagonists of public life gave the public debate on the gypsy problem to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the differences between gypsies and Hungarians."
This exacerbates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
Moreover, according to the Institute of Research, the activities of the National Guard, as a result of the high attention of the national and international media, "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, especially as regards the country's stability and democratic development".
They remind us that: from the fall of 2006, it has received increasing publicity and boosted the reorganization of the radical and extremely right-wing groups of Hungary and that since the summer of 2007, numerous organizations have been formed in the country, which are self-defined by "national self-defence associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they self-defined themselves as civil organizations, as they openly proclaim the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defence, public order defence), alluding to the ineptities of the police, the army, i.e. the State" - adding.
They said that all this was done in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with politics and political parties.
It is possible to highlight the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid legal problems of legal registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring States have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the Institute of Research, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a similar way as the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) on the far right.
The formation of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to be a guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "gitano terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - he recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has led to lively discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes which certain Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced will be their own guard to resist.
Since the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defence - it can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
Political Capital Research Director Attila Juház asked the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that may influence the change of risk, they inform the public opinion, as in this case, of their warning about the risks.
The party isn't always written with red numbers
In Hungary, the law accurately defines the days written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a generalized practice around the holidays - that the next year will be less - the working days will be reorganized.
Not even in the EU or North America are united parties.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national party, State party and holidays.
Feasting days are fundamentally related to religious festivals and historical ephemeries.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is festive - this last one especially so that those who have spent the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national festival on 15 March in memory of the 1848 revolution and on 23 October, a commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August we celebrated the founding of the State, on 1 May the Labour Party, on 1 and 2 November we remembered our families and lost friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day parties to the Easter Day, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious parties rarely coincide with an end of the week, so it often becomes bridge when there is one working day before or after the party.
In exchange for the weekends so extended, work or school cannot be absent during the previous Saturdays.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day immediately preceding or after the party.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory for companies and service institutions that, because of their function, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the order of work can only be changed around the holidays of the end of the year: from 24 December life is practically stopped in the country, because according to experience, most people "make bridges" during the holidays between Christmas and the end of the year or take their vacations during these days.
The next year several of our parties will coincide with averages or weekends, so there will be less changes in working days than this year.
The agenda will first be changed around the work party so that the workers can rest for four consecutive days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, so that on Friday, May 2, it will be a festive day.
The other change relates to the festival of 23 October: Saturday, 18 October, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year that comes during the end of the year may be restable, since from 24 December it will not work in almost any place, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little dissatisfactions to make your colleagues' life bitter
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never received, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing: they are all part of our daily Folklore at work.
You have to decide whether to adjust to small troubles or deliberately avoid situations that may irritate others.
Tips.
I'm sorry, if you forgot to let me know you've been looking for you from the marketing department" - says one of your colleagues.
Why didn't you go to an appointment?
In the best of cases you feel it and try to repair the matter, call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before you do a lot of explaining, you deserve to meditate on the things with which you can make your colleagues' life bitter and to make a conscious effort to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than when you want to grab a document, an office utility or your phone and you don't find them.
Do you remember that you put the grabber on the table yesterday, but this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your wallet lost at the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they'll be mad at you for pulling away their stuff.
Don't scratch over or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need it immediately and they're exhausted before time.
Are you talking about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information you have about your colleagues' private life!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
You understand in yourself what you have heard and don't whisper about your colleague in his absence, even though others also know the things about him.
Are you going to get a license for an unjustified disease?
When you call the office by phone and say you're sick and unbearable, you feel bad or well, you feel that you prefer to rest that day; you think that others should do your job, your unbearable tasks, your work at the end.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or you may have something to do, so you should stay at home, communicate, so that your colleagues or your boss don't have to confront you the next day.
Tarares, laughs, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but do you suddenly get rid of it?
Have you ever heard of an involuntary phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your tarares, songs, loud talk (less when you do them over their heads), patals, constant blasphemy, expressing your discontents in a loud voice.
All of these may be disturbing, although they are not currently deepening in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you've forgotten to send an important letter or a message!
You don't like the chaos that may exist in the office, or the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Jogging and shoes: Very comfortable home, but not suitable for the office!
You don't see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be undressed, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so requires!
Loss of interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual morning.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm up the volume.
Change the rhythm of music and the previous tones add the low and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 reproduces the song Wings of Love from Zagar.
National music life didn't hurt us very much by e-pop quality.
But now it seems completely different when you're listening to the new Zagar album.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national gradually changed the image and although the rock style garage is again fashionable, guitar breaks, the national pop electro has shown: there are news under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi group until he started his independent career perhaps because they cannot both be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried triumph, when he was asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographics (pl.
Ferenc Trök season).
The wider audience knew the whole that in principle acted only in small clubs when the wan2 magazine selected its first album published in 2002 among the 50 most important national records, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, able to sell itself also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his set are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether they wear this label or not.
The set responded how it should react: it prepared a new and even better disc.
The recently released disc, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, can open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
Because this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zságer.
The reference to the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airy music, now appeared - according to the spirit and the trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenary György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the whole The Puzzle.
The album includes a true success of the channel Mr.2 Petõfi that last broadcasts from the morning to the night of popular music. This station brought to the radio audience the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Because everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: What is your interpretation, to what extent is music dedicated to a selected audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of selected public means little to me.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
The so-called underground alternative music can also be boring, meaningless and can also be composed only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: In the foreign world, especially in the western part of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There not only the 15-year-old generations attend the concerts, but also the oldest ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that are taking place around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What function does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are, and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good to see more and more people attending our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We don't make music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you are losing your interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and made his career to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don't follow his way, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with that of him.
Instead, we work on the team, trust in the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first it was inevitable to compare our work with Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in their group and there we started another way.
hvg.hu: In the list of success Mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Did you deliberately open this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to make great successes and sell with these successes our disk.
This song is more than that.
We add it at the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the most heavy themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gosball-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of soloists with a good voice from our own national music scene.
This was created by six women's choir - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was then baptized as the Divine of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you just compose the song or girls changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song has been in instrumental version for a long time and when we already had all the material on the disc, we think something is still missing.
The agreement attracted the song.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came almost to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I also needed the Divines.
With my voice, I wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the disc it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's short only), they don't have their own role, they all sing together and not more strongly than music, so music doesn't just accompany their songs.
Also on the stage are located at the bottom.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
We did not want, however, to distribute roles of soloists.
The song also pours on it, on which we forget a moment of our ego, who comes from where and where it goes, so let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have liked to have others feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which job have you dedicated more?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition really none, but at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to work the groove and then, gradually everything became its place as a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new disc?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I have already released the disc.
Now the Prophet is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A stockbroker riskes billions of dollars for his inferiority complex
An unfaithful villain.
This is how your former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the giant French banker of Société Generale, also owns the Czech Trade Bank.
He lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself with his colleagues and certainly with good abilities.
Intuited long ago, unlike all the major Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was left to hear from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's responses, according to what French media broadcasts, such as the Le Monde newspaper, is that it was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than EUR 1.6 billion thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank" he said in his answers.
Exactly, in the summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, EUR 500 million.
This opportunity has already come at the beginning of the year.
In February they began to hear some news about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that these customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I already won my first 500 million I don't know how to report it," Kerviel confesses, adding, that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had faked the records in such a way that it would not reach its discovery.
He even deceived the bosses, even though the Eurex bag began to take an interest in his business.
The risk became a benefit
Did you fear he'd find out?
Better, no.
"I thought I had won 1,600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did you get so much willpower to risk it that way?
In my position, I had to work gradually.
He joined the General Society in 2000, just after he finished studying in Lyon.
His annual salary was managed between $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an associate of the Stock Exchange and in 2005 he became a stock exchange with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I'd never win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I already noticed that I was being watched carefully.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described the researchers.
But soon my entry into the company was the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the attacks with bombs in London, playing at the bottom a €500 million title.
And this assumed a start-up mechanism, and I wanted more.
If you want it, let's leave you.
"This is like a snowball," said the police.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or that they were rather suspicious.
"As he made money, he closed his eyes."
Only then came the blow at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost billions of euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, I wanted to erase all traces.
When Monday came to work, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did they manage to locate him?
He became a suspect from his holidays.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The walker who has no holidays is a walker who doesn't want anyone looking at his file," Kerviel finished.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of reaching 365 billion
The Czech Government ministers signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can reach EUR 14 billion (approximately SEK 365 billion).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
There will be approximately 125 billion crowns for regions from seven operational programmes.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain approximately 100 billion crowns from the Company and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be spent on transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State transport infrastructure fund, which will amount to 90,800 million crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources for business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, industrial research and the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the most recently-used countries.
Twenty-year sentence for Nicaraguan former president, court decree
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals sentenced the country's ex-president, Arnaldo Alemán, 20 years on Thursday, who was sentenced in 2003 for the loss of $10 billion (almost $1,800 million).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison to be arrested at home in his farm near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP agency, that then the head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002 is back in the ranks.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will depend more on prison officials if they let Germany end their sentence at home or if they send him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed that Germany was constantly transferring government money to a company in Panama.
This society was fiction and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that Germany created to finance its campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how the budget was adopted.
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by most of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget has already been approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD that it could not be accepted.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the government's confidence vote, nothing dramatic has happened this time.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, quietly passed the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and budget departure, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics, but it conceals the rivalry of power between government and opposition.
It is important for the media and is therefore given special attention.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats have suffered from three defects that it is not possible to resolve so easily for this year 2008:
The first of these is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenditures of officials who are not only pensioners but also social benefits that were approved before last year's elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the economic deficit as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
However, the clock bomb is in the municipal and community budget deficit.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the bank's taxes, fees and credits, often issued disproportionately disproportionate obligations to their municipalities.
In recent years, they have managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks that they have received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we focus only on the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, a few years ago, goes through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, what is called ČSSD.
This was the perfect opportunity for his government to order the state's finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to owe it.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to nations that are less threatened by poverty within the framework of global measures.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which have unfortunately been implicated in enormous measures in recent years.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist expenditures adopted this year before the elections, if they did not soon change the retirement age and pension reform then it would be the end of any policy in this country and, the government that rules will only be a simple bureaucracy.
By exaggerating a little, we can say that the politicians who rule will become officials, mechanical distributors of most of the money from retirement taxes and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure on the normal expenditures of the mandate officers.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the last government had not wasted over the last ten years what they could.
We do not want politicians who rule to become officials only for this reason we should be patient and give this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what is capable of obtaining taxes and taxes, the calmness of preparing other reforms of the laws.
Only this will allow the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
More than $100 billion will be received in the Monetary Market through tenders.
In these tenders, banks undermine the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, American Fed will send $40 billion to bid, and then another $24 billion will be facilitated by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that central banks of different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continued growth of the free capital shortage that banks could provide," wrote Bernard Baumohl in his report to customers from the Consultant Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action by the central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $6 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions of losses.
"The central banks must really be afraid of what awaits them even when they decided to take this step," said ABN Amro's chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems like the situation is really bad," he added.
The central banks fear that they have the same problems of accessing loans and that they will have to lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to the recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after not being able to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London Interbank rate used for the money loan on the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall of interest," said to the agency Reuters, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks contributes to the start of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Economists' debates are incredible
Global climate change affects, in particular, developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed himself on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now emerged with the closure of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between rhetoric used and reality.
"There the debates are only structured, they are artificial fires of words, replacing the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy to discover his book translated into German because as he said, "I often meet only with the cartoon of my ideas."
The interested parties can now be informed about their multifaceted opinions.
Klaus remembered that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough supposed to write a book like this.
It is academic, capable of following and judging a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of closure he expressed his view that the climate changed constantly and that its changes were normal, that there was no agreement between scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes were not so great and serious, nor represented possible disasters, and that attempts to influence climate development were ineffective, ineffective and cost-effective.
In addition, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, it is unacceptable to impose untested opinions on others, which feels as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
He repeatedly explained that he was not opposed to "reasonable environmental defenders but to environmental militants who do not take into account the cost-benefit relationship".
Same topic Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600 thousand people didn't get to change their driver's meat.
Six hundred thousand drivers passed the date and therefore did not reach the end of the year to change their old sheep to drive.
Today is the last day when people can ask for the change so that officials can spend time with them until the end of the year in issuing the new sheep.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the new Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be found on the roads without the proper meat.
According to traffic, sheep have not changed mainly those who do not even want to drive.
While peoples announce a rapid decline in meat exchange, metropolis offices are full of requests and the interest in the new meat has increased.
The City is estimated to be around 2,000 customers per day.
There's a half an hour waiting in the queues.
In Prague the new sheep has not yet been taken out of about 140,000 drivers.
The release of a new sheep lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of meat within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay fifty crowns.
Drivers who must change their meat and do not reach the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the proper meat will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay up to two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the crime with a warning.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine shall amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a fine could be imposed on that person who is not going anywhere.
They could probably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry called on offices to enter moderately fines of a thousand crowns, as a maximum.
According to the voice of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of thousands of crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, driving meat is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the meat of identity that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the meat to drive.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to municipal offices.
At the end of the year, meat issued during 1964 and 1993 ceased to be valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of meat to drive.
Persons with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the meat issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the punishment for Berdych's compulsive detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided, as a final result, to reduce penalties, first to one year, and second to two years.
The Department's detectives were opposed to organized crime and were about to fall, in principle, from 14 to 12 years.
Today's decision cannot be appealed, only through the revocation of the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also in this accused case but he is first awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this in other proceedings, a total of 16 years has already been sentenced.
You can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement in the recruitment of 19 persons and the Supreme Court, today, revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accused's accusations were rejected by the investigation because of the alleged causes.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police in accordance with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered the thefts, and helped members of the criminal group to avoid punishment.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their clothes and Opava and Konňarík.
The charge relates to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
With regard to theft, their victims suffered serious health impacts but were also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without the permission of weapons.
In the home register, the police found guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals reportedly stole tens of millions of crowns.
With the exception of almost twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other accused.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pót and Maroš Šuljej, who have for the time being avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
An account for changing children: 12 million
To change some children in the Maternity House the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the Trebič hospital 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is not in principle in line with Veleba's proposal.
"We don't approve this request, it's too high," said Dostál after today's meeting.
"In order to make an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the expert's report that the counterparty sent to investigate.
We'll see if it has a calorific value.
We keep in mind that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," said Dostál.
The amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloň family wanted, for each month that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was served as the basis for negotiating the compensation of the expert's report, only it was prepared at Motol School Hospital in Prague.
The parents of girls according to specialists in psychology and psychology suffered from psychological impact and stress at different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better endured by men, although they were struggling with recruitments for the change of girls.
Women are bringing him worse with the trauma they are currently living and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses in the Maternity House of Trebič last year, December nine.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Chermakový in Pribyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloný.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered 100 000 crowns to each family at the end of October as compensation for the error in the Trebič hospital the region administers.
All the hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured as liability for damages.
In the event of errors, they must withdraw from the reserve fund and may request assistance from the administrator.
To date, the court has recognized them as relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables of hundreds of thousands and exceptionally of a million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the argument about the Kingdom of Valaquia brand.
According to the Ostrava Provincial Court judge, he was the first to use the Valaquia Kingdom brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polivka was not presented today in the oral view.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will resort.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said after the trial, Polívka's lawyer.
For him, in front of the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, everyone comes the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been after us for about ten years.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the dispute is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A profit-making business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Valaquia brand was first used by Polívka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
So it was not about guiding him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš had to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From this comedian origin came a lucrative business and business activity from which Harabiš created after the Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed on the use of its name and signed the passports and even offered its owners discounts to visitors of its farm and visitors to its shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on the stage for its own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who were completely committed to it.
The collaboration, among today's uncomposed parties, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation in Vsetin for Polívka.
Since then, there have been conflicts between Polívka and Harabiš, whose culmination has come with the overthrow of the "King Boleslav I, elected forever".
The main role in the kingdom, by means of Harabiš, was derived from the singer Jarmila Šulaková, as mother queen.
In 2002, Polívka filed a charge against Harabiš and his society that has been rejected by the court so far.
Something of course could bring in the dispute, the tournament by the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
You did not want to disclose any more data or dates.
"We don't have any rush.
It should be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can present himself," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VT: Overrun prejudices
To tell the truth, I never liked Peugeotu 206 too much.
Its walking characteristics were never special, the quality of the change box, manoeuvre and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now there is in the market your successor, the Peugeot 207, and this, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a bit more advanced and to me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the head space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because Combi's bodywork means in this sense, that I'm not going to suffer in front of the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I pass through the interior quickly to not repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate the design invention even though the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times where we complained about short seats and back.
In contrast to model 206, lateral direction has also improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the measures of the bodywork have grown.
In the Combi the quoted lack of space in the head disappears.
Packets in the Packet
But the main thing in this vehicle is your suitcase.
This must be valued as very accessible ( thanks to the rear accessable port) and a well-distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber belts that provide an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can extend to the point of subjecting heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, the basic regime has a capacity of 428 litres, which is rather a medium value compared to competition.
But not compared to the same type of vehicle sold in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we will find that Peugeot stays at the saw with its 52 litres.
From vacations abroad or by placing the child's cochetoit its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I should quote the floor that remains pretty flat after the back of the second line.
120 horses in four moves
Our vehicle test was equipped with a four-valve injection fire on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, it's like it should look like a 1600 who underestimated the family's five doors.
It's quiet, it consumes little and above all, it has impulse.
If I compare it to the time of the shells then it seemed as if the escape tube was stuck by a trap, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The car price is not for all pockets.
We must, however, take into account that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with an injection fire of 1400 by 329.900 crowns is still possible.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The type of Premium tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in our heads, automatic air conditioning, automatic cleaning, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
That's a lot, but it's got the team's plugins in the Fabia and it'll get to a pretty similar number.
Now it's only left to decide which of the two marks.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
In English schools, children from countries of Eastern Europe attend and that is why locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between migrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and brats between students have already reached even their own parents.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green rod.
In his defense, he said that the girl was insulting her child with racist tone.
The police also had to act after an attack by two younger girls against a Slovak immigrant.
The girls waved at him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and began to spit on us.
When I told him to leave it, he gave us the breath of throwing apples and feathers, and then he took off his pants and showed us his back" described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are on both sides.
One native even designated the conflict with migrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks registered who came here for labour reasons.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holidays can be accomplished, whenever you choose correctly.
Plays arenas and golden, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
palm trees and all enclosed with shrimps offering pizzas on the beach, ice creams or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, the golf course of the roulette.
In the Caribbean Sea Island you can find all this and much more.
Only in one island there is much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the fortress of the conquest of America.
Colon called her, the most beautiful place human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and port of cargo of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew in the late 20s.
He ordered him to build one of the heads of the American mob, Lucky Luciano, because everything that had to do with crime in the U.S. (and therefore banned) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Among their guests were:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings emerged, with avenues running the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and Cojimar had his yacht.
In the walls of the Middle Bodeguita, they left their signatures the stars of the world of the show and politicians of all America.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita avanes you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel National mixes the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already in worship in the 1950s, to this day, continue to work for Havana, because those Lada and Fiat who arrived a long time ago have oxidized between these wet and wind salads.
Even when La Habana, especially the old neighborhood, is deteriorating significantly, there are not in the surrounding as many wonderful colonial monuments as there.
Other places are metamorphosis in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the single world and is highly appreciated by the lovers of railway.
The sugarcane is transported from huge plantations to sugar factories through narrow lines in steam or electric machines.
Their cars for decades have not been discovered and they are now there, machines that work and whose brotherly models that are in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where are you going?
The most famous place for most visitors does not change.
And that's why we don't need to talk about La Habana or Varadero anymore.
Perhaps, just remember that in the already mentioned Hemingway farm there is a museum that for those who are writers' lovers, they should not stop visiting it.
The valley of Vignales is Cuba's most picturesque corner west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in rocky rock soils.
Mogots, chalice stone pillars and high cliffs in the valley falls, and in their caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where tobacco of the highest quality is probably cultivated in Cuba.
Visiting any of the pure Havana factories can be found with your final product.
It may seem interesting to someone that there was the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinidad
A town of old natives that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth became beautiful with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who later arrived, has only changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Serra of Escambray, is such a quiet place that in the 50s of the last century there was no road to join it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the way.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the vicinity such as the Ancon Beach or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which encourages the silence of the mornings with its music.
Baracoa
Small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as through a nature that only knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the Cross of Colon (in fact it is a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where there was the castle and that now there is a hotel with its own name, you can see the mountains and among them the most famous, the Yunque.
Coffee, rones, pures, Sierra Maestro, Bay of the Cochinos and the island of Pinos, Cabaret Tropicana, the patron of Cuba, the Virgin of the Cobra Charity, the Santeria, the African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, all of which could be filled with many pages.
However, as it is said, it is better to see it sometime.
Allys are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is affecting the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Minister of Defence Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan was not as it were, the representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country met in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to become more active, Britain sees as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the allocation of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population that they can only start economic and security development," the minister of defence, Des Browne, told BBC.
Ninety per cent.
The activity of Afghan rebels according to US military data is greater than in the past five years.
The number of violent actions grew in comparison with the last year in 27 per cent, and in the Helmand province up to 60 per cent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, one quarter of whom are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of unit organization and equipment.
They are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar way, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
"I am not glad to know what we have in the earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have a ninety percent of soldiers and teams we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told the agency Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
Among the participating countries in recent months is the controversy of whether all allies do their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticised for passively.
"Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the requirements of fighting there are not as high as in our, south and east of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun, this week called the German soldiers blind.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing the table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops were playing a rugby party in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach the billion in 2009
For each Czech country, the State owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted to SEK 842,700 million in September.
This year the government planned to borrow 159,200 million crowns.
However, at the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan to SEK 152,800 million by improving the state budget economy.
The Czech Republic's state debt rose by the end of September to SEK 842,70 billion.
In nine months this year it increased by 40,200 million crowns.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.400 million crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of the Economy confirmed its data on the debt of the state of principle in October.
For each Czech, the debt is 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the State owed more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year, we could cross the boundary of the billion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 90 billion and the billion crowns," said to the iHNed.cz server, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, sees it: "We could pass the Billion during 2009.
That is exactly when that will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If the situation in the changing political scene and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But I don't see such a change," he added.
Doubt Grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and, above all, arises from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The debt of the state is paid by means of bonds of the treasure, bonds of the state, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt grew from 38,500 million to 719,400 million crowns this year.
The external debt so far has grown from 1,700 million crowns to 123,300 million crowns.
The so-called state debt at the end of September contained 803,300 million z crowns since June was reduced to 13,700 million crowns.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt from the first to the third quarter creates a 13 per cent which is enormous given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from obligations where there is a 20% growth.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it is going to negotiate until there is a pension reform" said Pikora.
Better Than Expected
Out of the state debt strategy and management for 2007, it is clear that the government planned to borrow 159,200 million crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan by SEK 152,800 million thanks to the improvement of the state budget.
The amount consists, in particular, of the deficit in the state budget that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the planned 91,300 million crowns.
The rest consists of maximum planned resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency with approximately 13.300 million crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for pension payments, 43 billion crowns to finance state obligations and 1,800 million crowns in payments from the European Investment Bank's loans.
He compared today before a court in Khartoum to have given a name to a bear of fur
The British professor who was tried in Sudan for insulting Islam has been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, said his lawyer.
Britain was accused of letting students between 6 and 7 years of age give Mahomet's name to a bear when all representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was a pain in the ass.
This 54-year-old British school teacher under the United High School in Khartoum in the Sudan has been detained on Sunday in his home and accused of assaulting Islam and sedentary, under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints from students' parents to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class bear.
" Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children of every 23 have chosen Mohamed as their favorite name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in the Sudan.
Then the children have produced a book for the class with the bear photo with the following legend " My name is Mohamed " .
The bear himself--he carried no label with that name, but the problem is simply the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues from Gillian Gibbons, a professor at the same school in the Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything offensive to a religious faith, " I am sorry that he had asked children to vote for a name " , according to him only an " innocent error " .
Opinion divided by numerous students from the school teacher who describe her as " very attentive to her students " and " who never talks about religion in class ".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most known name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, an issue of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have finished a sixth and last session of discussions in Baden in Austria on Wednesday, without having been able to overcome their differences about the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake " , its American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not anticipate violence for now but enter a very difficult period " , he added, pointing out that " obvious tensions exist " .
End of mediation on 10 December
Troika mediators, regrouping the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province of 90 per cent of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council from 10 December to 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final meeting of negotiations since the troika had been tasked with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
The US and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond that date.
" Russia was and was committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of UN Kosovo administration, the West consider independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
" Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority Fatmir Sejdiu at the Baden hotel where these "last opportunity negotiations" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has been a part of his weight.
But he added that Belgrade's plan of autonomy "belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations".
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered a commitment always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said in particular to fear a " dominant effect " in a region still weakened by the 1990s ' independence wars.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a right of veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
" These negotiations have lasted for two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of Albanian independence would be made " in consultation " with the West.
Bush launches an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference held by him on Tuesday to Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and the Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to enter into negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old quarrelling point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them complete a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructures " and Israel must put an end to their colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both parties of their obligations regarding the peace route they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would seek " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This designation covers the three main problems of the contentious point between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be " global and in-depth" and referred to in all aspects of a regulation, citing " Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things " .
On his return to the court, Olmert was committed to what the negotiations would be "direct and continuous" and to making "an effort to complete them in the course of 2008.
At the end of 2008, Bush set the end of its " two-State vision " of the Palestinian and Israeli coexistence.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment to this part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, led by all Arab countries, which proposes peace for Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects " , Prince Saoud estimates in his Arabic regular interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police aren't responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As often as in this type of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the French National Police Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after the 17th Louisa-Miguel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
" He was not in intervention but on patrol, and he was traveling 40-50 km/h without a rotating light," explains a police source.
A green bike from the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorised to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " to all gas " .
" He stabbed the police car on the left, after a failure to move to the right " , the police say.
The control of alcoholism practiced on the occupants of the vehicle was shown to be negative.
The state of the car (the grounded front, rusted parachutes, booted parachocks) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " acts of involuntary murder and denial of aid " to the IGPN, co-operated with the Departmental Directorate of Public Security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor stated that IGPN's investigation at this stage had dismissed the responsibility of the police.
According to the three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, they confirmed " the version of the police, to know that this minimum bike arrived relatively quickly to their left " .
Yesterday, a type of sloth, no doubt caused by the flotting of the shoes on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been framed in time for the police car to stop.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated by Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have gone very quickly from the site, thus not providing support to both young people.
The IGPN, being cautious, would also remove " any serious lack " from this point.
" It is the most difficult aspect of research, which needs more research, which must be very careful about," said a police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that have followed the accident.
One of your windows that exactly gives the scene.
"We went down then, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them, tell this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw "a completely disappointed police officer, who was squeezing.
Two others were trying to cheer up one of the young, the room was talking to the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently with the certainty that there were people present in the unexpected situation of young people, the police had been driven by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
According to this witness, the relief arrived " about twenty minutes after the police march " .
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
" I will not let you assume that police services did not bring assistance to young people.
These young people have been helped.
The bombers arrived at once.
Everything has been done to try to save them," stressed the prosecutor.
The tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police repressed on Monday the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
The last of them replicated the shooting of stones, wounding the police.
At least 350 lawyers have been interrogated.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers required a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent grouping.
Other events would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (norwest).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped into the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president " urged the population to send flowers to the judges who were pronounced against the state of emergency and the losses they had sworn in front of Musharraf. "
" Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the measure of exception proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
I had to speak in the next few days about the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
" All we attend is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court cases," the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president " no longer values " after the state of emergency was established, he told the Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government has denouncing insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his Deputy Army Chief.
More than a third of pregnancy remains unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36%) is not expected, it reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuvirth Act which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as pill or sterile still present a failure rate of 5 % to 6 %, estimated Ined.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for a better " fertility domain " , according to the Institute that notes that the rate of pill use among women aged 20 to 44 is from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight births of each ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated slightly more or less per month for a couple of each five and if possible for the spring season, judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will take more than seven hours of work in space for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his teammates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a clear and indispensable solar panel for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "chapped" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released the harmony launcher, a solid cylindrical piece to quickly host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing Andean for laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a solar panel production module that weighed 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began reorganizing the solar panels of the module, which have a width of 76 meters.
And it's where one of the panels, which spread like accordions, has been damaged in a little bit more or less than a meter by a cable that touched.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
Astronauts, who had at first performed a control output from the Discovery launcher, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who's been chosen to ride at the end of the 30 meters length of the tele-directed arm of the launcher added to the station for repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space walker) in the Nasa.
High, resistant, very skilled, has the very developed torso and the long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been responsible for "operating" the solar panel "damaged".
After inspecting the damage precisely, he sectioned the fallible cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had helped him with the second "spacewalker " that had stayed close to the airlock and, from inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a hockey minibastonne wrapped with an insulator to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "chapped" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery launcher to return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title of EADS penalized in Bolsa
The EADS action is currently underway in the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion to deal with A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been obliged to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to the delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which provides the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost of palpating the delay taken in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between EUR 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", the European Building Authority's mother house announced.
Due to these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adding without any more encryption.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operational result of EADS failed 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads related to the delays of another programme, the very heavy carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The status quo selection
No surprise Sunday, at the exit of the urns: the Russians are going to choose massively for President Putin's party, united Russia.
Confirming its aspirations for stability, including authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a televised message about public chains, already registered but the content of which is kept secret.
He does this as the leader of the united Russia list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory has been shown to be devastating.
Yesterday, the President did not allow himself to be transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, happy to pay a new charge against the accused of interference - his subject of predilection during the campaign.
" We know the price of true democracy and we want more transparent and open elections, no incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He's complaining about a press campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there has never been such a dirty election until the time of Eltsin.
After the repression of the last weekend's demonstrations, the former champion of Jack Garry Kasparov's world, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet man"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two more open questions:
Who will happen to Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to get to know each other.
Election in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful Russian party united that would elect the government and the president?
Either the legislative elections or the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
" The Russians kept the mind of the Soviet man, they do not feel their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kokossov, from the state university of St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society has been delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Putin restored the model of a paternist state, perfectly accepted by the population, since this new paternism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic downturn " , she appreciates Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians " freely renounce personal responsibility " of those who had recently been tested after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of each 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, they will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: "Why reflect?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitlerian regime, are available.
The 47 million files, stored over 27 km of shelters in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not available here only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or his right-holders.
The eleven States responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to searchers and historians.
Since the ratification process for this agreement has been completed by all States, the opening process has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable search " particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers " , explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Red Cross Commission (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, have opposed the public opening of these nominations because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental Handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find deported or subjected to compulsory work and, where appropriate, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way for compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new that should be expected from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Antisemitism at the Technische Universität de Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, the Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached about EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free movement agreement in 2008, European Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath pointed out.
Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Union had given their approval to the European Commission last April to begin negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with a view to signing free trade agreements.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
" A free trade pact will cover a great deal of both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million Europeans," Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner specified. The Asian and European giants change annually for " EUR 47 billion " and for " EUR 10 billion of services", said Danielle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade " has not yet reached its potential." The European Union and India are meeting Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England was concerned on Thursday to ease the current turn of credit concerns, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75 per cent in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" In order to alleviate the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly strained at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way in which they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its provision of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, " .
The Bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 1215 GMT, the basic index and until 10 January.
It is the first time that the UK BoE has put liquids on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its Communication that " it is prepared to take other measures to maintain interbank loan indices " online with its basic index.
The interbank index per day was 5,829 per cent on Wednesday.
The three-month index was set at 6.6 per cent, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in summer, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with an important penalty rate that has deterred banks from resorting to this.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the change in the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, to the more favourable indices and with more assured discretion.
The UMP and NC parties reject the consideration of the PS party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
In a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the national PS office, including an increase of 50% of the employment surplus, the restoration of the TIPP (inland for oil products), a check-transport or rental restrictions.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the consideration of articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting has been raised at the end of the general discussion that has led to exchanges, sometimes live, between the majority and opposition to Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power for a few hours.
The leader of the PS MPs Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending financial bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes out.
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer's Melvin Benn Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, no less than, the current movement of festivals in America," entrusted Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August in a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Another time known under the name of Mean Fiddler, director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the lead at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to its portfolio, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glasstonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glasstonbury as a "more inspiring event " that he has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as the market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in central Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in low-level policies because of the current administration, pursue Charlie Jones.
" Fortunately, we could discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that will last take place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 in the Grant Park in Chicago, after being unmarked in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross incomes of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a camp festival, while ours are done in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to simultaneously give an impression of camp festival in the European and urban way in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
" The Vineland community, including the mayor, wholeheartedly supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is "very large", for example, of the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been launched to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
" Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will vary there, with the hope of attracting all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film dishes to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of the delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions " .
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he says.
The Race for Festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote film from here.
The career in the Oscars is started.
All West Coast festivals, whether from Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebecan films, value them and make sure that the performers conduct interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in the cartel in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short metres to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a rally at the end of the year in a bag? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks to fire the closing of the exercise, investors are already shaking their hands, hoping that the traditional rally will arrive at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the bag usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not supporters of the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to quality values in both long and short strands".
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a more lateral behavior, I do not exempt from volatility "particularly because it is not known the impact of the likely descent of the types of the Fed, given the high level of cruelty and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, who is responsible for BPI sales in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to say that there will be rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
Ibex has lost about 4 per cent of the maximum scored on 8 November when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
Still not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst from Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year the closest to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that are made every year on these dates.
However, the expert argues that things will be something different this year because he believes that the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not consider that volatility is going to affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banko, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a rebate of the index that could be driven depending on the news coming from the U.S. regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
Analysts agree on the time to choose the values that will be responsible for bringing Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year it touches the great values".
The expert would include in the portfolio both large banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, from Inversis Banko, ensures that the increases will come from the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers may also benefit from this rally if they give.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC to follow their own path," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be a major factor in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales during the season of Christmas sales.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although there is not much representation in the Spanish market in this case.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two times in December has been a low month.
The real rally at the end of the year was lived in 2003, the exercise in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the cutting of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, December recorded a record of 6.68%.
It will have to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profit (Ibex currently rises 8.36% since January) and if it can count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renew most of their offices.
A total of 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to jump to the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 a.m., and open Saturdays from 10 to 20.30 a.m.
Another group that has also repeated on several occasions that wanted to expand the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he is about to conclude an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays instead of opening one afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of Popular experience will be crucial for other entities to be targeted or not at this initiative according to trade schedules.
This is precisely the goal pursued by Popular with the project.
Catch the private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, self-employed people and shops of the streets selected to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
For this purpose, the entity will modernise branches already in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers from different streets.
In this way, the expansion of schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the space of the branch and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although a larger recruitment of staff, since it is likely to have about six employees locally between eight and nine.
Offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three Madrid offices.
And the experience has been positive, according to Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via de Madrid have been elected, and it seems that it is correct, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And other 60 operating under the Mondocredit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very long schedules, which even open Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax venues you will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of your offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers', says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with outside staff at the bank.
Double telecinco for the first time the value in Bag of your rival Antena 3
We've got it.
With that phrase, he expressed his satisfaction yesterday with Paolo Vasile, a telechinco delegate, at the end of the market, when he found that the chain he was leading doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
It was only one aspect that made her happy: 'it's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more, but because we've dropped less', she said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished yesterday with a 2.54% advance.
That gain puts your loss on what we carry year by year at 15.66%.
The value in the Stock Exchange of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which gave up 1.52% yesterday and accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (Fifth Days Editor) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we cost it in terms of hearing.'
Telecinco announced last week that it was planned to become the first television channel to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising income, said Giuseppe Tringali, the delegate adviser of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary of the group.
If this announced data were to become real, the television network would record this exercise an increase of 3.6% in its advertising bill for the 2006 financial year 965.4 million.
For its part, Antena 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million) while net TV revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that points analysts to the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that has remained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is ready to make the decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to leave our shareholders happy, to whom we have already given courage with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market shows at these moments of some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and by 7% in 2009.
It should be explained that the projected growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same signature has lowered Antena's profit forecast 3 to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: It recommends that both values be purchased on the basis of their high profitability for long-term dividends and potential sustainability.
2.
Box Madrid: you better see Telecinco (acumular) than Antena 3 (maintain) for the 'multiple attractive' and business height.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to integrate in both cases by having 'similar threats' (satisfied market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the Congress's vote on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to the public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and Senators to negotiate and consensualize the best regulation in the fields of ensuring the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activity of entities for the efficient functioning of markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, involves modernising financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the various European Union supervisors.
The new regulation will enable financial advisory services to be provided to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services signatures (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of financial instruments operating systems so that regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with the current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and risk management forms and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they are carrying out to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its move by the Congress Economic Commission, several amendments were incorporated, including emphasising that titled debt is considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with the US high risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that diplomats in Economics and Entrepreneurs can perform 30 years after the real decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists was adopted in 1977.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work abroad, will not require the authorisation of the CNMV and may provide its product marketing and customer capture services to various investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised IPC increases five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which is used after Eurostat to incorporate it into the European Union's inflation index calculation, provides an advance on how prices have evolved in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The above indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using several statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily correspond to the final data, which will be made known on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The Vice-President and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes have said that the rise of 4.1% of the IPC in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has hoped that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out at Congress halls that "even though the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential over monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also explained that "there was less surprise" in November than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We were expecting a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economic Affairs has acknowledged with regard to the progress made today.
Virgin plans to raise with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, he collected a record of more than 25 billion pounds, a figure that had fallen progressively in two and a half months because of the distrust of his clients and despite the guarantee of a hundred per cent of that money offered by the Government and which would remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the entity with her financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the British bank's income that is deposited in the next three years to achieve those 18 billion pounds remaining until reaching the target of 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson Magnet group, known for its successful advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin Consortium, in which three other companies participate, as his favorite to rescue him from the bankruptcy.
Arrested the mayor of Totana for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has detained today at the first hour of the morning to the current mayor of the Muslim municipality of Totana (the People's Party) for his alleged connection to the urban corruption plot this week.
In addition, one of the compositional and municipal police secretaries has also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales last May, the current popular MP, and until then the municipal director, and that according to the sources of the research consulted by the SER chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
Officials continue to record municipal units and urban advisory services and no further detentions will be released in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales, the chief suspect of the urban corruption plot, was charged at the beginning of this week.
As yesterday reported to the SER chain, the lawyer of the 'popular' MP Juan Morales, so far, he was stopped from the home of Morales with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to research sources, is the alleged charge of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signature of a urban convention with a Galega construction company to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the OSCE's candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win
The former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE list by Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced by the OSCE Secretary of the Organization, José Blanco, and the Bono itself, after the meeting held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief of Executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
He has also pointed out that "yes" the political manchigo will be the candidate of the Socialist Group to preside over Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who announced last November 15 his decision not to present himself to the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to fight climate change in the university field.
The former Minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting on his return to the political vanguard since his resignation two years ago.
He also pointed out that, as citizens know who will be the Vice-President of the economy if the OSCE wins the elections, their party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress in a "transparency act".
If you reach the position, Bono expects to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or of shouting" and make it "seems more and more to the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems sad that the only place in Madrid where one can't speak peacefully and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government on some occasion interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good to do" and has not wanted to see himself already occupying his position so as not to fall into what he has pointed out his opponents might see as "prepotence".
Climate propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subject to relentless persecution, both to the skepticism of its predictions and to those that prioritise other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron consistency.
And more a leader of the movement that is president of the Government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach obliges you to explain why the action, or inaction, of your Government has made a decisive contribution to the EU's failure to comply with Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the failure, in which sectors has occurred and why his Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires the Spanish to explain with utmost clarity what measures are to be taken to stop climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, who will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been nor will there be such explanations.
Exactly because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costs, inconveniences and threats to businesses and individuals' accounts.
Up to the hundredth of the PSOE suggested gas has seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With striking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful for electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor complains nor demands, but he adores myths and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not intend to move on a bicycle or to refresh with the abanic.
Arrested by the mayor and local police chief of Totana by a suspected plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has detained the mayor of Totana's Murcian village, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the City Council Secretary and a hosting businessman for possible urban crimes, have reported sources of research today.
The edil was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, where he is currently located alongside numerous agents, who have also visited the Urban Council and the municipal management company of the Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are added to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the revalidation of more than 2 million hectares of rural land in urbanization so that the Galega Nuaria company builds 4,000 houses after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but were charged in the summary, which instructs Judge No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees are now in court.
According to the sources, the former director of Totana and today's autonomous parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, are being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, the owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, was charged, as was the current girlfriend of the former director, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), like Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Imonauar, an agency incorporated into the group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is under the responsibility of the Central Operational Unit's Urban Crimes Unit (UCO), whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, most of them in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rosas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a very well-known poultry company in the region, which could have acted as intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the city of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "sppa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana that had been reclassified and its project would result in a duplicate of the municipality's population, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the lively parking of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando El Católica streets; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; It recommends, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent makes this comment yesterday in Finland's most important journal (by default in the head of the PISA report on education in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, on the very day when the criticism of Blackburn's book was curious:
"The content of the philosophy signature has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Yokela school.
The culprit of the deaths, a baccillerate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Council for the Assignment of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the mandatory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."

A colleague provides information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Offences on Internet Downloads:
A. Discharge of a song would be a crime worth six months a year.
On the other hand, if you steal from the store disks of less than EUR 400, you are simply considered to be missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to EUR 1,000 in the store, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than the charge (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the download (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participation in a tumultuous reign is punishable by three months per year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would be punished by six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the author ' s permission is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right, someone is going to the hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor gives me one of his rare research articles entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depend on what fellow workers earn.
The study has been conducted through tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Group of the Life&Brain Institute, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers observed that if when both received the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if it took so much science to conclude this.
The Balkans prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals since the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year, and Carla will go with a bitter taste, because the chief responsible for the Srebrenica murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic remain at large.
Its names are on that list, which takes its title from the documentary by Swiss contractor Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla List' (2006, not strained in Spain), who, at the pace of a police thriller, continues the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue fugitive criminals and pressure the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What's for sure?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in front of possible sinisters, represents an important cost that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, sheep's age, civil status, the type of vehicle to ensure or use, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialised in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being liable for the obligation to pay the compensation in the event of a fine.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors such as age, sex, sheep's age, civil status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, so that they are more likely to suffer an accident, more quota to be paid.
That is why both the greater than 25 women and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of sinestrality due to their caution.
Also, by throwing out the accounts, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of percance.
As the frequency increases, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
That's why the driver has to study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age are faced with various disadvantages when they hire insurance at an affordable price, such as the reduced driving experience and the age of the sheep.
Although the ideal to be well insured is a risk insurance, there are other more economic options.
The most careful drivers can choose for a whole risk with freeness, so that they get the cover of a insurance at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This kind of convention would assume that the client pays part of the amount of the sinter.
"The share of the amount of the customer's interest will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher as low as the amount", says Luis Noguera, the highest manager in Spain in First Europe, online insurance broker.
Another option is an extended third party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid sinisters to the extent possible, as this will affect the bonus, thereby reducing the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, criminalization is a rebate on this basic tariff.
"The benefits and penalties will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company has had a good year, the benefits may be increased," Noguera explains.
Over the past 25 years, drivers have made it easier for them to hire insurance, as the rate of sinustricity is reduced by the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended is to hire a full risk with frankness.
"You can't normally take advantage of the experience previously acquired in the time of being in an accident, and even in the time of driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the new' has passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at any risk, provided that when his economic situation allows, it is clear.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with a lower rate of sinestrality, so the charges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk free (may be EUR 300), or, where there is a high level of bonus, one at thirds extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to allow luxury to take on a greater amount of frankness," Luis Noguera said.
For pensioners it is advisable to take insurance at any risk free of charge (being EUR 150), or one to a third extended when there is a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in front of possible sinisters, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic searches for a point that is worth the eighth in Milan
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they need to achieve their respective goals in the closure of the 'Champions' league, as Italians serve to be the first and the Scottish to judge their classification.
The Italians add ten points and have already certified on the fifth day their pass with an empathy in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and receives the Benfica, who has four, does not move forward.
These two parties in Group D will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to compete with the World Clubs in Japan, where day 13 begins in semifinals in search of a place by the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the empathy at Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a victory, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would stay first and ensure a better crossing in October.
Gordon Strachan could even serve a defeat to classify himself if the Shakhtar didn't win, but can't be trusted because at nine points the pass is equal to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) on the other direct duel.
Thus, the militants will try to make the Scottishs bitter at night, who trust in getting into eighths for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round the past campaign with a Kaka goal in the extension (1-0) after 0-0.
Waiting for the victory of the 'Rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar only worth the triumph, in the event that the Celtic loses, both to get into the eighth and to continue in the UEFA.
And it is that, despite being the last and no option to follow in the European maximum competition, Benfica could achieve the third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls tour concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, before some 20,000 spectators, their first round since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before they started their concert at the GM Place Vancouver stadium that the group meeting was "bright".
About 20,000 people exhausted the inputs to attend the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that got angry at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that collects its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went out to the stage lighting up some bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the audience that covered GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had banned him days earlier.
At the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British astrologer "has not seen our dress for anything, so I'm nervous about what she's going to think of the show".
'Sporty Spice', whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the fiftieth two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"He was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the world's feeling has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the meeting of the group she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that in time, "the things have been settled and we love each other very much".
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last acted together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV TV, the group arrived at Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
At his arrival at the airport, an army of children was waiting for them.
Among the five are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California (USA), in San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5-7th).
They will act in Madrid on 23 December.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the gas price, Russia will have to pay higher traffic rates.
A previous debate last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that Ukraine should pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would charge Ukraine more, as it has committed itself to paying an additional 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it might be that Ukraine pays 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told the Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments on traffic rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine".
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which rapidly increased prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply with Turkmenistan gas and other former Soviet nations of Central Asia.
NHS "should try foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal records of employees outside Europe, one observer said.
The general auditor Robert Black's recommendation came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate understanding of the number of foreign personnel with whom he is employed.
However, his report pointed out other controls that are properly carried out through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign personnel employed outside the European Economic Area following attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep was shocked at the doors of the terminal airport building.
He was one of the three doctors who acted on the Old Bailey video conference in October, accused of alleged car bomb attacks in the United Kingdom.
NHS hopes to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The auditor-general's report recommends, inter alia, that the boards should have the guidance of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign staff."
The president of the BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential employees of NHS who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what is the added value of the recommendations made," he explained.
The Scottish health authorities declare that they currently have 1,161 foreign persons, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor-general warned that the number may be higher, partly because the boards have problems identifying which employees have unlimited residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being carried out extensively.
This includes passport controls, work permit and qualification check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing foreign pre-employment policy and guidance in the NHS.
The health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, said: "I had a great interest in this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish Government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this would be reflected in updating the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates in movie awards
Control, the biographical film about the late vocalist of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was chosen for Curtis' role, for Director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
The actress Judi Dench was named best actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal".
And Bond's protagonist, Daniel Craig, won the variety award for putting a British movie on the international stage.
The awards were given at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows the rise of Curtis's fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in white and black - which has a sound band from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3,000 pounds of sterling.
But the Dutch photographer Corbijn also won, already known for the iconic cover of the U2 Joshua Tree album, won with two prizes – the best director and the best leading director.
The rock music was the center of another award at the ceremony – like Julien Temple's film on The Clash Joe Strummer's vocalist – won the best documentary award.
The award to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a head of the Russian mob in London, in the film by David Cronenberg Promises of the East.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fiftieth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently film the sequence of Indiana Jones "The kingdom of the crystal skull".
Winston said he was proud to receive this award, so named in honor of Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, dead in 2002.
"They were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, is really an honor."
Independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The sponsors of the Bifa Festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrest 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 militants of terrorist cells planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The world's largest oil supplier state television said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the province of the East, reported the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaq, the largest oil plant in the world, following a failed attack by Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, quoting a statement by the Minister of the Saudi Interior, said that 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who has entered the country.
The minister said that the militants had planned the entry for smuggling eight projectiles to the country.
Other 22 of the detainees were planning murder of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in arresting Saudis traveling to Iraq to join as militants in Al-Qaeda to fight against the Allied forces and to support the Shiita Muslim government, which is considered heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunnies.
Al-Qaeda militants are looking at many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to seize the pro-Western government of the country - had as their foreign residence goals associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This has been a great effort by the security forces since five months ago," said the spokesperson of the minister of the interior to state television.
The arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose aim was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical dream Muslims who support violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of supporting and financial support to militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus could have once been an appropriate place for life, scientists said yesterday.
The data of a European spaceship in orbit showed to the planet the most similar to an Earth twin of what had been observed before.
Venus is the nearest planet to Earth.
Both planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made the Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the winter effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is erosion by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide a picture of how Earth could develop catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is being clarified why the climate in Venus is so different from that of Earth, when there are two similar planets.
"Our new data enables us to build a scene in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago."
Police decommissioned "rich uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare is uranium enriched, was decommissioned yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
One police spokesman said three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The officer could not confirm whether it was uranium enriched but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Still open
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy of presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow mono.
However, Republican candidates for the presidency may access a debate on YouTube, where common voters and currents record video questions and send them to broadcast among the candidates.
None of the questions presented in the afternoon of Wednesday, 28 November were more ridiculous than the one of the snow mono that asked Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican party on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party in the next year's elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show applicants to applicants.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to come up with the dial when they heard ideas they liked: the broadcasters noted approval points when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The tougher words of the night were exchanged between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial polls of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both answered aggressively when they were asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and give them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
The minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed.
No one has the word to be appointed candidate, but they both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about immigration before others.
At least in immigration, and in general, candidates share views: increased surveillance at borders, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of China's toxic toys and other external concerns, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other topics appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in Iowa's most recent survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer if Jesus was in favor, he laughed, saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is increasing in Iowa, coincidentally with the fundraising campaigns of Liberal Ron Paul, and his heated statements on Wednesday's debate.
Both have come out of the bottom, because the two winges of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both winges of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labourers' Pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant accounts of hotels in Paris, nor do they have extra-marital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has made contributions to the British Labour Government party of more than $650,000 pounds ($1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party has not denounced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister failed to call for an election, foolishly insulting British intelligence by saying that opinion polls did not influence its decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal democrat leader with growing engineering, because afraid Mr. Brown has become Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and judgmental poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative cap.
A three-thirds of retired generals initiated a motion in the Lores Chamber, protesting against the courts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a medium-term job.
Now it is the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and former colleague) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach an inflexible point after they are unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister can't improve things, which he doesn't have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials are starting to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is put on the defensive and does not focus.
In part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, it cannot defend itself by arguing that it is new.
Although I'd like to renounce Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as chancellor of the error.
And even when it is not directly involved in Blair's contracts - or "effective for partners", the investigation into the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if so.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one's dead, no one's been robbed directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compared his donations to gifts of charity, said that he did not want public recognition for his well-being.
This may be so, but the decision does not take it.
The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement and that it was not illegal, would obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising, whom he was asked about donations in October.
But Mr Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these actions, although the bulk of payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half the work.
It has been quick to condemn your party for violating the law, but it is diluted in the decision-making process by a family matter, a committee of inquiry into the matter - conducted, to a good extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as find a permanent and independent head of the Public Life Standards Commission, since he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for a genuine reform of party funding.
This will require a hard cooperative work of the workers with the Tories, and perhaps a resignation to the special financial situation of trade unions - bitter measures for a partyist such as Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he is two years old to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with an impeccable probability and strong competition.
Tiburone cards
Is the mortgage crisis undermining the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that dorsal fins swim around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes placed on the market in the country of credit cards.
Analysts in Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the mortgage crisis suppresses other forms of consumer credit.
Contagion signs are already seen.
There is an increase in both card fees and criminality rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken over 1.4 million in its financing business to the American consumer, partly because of the weakness of card lenders.
However, it is very early for panic.
Morosity and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter the 3.89% crime rate was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. Human Breakdown Act (2005) led to a sudden decline in the breakup requests, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of requests (and therefore of morosity) would be growing again, or it could happen that the conditions for the lenders were worsening.
Industry also reports sound payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed values is quite firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of crisis infection between mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debt to credit cards now that credit institutions are expired.
But the issuers of the credit card look more at the flow of liquidity than the active values, so that the falling prices do not necessarily change the creditor's accruing capacity.
They can even work to benefit the broadcasters.
Incentives for consumers to continue depreciating the mortgage will decrease if the properties are less than the loan value; and as a result, the card debt payment goes up to the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or changing creditors' balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a fast asset retreading.
"We're not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Head of Finance of Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection on the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a contraction of credit pushes America into recession, the industry is undoubtedly facing a tougher future.
You have to keep watching those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron
Three British bankers who were held accountable for fraud with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven charges of fraud for dealing with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. District, each was convicted of fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC in the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted for two years.
In the United States, its case marks the final fleet of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have warned Fastow in 2002 that it was the objective of a government investigation into Enron's fall.
The charge against the bankers - he doubled the "NatWest Tres" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former superior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a company of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the craftsman of a thousand frauds in Enron, who helped his spiral fall into failure.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary in zero, but the three British knew it would value up.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the charge, Fastow wrongly represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its part of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in Enron’s collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is executing a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year sentence and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers had to pay $1 million required to live in the United States while the trial was under way.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies in the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of fraud in accounting, could not hide the debt of millions or make it seem successful in its failed business.
The collapse led to the loss of thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former executive chief, Jeffrey Schilling, were charged with reos last year for his role in the collapse of the company.
Schilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a G550 Golfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the Russian rich.
"He has up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it's for family private flights or presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionary Fair, a four-day-consuming organ held in a center of events near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their display stands, hoping to attract the new Russians lined with all kinds of products, from caoba crafted yachts to diamond-car pairs, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully looks at a bright orange Porsche in the nearby stand."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and calderilla compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Supplied with fuel by the oil increase, the Russian capital seems to be Dallas when it was in storage.
"We lived the same in 1890, when some academia came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialistic," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"As the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and consumers."
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their part of the cake.
Another place in Moscow, a conference will be held this week on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas about how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by New York Times)
Russia has 53 billion dollars that make a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 million Russians whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local thank you.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the level of subsistence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London Jewellery.
She attended the fair for the first time next to the Russian distributor of the brand, the group Soho Jewelry.
"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the holiday on Sunday night, dressed in the afternoon, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," Yumatova said, who reeled off the design that he used as a network of vet carpets dissing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a store that mixes brands from Cadillac Scales, platinum shorts, Mövenpick ice creams, charge pool tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears in Gund.
The general public can buy 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically in a stand of Dutch real porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-size reconstruction of a painting by Rembrandt, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in "bling-bling".
In fact, the sellers said that the rich Russians of the most trajectory (10-15 years for Russian standards) had changed their tastes from belligerent logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exposed in a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, millionaires' or tourists' emissaries, fill the halls every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the festival last Thursday, Roman Ersov, chief bed manager of King Koil, said he sold two $20,000 cot systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton lined with gold yarns.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equipped high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the brilliant orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said that he had sold three car pairs in chain bracelet, for Rolls Royce Phantom, in $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with coloured Swarovski crystals embedded in it, so it would look like a roller wheel.
Cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants avestruz leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of your Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "Russian billionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the flow of real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a millionaire, at least in the paper if it's not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Non-millionaires could at least pretend to be rich with the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red phone booths (british style) filled with $1 million false billets.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing officer, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to pick up money piles, asking their friends to take photos with their mobiles while resting on monies, or getting a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
Surgery "capuza" could be the cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant window "A little healthier" and saw how an ambulance went up through White Cape Code, two doors below the West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the ambulance come up," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That was when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41 years of age, a assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
The researchers are now trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the house of 212 of Av. West Scott.
The authorities do not yet determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but they wait for the toxicological test, although the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help resolve the mysterious death that has barely reached the top ranks of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been a helper to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenaz," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, and left two children aged 14 and 11, and a daughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the County Union Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 P.M.
On 21 November, they met Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
It's been over a week and the authorities have said little about your research or the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh could not say if Mrs Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as medical advice.
On Wednesday, no one answered to the door at Mrs. Castro's house, where a marched rosemary is located on the front of the house, and a dalmat thief on the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainillina ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was found at the door of the tank, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its political culture.
"She would say, 'You have to watch this one," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It's boring."
Federal reserve is expected to cut fees to raise the Stock Exchange
The actions jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm down credit conditions at interest rates, which increased with the reassuring remarks of the US Central Bank Vice-President.
The stock exchanges took place in London, New York, and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two by Ben Bernanke, President of the Reserve, declared that policymakers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm the markets through growing samples of credit bags, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence was "in part reversed by market improvement at the end of September and during October".
If the upward trend continued, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets and to make subsequent cuts of the type of interest, to stabilize the credit conditions.
The comments also helped calm Wall Street in the midst of bad news for the US economy, such as the house sales that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a notice by Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total labour force, in an overall cost reduction to compensate for the losses of its investments in US sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average went up by 331 points, or 2.55%, to the close of 13,289.40, while the S&P 500 average went up by 2,65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index raised 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds of sterling to the value of Britain's first-order companies.
The Dax index in Germany rose by 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Previously, the re-appearance of credit tension in the markets after a strong demand for a three-month tender of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to the European commercial banks to be 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow up on the federal reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the value markets in London, strained the credit and loan rates at three months' "Libor" between the British banks, meant the largest rise since September, by 6.59%, after a constant rise since 12 November.
England takes into consideration the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as hard as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no one is less important than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan- with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moore, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because Hugh Morris, the director of England, is starting to fill out offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a part of time.
He who does not get the sixth place of battle will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes because of lack of luck more than because of capacity.
Not only in the cricket the choice is difficult, as judgements are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it just time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another way if, says John Edwards or "Tube" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, had been promoted to the table: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what a good level for a cricket player unless they give him the chance to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures of course have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to capture the captain's eye while taking a "wicket" and a drummer to get opportunities to change the order if you want to have an impact as a player someday.
But grasping the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved the past season, for example, James Anderson, who probably plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself to "fit and bowls" as the wind on the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each one to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high times and can expect more of them.
Shah or Bopara games at Asgiiya stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did it well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish at the same time who came to become an important player, and despite noting a hundred doubles against Australia in Australia, it may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moore, after another discussion at today's session at the Asgirya stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah's greatest experience on the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable proof of the 88th Bombay beginnings, 32 hundredths of the first class in front of only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven younger years, and has excellent precedents against spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten races in his two May rounds against West Indians in the trial in Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the voters when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, it seemed to have taken his "batting" something from them than in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team is happy to live in swords.
He was arrested for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he threw his vehicle at an exhibition for the English car sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, supposedly, a shock, but the first thing he did was to take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at the distance, to say with excitement: "Did you see that?".
Bopar is the best player, it is including your rebalancing pass to have effects on your games that seem to satisfy it, as it battles with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as the tea leaves suggest, is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, evicting the exiles who had been inactive, no visa extensions, and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official convoy of the government consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and which is safe now."
"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentary stop.
Qasim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in his country.
His Shiite neighbours in Amariyah called him by phone to tell him that an allied force from the United States helped to get Al-Qaeda out of his fortress west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the recent arrivals of Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been driven from his home in Sleikh to the north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after urging citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started a militia against Al-Qaeda in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my companions."
"That's why I'm back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since US troops joined groups of "anxious citizens", armed and working in cooperation with US soldiers to defend their neighbours.
But many said that they had returned for the refusal of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had been established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three children, gave a voice to the common suspicion among the exiles, who Nouri al-Maliki, the first Chinese minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe that they have fled the country because of the sectarian squares of death.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunites have been expelled from the Shiite and vice versa by relaxing tension.
There is the fear that a sudden wave of refugees will bring up the sectarian tensions again and begin the struggle.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians lack only an educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the 15th time to a non-Sarlandan non-French man who we are not French" -- that was the ironic bike on itself from the smallest federal state for his fiftieth birthday.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a great role in the education system of Sarre, which in a study of the Institute of the German Economy (IW) called "Billdungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
In this way, higher schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was merged in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, of 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a poolerate.
"In Sarre the vocational education system is being used," says Axel Plünnecke, the expert in the education sector at the Institute of the German Economy (IW).
More than five young people do their bachelor's degree in the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that Sarre is 7 points per cent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double careers, in relation to population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has dropped one third in recent years.
That was why the Ministry of Education of Sarre forced higher schools to make more advertising for the specialties in Engineering Sciences.
"After the first PISA study, we made some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparative evidence across the country.
For children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
Comparison with the next studies will show whether students have increased performance.
According to the PISA report of 2003, the number of students delayed in school development decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
But in general, Sarre did not improve much as other federal states.
In Bavaria, students can calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field good results could be achieved.
Although the Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbours is a mandatory assignment at the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chavez changes the time.
Nearly in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez left the schedule in the South American country to change by delaying the half-hour watch.
Chávez is currently staying as a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official Bulletin of the Venezuelan State, under the new law, the time will be at least four hours.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justified his decision by saying that the United States would impose the obligation on the world in its day when it changed a full time.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the break-up of relations with his neighbor Colombia due to action with hostages.
The nationalist on the left said he would not maintain any relationship with the head of state or with the Colombian government until the Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is pushing for constitutional reform where citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power could be considerably extended in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe to withdraw the Chavez mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was about the release of hostages.
On Sunday, Chávez said criticizing the decision that Uribe made has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is much talk about Chávez.
A new tone of call causes a feeling in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This sentence was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuous interruptions by the left populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the reduction in real wages threatens Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong climate.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should count in 2007 with a real salary lower than the previous year.
"The fault of this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the strain of food and energy prices," reported the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Cycle Research.
The new burdens of unemployment insurance can also be borne by employees.
Minister of Finance Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% in one year is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the office does not have to go back into an unpleasant situation, demanding credits and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a German social-democratic party politician.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most planet like Earth, something that had not yet been raised. The European Venus Express probe discovered rays in the atmosphere and remolines in the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter on Earth.
For three decades the researchers suspected that there might be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays are silent at a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal Nature.
According to the famous model of Urey-Miller's origin, the rays caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, had given rise to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it's not like this: if there were any days of life there, it would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than on Earth and on the surface at 500°C, so that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Possible, Venus is a "diabolic" twin of Earth, but still a twin," said Russell.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so much like Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there have been no special missions, just for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to researchers' opinion, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighbouring planets have more common characteristics with the Earth than we had assumed," ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers also discovered in the southern polar region a vertices formed by the fastest-turning clouds.
This phenomenon recalls the winds in the high atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost as large.
This planet is also called a white star or a vespertin star orbiting around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus is equivalent to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus, with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars, does not look much like the Earth, scientists assume that both planets had been formed under the same conditions.
On both planets there was abundant water that remained on the Earth in the oceans, but in Venus it was separated into the universe.
While carbon dioxide had become carbon stones in the Earth, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's meth with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama at the Federal Office.
He indirectly criticised the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after midnight in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, was concerned about the reputation of Germany and therefore demanded that the great coalition end this fight for the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not introduce ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt."
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy, he stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach he received in implementing a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance of the traditional course of China's policy.
China also knows," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democrat Party), had indirectly shown his disgust at the reception of Dalai Lama and was attacked by members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticised the Union for its non-operational foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama at the Federal Office caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democrat Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources from the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the ministries of Foreign Affairs in both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of the Chinese Government, demanded the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize this reception from Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Defining China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians would receive the religious leader of Tibetans in their official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama showed that they were trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances such as those in France.
Battles with the police in the streets, shootings, car burns: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that disturbances will occur as was the case with France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from moving to the streets.
They were barricaded, vandals fired guns at the police: after serious youth-renounced disturbances in France, Federal Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We must make sure that our country's social problems do not take the violent form."
"That's what we have to take seriously," said New Press, published in Hanover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change in social reality.
The Federal State, the federal state and the municipalities are already working with emphasis on solving these problems, Schaeuble said.
This refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already giving its first fruit."
It is still early to give the end of the alarm.
At the same time, Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as they do in France.
The young people staged serious street riots with the police in northern Paris last night.
In Tolouse cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, President of the Turkish Community in Germany, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government to integrate.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, warns of a simulated effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 years of age is above the average.
There is a need to make sure that there are more vocational training posts.
Kolat underlines: "We have to give a perspective to young people."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", more than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat says: "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
"You should give young people the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training faster."
While the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen took part in the action, a light helicopter flew over the territory.
The authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as trash and burned cars.
Since the previous day, a team of almost 1,000 police officers has been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Interior, announced that the police are going to take rigorous measures until necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday about 80 policemen were injured by disturbances in Villiers-le-Bel.
The disturbances continued the following night in Tolouse.
The disorder began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecutor, the death of young people was not the result of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The action far away from the reality of the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition on content has reached its last point and that there is nothing more to expect of it.
But what country does the Chancellor really live in?
After her desperate act, indifferent and unconcerned in the general debate of the Lower House, it must be said that she does not live in the country that would have to be ruled by her.
With regard to the reproach he was subjected to for having repeatedly engaged in foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it with a supposed phrase.
He said that it would be a provincial way and thus showed that he did not want to understand what was in the interest of critics.
In the Lower Chamber it was made very clear to all that this accusation was appropriate.
There could be no minimum interest or any kind of feeling about the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke was presented in this way: a very high policy that runs in foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: it was very much praised for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but it does not say anything about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising itself - for two years the leader of the Party of the Christian Union has not been able to allow such modesty.
Well, he insists on expressions so that people can get a boost.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke internal problems are appearances of little value.
The poverty of children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
The only thing that is dedicated is to talk about this subject through subordinate prayers.
It is impressive how many times it is wrong to speak when it comes to supplementing children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a better sentence.
He began to stumble "as if he had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
The section's attacking.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, faced a heated debate on the Republican presidential precedents of YouTube and now they should fear only one candidate from the outside.
The tensions between the candidates have been noted from the outset.
Mitt Romney accused his opponent Rudy Giuliani of becoming "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants" in New York.
He, for his part, replied with serious insults: "I would say that his own house was a "port" for illegal people." Giuliani answers the former governor of Massachusetts saying he was who used illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as the group of Republicans so far has no clear preference, the eight presidential precedents take advantage of the debate in the CNN, especially in order to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, surrounded by Internet users who were sent to Youtube, do not have much content either.
"With this way of isolation we let Hitler reach power," that was John McCain's reproach to his opponent Ron Paul, the only meeting he insisted on immediately withdrawing Iraq's troops.
Romney also receives many criticisms from war veterans in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding", an interrogation method, by letting a person drown in simulate his death.
Public reactions in the St. Petersburg Chamber in Florida show that while the most important topics of the campaign are others, not only the war in Iraq or the debate on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and refused to raise taxes.
This makes it possible to see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong at that time," Romney explains.He apologizes to people and the TV audience for having been the advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf ruled without uniform.
One day after his resignation as Army Chief, the Pakistani President was sworn as President.
That's how the eight years of military government end in Pakistan.
Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his military commander's mandate to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially by the United States.
Eight years after he was given power with an incredulous military coup, the former general for the first time ruled the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation to the Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf met the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayum, the state's general prosecutor, after the Musharraf oath, will soon cancel the state of emergency and meet the second condition of the west.
Since the announcement of an exception in the Supreme Court there have been many supporters of Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all the resources before the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a convoy of soldiers in the North Watersistan region, five soldiers died and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesman's information, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s continued its activities: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a reestreno a copy of "Live 1974" was made which was written at the best time of the band.
By then they were very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to an official food caused the feeling.
Each of them has its box, its cables and especially its buttons in front of him.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Everyone contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for the Krautrock fans was the fact that the Harmonia band would make music again.
What you have to rebel here is this: the exact questions have shown that the band's name reappeared in people's minds, but it wasn't as special as so that after 32 years the audience would be so surprised.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the wrong Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a "Echo" music award to the members of the Can 2003 Colonia band for their life work, the room could see the surprised faces of the German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chile Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouth with wonder.
Later Michael Rother spent time on the stage during the concerts of Red Hot Chile Peppers as if he had been an old friend (on the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and at that time I did not have a great effect on the public, however, it was later obtained thanks to the others.
Some time ago Moebius and Roedelius had performed music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a very famous one.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Roth had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the Neu band! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that was too radical at the time.
In 1973, Roth followed Cluster's musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th - century ruin, they lived as refugees of the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was rather an artist's life full of surprises.
According to one day, an association flag appeared on Ottenstein's harmony in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Music von Harmony" and the second "De Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just to get to know themselves.
The "Live 1974" CD was recorded during a concert in Griesem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to drive Harmony and do it from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Roger ended up on esoteric issues and secured his existence with albums like "Flaminge Herzen".
Cluster survived the 1980s and has had more success since then than Harmony had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that is to thank Groenemeyer.
Your Greenland music company was set as a goal to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band Neu! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures at the Festival Wordtronics.
There is Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a superband, a seat that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to her in the future".
There are photos where Harmony appears with producers in a farm.
The history of the development of legend is shown in the projections of photos in black and white, where instruments are seen with cables.
There are three veterans in the background who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and battery in order to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects apparatus that they had built with their own hands.
Now electronic music is just as it had to be.
Three people who dig deeper into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Bárbara Morgenstern, in a musical setting he is touched, he whispers and at a good moment of emphasis he sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always an English term.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in the music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or running away from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
He who calls here "68!" is also right, but now Harmony keeps calm.
On the stage we think very well about what is already obvious.
Where does it start and where does the music end?
That can break one's nerves or give you quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only needs more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are once again dedicated to war in the Balkans.
But they didn't have much conviction.
Either the concepts are very focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, continue hiding on the Balkan mountain, but right there, in the dark interior of the country during the war in Bosnia, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant roles and little importance in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do the movie titles have to be so long and shot today?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the background, its role as a reporter in war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and industry of the film had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life had already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decade kept most of his charm so far.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, together with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, it turns out to be only a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be described in a few words: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acting very quickly and that also leads to her being loved by her.
The meaning of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we celebrate that Serbs are not presented again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
The example of "The Hunting Party" can be investigated, because there has never really been a good movie about war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and with another script author (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story about US war reporters who are going to detect a criminal war Serb called "Zorro" could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
So, stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and always turns out to be a crazy trip.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first they introduce us to Simon Hunt, to whom they don't just let him be a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also provides a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnian who will kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters at an impressive speed achieve what they couldn't achieve for five years by NATO, the CIA and all the world's headhunters, who were to capture the war criminal and leave them to the Bosnian Muslims to avenge themselves in a just way.
It is so bad that they are eager to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply humane.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadzić and Mladić are still free, and points out that Americans and French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to his head a very famous poem from Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great thorns of his face I see, sharing the feelings with him, which is hard to be evil."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they prove that it is hard to be good.
The problem is not only the kind of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good movie about South Africa.
It's almost always worth a rule: when a star merges into a crisis region or mine fields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all the borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Likely all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood makes a good film on the burnt offering, for example, the movie "The Schindler List".
Some films need more time. Classics like the works on the Vietnam War "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times were not celebrated unanimously as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about global conflicts, and that is why in our time every murder (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because the script authors don't have the least repair (which is necessary for power) to tell good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Great dictator" turned out to be so good at the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know that it was really so bad the Nazi regime.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to film.
Perhaps it must be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look from an artist.
When asked about parallelisms between his historic novel "Lemprière Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied, "It's only because some things never change."
The great cities will always be in danger, the men will always be brutally murdered and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives negative criticism of the Olympic Games in response.
The mayor of Hamburg received many political and economic criticisms not to apply for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue to fight for the competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic when you love the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director General of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, expressed this resignation on Wednesday as "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, political momentum could not be maintained, sporty at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which relates to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust kept his statement that Hamburg's ambitions in the organization of the Summer Olympic Games would not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports decides," von Beust says at the WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich's application for the Winter Olympic Games of 2028.
"This preference means to us that in this period of time, which we had so far thought to have up to 2028, from a realistic point of view, we will have no opportunity."
Nevertheless, this dream did not end forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It is too soon to leave the opportunity, if the plans are ruined at this moment," said HSB Director Günter Plöß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is contradictory to the statement of the Senate chief who made at a reception on the basis of the general meeting of the German Public Sport Federation of higher schools (adh).
There von Beust named Hamburg's application for universities in 2015 not as "a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Sports Federation of Higher Schools named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) has reproached the Senate for not taking so much time to build houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate was lagging behind the development of the small grassbrook district, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the building of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, members of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required integrated Olympia planning for the small Grassbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's application for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever connects the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on the list of works of Warhol.
Most of the ninety-four "type" Lights box on this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes in 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Modern Museum of Stockholm conducted internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén Museum gave to the Modern Museum, they are false, and almost a hundred others of the "type Stockholm" who are in circulation in the international art market are also found.
The prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the red, blue and white wooden boxes, with the same sample that they had "Brillo" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his works in 1968 at the Modern Museum, hundreds of cardboard boxes were exposed. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
It was not art works, but examples (which were only a few objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed for production in Sweden of wooden glasses, but they were not shown at the Modern Museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered into the history of art and auctions as the originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "type Stockholm" authorized by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were purchased in auctions for over $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén Museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already died three years ago.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservators of the Moderna Museum, investigated six Bright-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and embellished their pressed plates and then painted them to the oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a roll without printing directly the pressed plates. Furthermore, it is not the oil painting, but the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brillo-Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Modern Museum and adds that if the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Commission in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Modern Museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exhibitors."
Already in July the Authentication Commission formally announced that it would accept these "serious accusations" concerning soap powder boxes.
But from that moment on, everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender to Manila.
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers who had landed in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Head Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
The faithful soldiers to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been dragged into the building a few hours ago.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had a trial Thursday for trying a coup d'état in 2003 that ended with a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, in order to be able to deposit with about 30 sympathizers.
Apparently, the military police who were supposed to monitor him had passed on to their ranks and followed their motive.
They entered the hotel "Península" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The government's troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Councillor, condemned the conduct of the soldiers.
"People are tired," said Trillanes.
"We call people to get to our rows."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously led the squad of elite Scout Reangers, said that within a short time the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The major government critics called on Thursday for a big protest against the president.
For months his government has been blamed for corruption.
In 2003, the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all attention to the motive it was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts at coup d'état against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be Versatel's largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the Versatel telecommunications company.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price for an action is EUR 14,46.
It has only 20.05 percent of the social capital.
There were many speculations about the company's absorption.
There are also options to increase the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market (Digital Subscription Line).
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entry into business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its participation in the network operator of Duesseldorf by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market, this means that the financial institution retains the title of participation for a third party.
United Internet already on the previous day involved almost 10 percent of the Drillisch telecommunications company.
Drillisch placed 17.4 million of the new shares worth EUR 106.4 million in the capital increase measure.
United Internet has purchased from them 5.15 million shares for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, the companies started negotiations on trade cooperation in DSL products.
"Let's strengthen our collaboration," United Internet spokesperson explained.
The two companies founded an SME joint venture to acquire the Freenet competitor.
Thursday United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with ten percent of Freenet participation and do not use their right, i.e., to participate 18.49 percent of Freenet.
This meant that both companies maintained all options, especially participation in the anonymous Freenet society.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.25 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the holding of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 per cent of the participation in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 per cent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
