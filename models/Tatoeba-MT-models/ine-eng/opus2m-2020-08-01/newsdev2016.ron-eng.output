Former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet brought before the court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet for its alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme on the Petrobras state oil company.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office said Jose Dirceu will be sent to the court for corruption, fraud and money laundering charges brought this month.
Other 12 persons will be judged, including Joao Vaccari Neto, the former Treasury of the Employers' Party, located in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, the former president of Petrobras' services.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the Employers' Party in the government in custody of the links to this scheme.
Dirceu served as head of cabinet of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August from home, where he was already under arrest at home, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a voting purchase scheme in Congress more than 10 years ago.
The prosecutors said that Dirceu developed a bribe-taking scheme at Petrobras, accepted bribes while it was in operation and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the scandal of the votes purchased.
According to the prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved approximately $2 billion in bribery and other illegal funds.
Some of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and their allies.
It would also include bribery to Petrobras directors in exchange for covered contracts.
"Miracle recovery" of a student survivors of the Peshawar massacre
A paralyzed teenager after being shot four times in the most complete terrorist attack in Pakistan succeeded in a "miraculous" recovery after receiving treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohammed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years old, the doctors in Pakistan told him that he would never be able to go again.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the public school of the Peshawar army last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be removed later from the hospital.
Just nine months ago, on a usual Tuesday morning, Mohamed stood at the first aid hour and listened carefully to his teachers.
Right then, seven armed men dressed in uniforms of security agents entering the army's public school.
They carried hundreds of explosives and had to carry out a simple mission: to kill all the men, women and children who were on their way.
"I can't forget what happened that day," Mohamed says with a sharp look.
I was sitting in the amphitheater, asking questions... and then I heard gunshots outside.
The terrorists came in and they started killing.
Mohamed describes how he pulled four students out of the amphitheater while the carnage was taking place.
Then he says he heard his friend call Hamza.
He said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I held him by the hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he was in the head.
Most of those killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohammed's arms.
Mohamed recalls that immediately after that he lay down and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the bridge down.
The Peshawar doctors in northern Pakistan, then Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to go.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul coming out," says Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
Those nine months were the hardest of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son would never use his legs again.
They made a campaign and asked for help from Pakistani television, attracting the support of famous people such as Imran Khan, a political cricket player.
In the end, they managed to raise funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and provide treatment to the private Harley Street in London.
Consultant neurosurgeon Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "feared" when he arrived at the hospital.
“They spent the last [some] months sleeping in bed, without being able to move from one side to the other,” Malik says.
He was weak. He put a lot of pressure on his back.
She wasn't in a very good shape.
A truth from the backbone of Mohammed's spine was destroyed
Mohamed had been shot in the shoulder, shoulder and back during the attack, and his lower spine had been destroyed, leading to paralysis.
During a six-hour operation, however, Malik and his team were able to re-read the nerve endings and rebuild the destroyed part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised by what happened next.
Just a week after the operation, Mohamed got up and started taking steps and going.
We didn't expect such a good result.
It was a miracle," he says.
In less than two weeks of operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged fate and began to go again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But it is determined to return to Pakistan, join the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel I still have a chance to live," he says, showing the images with weapons drawn by him along with school manuals and styles
Physically, Mohamed gets stronger every day, but the psychological trauma he's going through and now is unimaginable.
"My anger has not fallen," he confesses.
In my school, little children were killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother wipes out a tear, eats it up and says, "I see my son walking again."
He'll be able to continue his life.
The 4G "Super Voice" service at Three offers a better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a lower frequency, which can cover a wider area
Mobile phone provider Three has launched a service in the United Kingdom that says it will improve reception within buildings and rural areas without signal.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a spectrum with a lower frequency.
And other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VolTE)".
This only works with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the coming months.
Three points out that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to service by 2017.
Head of Technology, Bryn Jones said: “By the end of the year, one million of our clients will have access to better indoor coverage and will be able to use their phones in more places than they have ever been".
The sights are prepared for the pantomime stagnation
Pantomime traineeship is very important for theatres throughout the United Kingdom, many of them preparing for the traineeship this year.
Now, at the Christmas Theatre, some of the biggest names in the show business take part.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in Cenuaressa - the first in the role of one of the bad sisters, and the second in the role of the frog.
They reveal the secrets of their pantomime at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: "If I don't do anything, I feel guilty"
Steven Wilson was recently appointed as the major winner of the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson was often called the most musical worker in the progressive rock world.
The musical talent won three awards at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the award for the best album of the year for Hand.
In his five-star review, The Guardian called the album "a clever, expressive and captivating work of art".
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine of several music projects, the most famous of them being the Porcupine Tree rock band.
Now, before two shows with the house closed at the Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launches a double LP only in vinyl format, Transience, to show the "more accessible" side of his solo activity.
He told the BBC about his love for vinyls and his programme loaded and explained how comedy actor Matt Berry got to open his shows.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up right at the end of the vinyl era, and I remember that I was just waiting for the CD to appear, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You bought a disk, you went home with him, you had a scratch and you had to bring him back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, for example classical, they're better than vinyls.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing else that you really appreciate.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice picture attached to the supply.
It's something you can hold in your hand, while you're being absorbed by verses and wrapped up by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it doesn't seem like it if some kids too young to remember their vinyls like this kind of experience.
Do you have any vinyl you especially have?
I admit I got rid of all the vinyls in the '90s.
All the vinyls we bought again.
I started off with the idea of restoring the collection that I was 15 years old, but I crossed that limit.
The first disc I convinced my parents to buy from me was Out of the Blue from the Electric Light Orchestra.
If I had still had the original copy, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately it's somewhere in a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes that the album will be a gateway to possible new fans
Why did you launch your new vinyl transition compilation?
This was originally conceived as an idea for the Day of Speech Stores, but I missed the opportunity.
My speech house suggested that I gather some of my shortest and most accessible melodies.
I've come to be easily obsessed with the idea of making some kind of "introduction into Steven Wilson's music" and I kept the project unattainable that it was only launched on vinyl.
Who buys the vinyl also receives a variant downloaded to a high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in real light?
No, because, although I focus on longer musical plays, there's something I've always appreciated more than anything: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses on the technical complexity rather than the melodic width.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, passed the time test because they always put emphasis on the melodic side and the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for Albert Hall's shows?
I don't want you to reveal too much.
The inventory will be completely different every night.
First, there's gonna be a version of the show Hand.
The second night will be a better incursion into my history, it will be more oriented towards the fans who have been following me for years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show on the second night?
And me and the others on the tour team are big fans of the [channel 4 comedy series] toast of London, to the point that we give it all the time.
I thought I'd listen to Matt's music, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
I talked to him about our shared love for Mike Oldfield and I asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
I think I'm extremely lucky to have him in the open.
You have left albums of such troops as XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does that affect your own music?
I'm not consciously inspired by this, but it's inevitable that when you rebuild these classic albums, they stay in your mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was undoubtedly the most progressive old school album I've ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I was remissing King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all the previous year.
The current album, Hand. Was., is much more open, because I was working at Tears for Fears and XTC.
You are often described as the most busy progressive rock musician.
Is that how you feel?
You can delete the progressive word.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in today's music world and I'm not saying that with pride, because, please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an ethics of incredible strength work.
If I don't do anything all day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why working on remixes was a gift, because it means I don't have to do my music all the time.
The music industry is a hard place to make a career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work every day and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I were lazy I don't think I'd survive.
The transition will be launched in the United Kingdom on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will play at the Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his European tournament 2015-2016.
A new contract brings jobs back to Skytrans
New Skytrans re-engaged part of the airline's personnel who lost their job when the old Skytrans went bankrupt.
Skytrans, a company that was redeployed from northern Queensland, has awarded it a $25 million contract to transport employees of the natural gas company QGC, which meant that 18 crew members had regained their job.
Skytrans, a company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidized routes that constituted a large part of the airline's business.
The fall has led several communities to face an isolated potential, and Warren Entsch, the national-liberal federal parliament for northern Queensland, was the representative voice of criticism of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, relaunched the Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thine, executive director of Skytrans, said the airline's contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We have managed to re-engage 18 Skytrans staff members as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff, with direct logistics experience in managing flight operations for QGC clients.
In just five months, we got 100% of our workforce, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract aims to extend Skytrans's flight operations from its headquarters in Cairns, which serves Cape York and the Torres River, and to include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 return flights per week for QGC personnel and for entrepreneurs in Brisbane to locations in Chinchilla and Taroom, on its Dash-8 flights from 36 places, starting Monday, October 26.
Tony Nunan, QGC Executive Director, said Skytrans received the contract following an invitation to tender.
"We are pleased that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a company in Queensland," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains its high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal Parliamentarian and Fresh Mother Kelly O'Dwyer receives the advice to make a bigger reserve of milk in order to avoid losing the vote in the Chamber
It looks like there'll be more women in the office
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be invested on Monday and there are strong signs that more women will take care of the portfolio.
One of the sights on the government's rise, Kelly O'Dwyer, has received the advice to make a bigger reserve of milk for her newborn to avoid breast-feeding in her parliamentary duties.
The advice comes from the government's disciplined officer, Scott Buchholz, who later consulted his laboratory counterpart to find out what is the most appropriate approach for a parliamentary who is nursing, according to the current orders.
Liberal Parliamentarian Kelly O'Dwyer and her daughter Olivia.
In accordance with the orders in force - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - the mothers who breast-feed obtain a vote power in Parliament.
This means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip didn't know about this exemption until he consulted the opposition officer, Chris Hayes, on this issue.
Things were rushed on two occasions, when O'Dwyer was unable to attend a division meeting and could not fulfill his obligation to give a speech because he had just begun breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if the parliamentary thought of making a bigger milk reserve instead of breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, Parliamentarian of Queensland, is responsible for the government's discipline.
Later, the two resolved their dispute.
Both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources from Buchholz and O'Dwyer said to Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins division was angry when she was told to make a bigger milk reserve instead of breast-feeding her daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This fact is revealed even when new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is working on setting up his new cabinet.
Buchholz, the liberal national parliament of Queensland, was promoted under the responsibility of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the attempt to attempt censorship in February of this year.
O'Dwyer, in the picture with Amanda Rishworth of the Labour Party and her son, Percy, is one of the three mammies in Parliament.
The former disciplinary officer, Phillip Ruddock, was removed only a few days after Abbott faced a censorship motion by which he wanted to be removed from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, a Tasmanian liberal, was also promoted and appointed responsible for accompanying discipline.
Nickolic had recently held the first page of the papers, after it was discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message asking him to give up contesting Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after her daughter, Olivia, was born in May.
It is one of the three parliaments that have become mammoths this year.
The spokesperson for the Labour Party, Catherine King, said on Wednesday that the voting power for nursing mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
"She's [seven] now," she wrote on Twitter.
The disciplined person should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said on Wednesday that he wants more women in his cabinet.
"No one wants to see more women in power, influence, in Parliament, in the ministry, throughout the country," the prime minister told reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included a single woman in his first cabinet and, after pressure to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after the resignation in December.
Five things the business environment wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will the markets react?
Mal Maiden, an editor at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull might have on Australia's business sector.
Tuesday, business lobbying groups did not know how to manifest their enthusiasm more strongly when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's flagship as prime minister.
The main reason is that much of what many of them would have wanted to see had been abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or simply arrived in a suspended negotiated because of Abbott's "crash-or-crash-through" political style.
Representatives of interest groups spoke at the union about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy public interest, reach a political agreement and do things well.
So what exactly do the largest companies in the country and their representatives expect from our new prime minister?
CHAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to exceed negative advertising.
Turnbull itself set the objective of the free trade agreement with China.
In his first speech in which he announced on average that challenge, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (CHAFTA) represented the central point of his attack on Labourer Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticised the "responsive outbreaks of economic forestry" by the Labour Party regarding the problem and expressed concern about the racist attempts of critics.
"In the context of ChaFTA, the winners are, numerically, much more than losers," he said in the same speech.
The business environment expects him to win this debate.
Don Argus, the legendary businessman of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and by James Packer, the billionaire in the gaming industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this agreement, and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to exceed negative advertising and negotiate with the whole Senate.
Small Enterprise Minister Bruce Billson supports the recommendations of the Harper Analysis.
This could lead from the beginning to some differences in the business environment.
The impact assessment shall apply in the case of large mergers and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer because of the lack of competition.
It is called "effect assessment" because it takes into account not only the actions and intentions of the company but also the effect they will have on competition and the market.
The way this assessment is drawn up is extremely important for the outcome.
The Harper analysis of competition law recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large companies to take smaller operators off the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the side of the Australian Business Council and the major retail traders.
Turnbull now makes it clear he wants the entire cabinet to think about what he'll do next.
CAA jumped up to say that if Turnbull follows the recommendations of Harper's analysis, consumers will need to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one that advised the new prime minister to have greater respect for the cabinet processes, which Turnbull seems to do by letting Bruce Billson, the small business minister (which is part of Harper's recommendations) support his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer
Spanish researchers have followed women between the age of sixty and eighty years.
Those who eat mainly plants, fish and olive oil have significantly reduced the incidence of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard puts the multiplication table under the sign of the question
Terrence Howard is of the opinion that I completely misunderstood arithmetic.
The negative character in the Empire said to Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think once he's equal to one.
"How can it be equal to one?" he said.
If once I do one, it means that two has no value, because once it itself has no effect.
Once I do two, because the square root of his four is two, so what is the square root of his two?
It should be one, but we're told there's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's professors did not agree with his theory, so he gave up the Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
"I mean you can't close your eyes when you know something's wrong in yourself," he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics the name "Terryology".
The actor confesses that he spends his time cutting and reassembling prefabricated, wire, magnets and was plastic to illustrate his theory "once upon a time" and other similar theories of his.
He told the magazine that he and his former wife, Mira Pak, spent up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The Rolling Stone editor described Howard's creations as "complex, two-dimensional, and three-dimensionally inter-linked coarse or magnetized.
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive the American patent 20150079872 A1 (“Systems and methods for improved construction materials”).
Also, the actor of "Following an Idol" says that Pitagora Einstein and Tesla would "take her mad" if she saw Terryology.
"You know," he says, "I've been wondering since I was three or four years old why does a ball take a round shape?"
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard added that he hopes to change the whole course of learning.
"This will be the last century when our children will learn that once they do one," he said.
They will no longer be needed to grow in ignorance.
In twenty years now, they'll know that once I do two.
We're about to reveal a new truth.
The true universal mathematical.
We'll check in 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
On Tuesday, during the show "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Agülera.
The 22-year-old pop star sang little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, playing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then displaying his vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with the voice of Aguilera.
In turn, Fallon did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
Both of them also interpreted the versions of "I't Feel My Face" from The Weeknd.
This week, Grande's name has always appeared in the press.
On the same day it was also at "Good Morning America", where it opened the show with the incident of the gogoaça lens.
Taco Bell hopes that the "Cantina" restaurants where they will serve will become points of urban interest
Would you like to spend an elegant evening in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On September 22, the Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain will open a new location in the area of Wicker Park in Chicago, offering a menu of tapas aperitifs, a fresh painting by a local artist and even alcoholic drinks.
It is the first test location of the Taco Bell Cantina restaurants, which is addressed to young people, concentrated in growing numbers in the city centers.
Taco Bell, which has nearly 6,000 restaurants in the United States, has its roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap food, fast-prepared, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With an average payment note of USD 7 Taco Bell, the company used drive-through and fast services to attract the number of customers needed to make a profit.
However, Taco Bell states that in order to address the new generation who "seek the most central urban environment in which to live, work and have fun", the test sites must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and cheaper options.
To make a drive-through, you need a field.
Can you imagine what it means to buy an acres of land in an area like Wicker Park?
"Do not allow," said Today Neil Borkan, the Frenchman Taco Bell, who will operate the location in Chicago.
At the location of Chicago, the new menu will be prepared along with traditional Taco Bell offers, in an open kitchen, where "you will see the food on your own" before it is prepared, he told Associated Press Meredith Sandland, head of development at Taco Bell.
The new location will also serve frozen wine, beer and alcoholic beverages, following the recent example of many of the Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks cafes offer “night” menus that include beer, wine and tastings.
A thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic drinks.
The company said another location Taco Bell Cantina will open in San Francisco next to AT&T Park this month, replacing the drive-through service and parking with an indoor courtyard and a window for sale.
These changes in location, atmosphere and annexes indicate that the fast food restaurant chain wants to attract other types of customers outside those who are looking for fast food at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality culinary line in 2012, when he opened Cantina and more expensive burritos menus to compete with Chiptle, the project was supported by an advertising campaign focused on the protein content of new preparations.
If they succeed, the Cantina restaurants will be another step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said he intends to open up 2,000 restaurants in the United States by 2022.
According to Sandland for AP, "a few hundred" of these will be "Cantina" type.
They turned on the phones in the middle of the night: Elton John makes Putin's court
Russian President Vladimir Putin contacted Elton John on Monday night only a few days after the British artist publicly said he wanted to meet the Russian politician to discuss the anti-gay legislation together.
The British singer, gayly declared, unsuccessfully tried to get an interview with Putin while she was in Russia in November 2014, one year after she challenged the protests in this country and held two concerts in 2013, during a period in the history of this state, after the adoption of controversial laws that prohibit "gambling" in the minority.
In 2014, at St. Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and made the following statement in front of fans: "Although I am gay, I have always felt welcome here in Russia".
If I wasn't honest about what I am, I couldn't compose these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express my life.
If we start punishing people for that, then the world will lose humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist devalued that he wanted to meet Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there is no clear information about the telephone discussion between the two personalities.
Cocos has "singed" everything in the ANRP folder
The business man Dorin Cocos is trying to save himself from a crippling condemnation, "sing" all in front of the judges and detailing how millions of euros were allocated to former members of the ANRP Commission.
Yesterday's hearing at the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the case of Alin Cocos, former head of DICOT Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Stabilization of Disbursements in the ANRP, Dorin Cocos was struck by the spark of sincerity.
He acknowledged all the charges and told the judges how he helped businessman George Stelian in the case of ANRP's losses, in exchange for asking him to be tried more quickly and to take into account his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos has shown that he has known George Stelian since 2006 and that he has been engaged in this after several real estate business.
He specified that Sergiu Diacomatu met him in 2010, and he told him that he was working at ANRP.
Later we found that (Diacomatu, n.r.) is Vice-President, and because Georghe Stelian had a file on ANRP, we asked him to help us.
I promised her $2.5 million, the money I told her I'd give her in more cash.
I also promised him political support to remain in office.
"Diacomatu told me when he was helping me, but he needed support," said Dorin Cocos in the courtroom.
He also said that he later came in contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then the head of the Central Disbursement Commission, which promised him 800,000 euros.
For George Stelian's second file, I knew he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatu already had political support, I gave him five million euros.
Crinut Dumitrean a million euros, I gave Dragos Bogdan 800,000 euros.
I make it clear that all of this money was given to him in transit, to make sure that the file was resolved.
"That's what I told them: to solve the file, to pay off," said Cocos.
Asked why he had done these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of George Stelian's second file.
I received, for the second file, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only stayed with 1.2 million euros.
In 2013 I also met Alina Bica.
"I've never talked to this about money or land," said Cocos.
He also showed that "it was of note that at ANRP all members understood before the seat".
I didn't have the emotions that they won't give a positive vote.
All the functions were political in ANRP, but I personally didn't help Diacomatu politics.
"I told him that I only helped him politically to calm him down," Cocos concluded his statement.
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to the DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was on DNA yesterday for just five minutes, while he filed new documents in the "Turceni - Rovinari" file.
Victor Ponta ran away from DNA with a document from the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the case prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the side of the file where he is researched for fake registration under private signature, complicated to tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went on his own initiative to DNA, although the documents he had could have been sent by lawyer.
It wasn't to be like that, the prosecutor's instituted had no time, the first leaving after five minutes, while he left several documents at the register.
I wanted to file a European Court of Justice decision of 3 September, which explains what is going on with service contracts.
I say we've done business, the prosecutor says we haven't done, the European Court of Justice has told us to see each other's work, because, as long as taxes have been paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, certainly, for all European Union countries, we do not have a case here," said Prime Minister Victor Ponta at the time of DNA release.
The bridge further stated that, from a point of view, the decision of the European Court of Justice should apply if we are members of the EU.
Until then, the prime minister expects the prosecutor to read the European Court of Justice's decision and to call it back to hearings, but also to give him an answer to his requests, including reaching the file.
Iohannis is responsible for the mandate without television
In Romania today, there is no legal provision requiring you to watch TV.
And you don't even have such a device, since you pay your TV fee once with your energy bill.
But if you're the head of state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is understood that in the position of the President of Romania it is also included in the record of everyday realities.
President Iohannis is daily immersed in a total list in the office or from Cotroceni
Only that, to the shame of even the closest people you get from the Cotrocene Palace, Klaus Johannis refuses to have TV in the presidential office.
And as soon as he doesn't watch TV - on any program, not even at RTL or Pro Sieben's non-testing posts - the president doesn't listen to radio stations and does not read newspapers.
Moreover, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the predecessor or a priority request.
In return, Iohannis is happy to receive only the report with the news that puts him in a positive light.
And besides this informational self-insulation, where the only break is access to the facebook, much more serious is the blockade towards which, by its passiveness, the head of the state is imposing the entire activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that because, although it's been so bitter for so long since it was installed in office, Yohannis hasn't signed the loyalty statements yet by more than half of the employees of the presidential administration.
What is becoming a more serious problem, both from a human and a legal point of view.
Peace and quiet
Those of the president's entourage are already clear that no one and nothing can ever remove the feng shui from the state's office.
Where there is peace and quiet.
What's right, just after nine o'clock without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when the ex-edil of Sibiu asks for the presence of the officials.
A habit that he probably didn't get rid of from the time he was running the capital of the city of Cibin.
And about the fact that Yohannis doesn't want the TV in the office have already been born countless legends, being already people from the Cotrocene Palace who have come to turn to the version that the president would try to avoid monitoring it.
Especially that he doesn't have any radio.
Only that, at this rate, he will meditate as soon as possible in the dark, because lighting devices can also hide audio-video recording techniques.
All right.
Another strange thing from the Cotroceni Palace is the delivery to the head of state only of the "pozative monitoring" of the president's activity.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Johannis or his wife, the head of state will receive its content on the bureau.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that there was a ban on "negative monitoring" under conditions where, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as a follow-up to the night TV broadcasts in which he was criticized, but asked every morning, with priority, negative news.
That doesn't mean the museum has helped him with something, but that's what the gesture counts!
And at least he can never have an excuse that he wasn't well informed from alternative sources.
Not elsewhere specified or included
Now, until the end of the day, she's lame and the mystery why she doesn't want Klaus Johannis watching TV.
Until then, however, it would be more important to resolve, regardless of the formula, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees of the Presidency.
Who, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of state in charge and who must bear his signature.
Only that, from December and so far, Klaus Johannis did not sign for confirmation at least half of these statements, although this was to take place for no more than 30 days.
Like hundreds of employees, representing more than half of the staff at the Cotroceni Palace have an uncertain situation now.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of state doesn't sign the statement personally, they should be expelled.
Only that all of them didn't get a negative opinion!
So, in a sense, I can come by calling the inspectors of the Court of Auditors, who will find that, over half a year, hundreds of people have received their wages at least somewhere on the edge of the law.
That's what the president decides if he gives them out or confirms their positions, his decision is strict.
Authorities have stated that a teenager launched an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the United States
The ISIS-inspired plan of a teenager to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S. was rather "in aspirational order" than operational, confirmed a police source for Fox News on Tuesday.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August, when the law enforcement authorities completed the plan.
The plan is the same as the representative of Texas, Mike McCaul, President of Internal Security, said a source for Fox News during a Sunday interview.
"We monitor very closely the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States of America," McCaul said at "This Week" from ABC.
Pope Francis was not mentioned as the specific objective of the plan in a bulletin.
Common information from the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, stating that the adolescent was planning to use more attackers, firearms and explosives, aimed at "a foreign demister during a high-level event".
The newsletter mentions that the minority has become radicalised through social networks.
It is possible that the adolescent suffers from a mental illness, a source of law enforcement for Fox News has said, but without giving exact details about the young person’s disease.
Also on Sunday, McCaul acknowledged the potential for an attack by a so-called "single wolf" at the level of the entire nation and noted that he was informed by the Secret Services about a "secret location" for the visit of the Pope.
And with that comes a great risk of security... but as the day approaches, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect him when he gets to the United States.
Matt Dean from Fox News made this material.
The skeleton dating from the medieval period discovered in the tree suffered a violent death, experts say
Irish archaeologists have revealed devastating details about the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found at the root of an old 215-year-old tree.
Collooney’s flag, Sligo, fell during a storm this year, bringing out to light the macabre view of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish National Monuments Service has brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to dig up and analyse remains, thus discovering an exciting story.
"He was killed violently," said Marion Dowd, director of the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, for FoxNews.com.
In the upper part of the chest there are injuries caused by the knife. There is another such trace in the left hand, which suggests that he was trying to defend himself.
The skeleton is of a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that residues are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We cannot tell if he was killed in a fight or in a personal dispute," says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after a Christian ritual, with his head headed west.
"Probably buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd told FoxNews.com that whoever planted the tree didn't know about the tomb.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents attesting that there is a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is another unusual aspect of discovery: the height of the young man.
"Avea 1 meter 77", says Dowd.
For the early medieval society, that means a lot.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies think about food
National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent nearly $1.5 million studying what small children think about food.
The project, called "The way in which babies and small children perceive food" is being carried out by the University of Chicago and has so far established that small people are not prepared to eat lentil foods by other people or by other people.
According to the project's financier, "adequate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have healthy nutritional diets".
There is evidence suggesting that the first food models of infants and young children have long-lasting consequences for the health of their whole life.
The reason for this study is that there is no research on how babies are fed.
“Despite the complexity and significance of food selection, psychologists for the development of the child have been a little surprised to learn how babies and young children perceive, learn and understand food,” said the financer.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social influences on the choice and consumption of food in infants and young children.
Researchers say about babies that they have "limited knowledge in the food field".
Children between the ages of three and six "know more about food than babies and young children", but are "extremely muffuros".
An actress who played in "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of indecent exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played in the TV series "Star Trek: Voyager" was arrested in the east state of Tennessee, accused of being exposed to children.
Several media channels report that Jennifer Ann Lien, a 41-year-old actress who played Kes's role in the television series, is accused of two indecent exposure offences involving children under the age of 13, according to the arrest report.
The officers of the sheriff's office in Roane County brought the arrest warrant on September 3rd to Lien's home in Harriman, where they say they found a blank under a roof on the couch.
Officers said Lien refused their requests to get dressed.
The chief of police in Harriman, Randy Heidle, says that Lien's number of charges were brought to him, including that of corporal damage in an aggravated form, after the April incident in which he said that Lien had entered a police car with a personal car.
She still doesn't know if she's a lawyer.
Police identified the killed victim found in the Epping forest
A man whose body in discomposition was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On 9 September, Hidir Aksakal, 53 years old, was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping forest in north-east London.
The man of Turkish origin lived in Margate, Kent, and had close links to the Green Lanes area in Haringey, North London.
Last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of Monday, August 17.
A postmortem analysis proved that he was killed, and the detectives say his body was probably in the Epping forest for weeks.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo of the Metropolitan Police said: “Mr. Aksakal was very well-known at the local level as Boxer Cetin and we hope to find information from the Green Lanes community that will help us in our research.
Hollow Ponds is a popular and crowded tourist resort, where there is a cafe and a lake for boat walks.
It is also surrounded by streets with intense traffic.
We ask all those who have been in the area in the last few weeks and may have noticed some unusual activity or suspected, to come and discuss with us.
Super boss: six women juggle between maternity and service
Unlike any other country in the world, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, there is no centralized policy on maternity leave in the United States.
Two weeks ago, when Yahoo's executive director Marissa Mayer announced that she was pregnant with twins, but she was going to take a very short maternity leave and "work in her spare time", the 40-year-old woman was criticized on a large scale for encouraging a culture that awaits the superwoman or nothing.
But Mayer, she herself a symbol of the top woman, to be guilty of unrealistic expectations?
How do other women's leaders handle it?
Seema Patel, a lawyer and deputy director of the San Francisco Labour Standards Office, just got a job in the government in Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss surprised her with an unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," her boss told her.
But if you're going to make a family in the future, grab hold of your leave from now on.
Patel's employee was the federal government, and she didn't even get a maternity leave paid as part of her employment contract.
At the time, Patel was single and very focused on her career, and the family was the last thing she thought about.
But she listened to the advice of her boss.
She avoided using her days of medical leave for four years, so when she was pregnant with her first child, two years ago, she was confined to three months of paid leave.
Six months ago, when the second child was born, Patel could no longer apply the same strategy.
The four months of leave she took were entirely unpaid.
Patel says she didn't feel any rejection from her colleagues, but she has a problem with the structure of work.
"I find it very discouraging for anyone trying to have a family," she says.
Send a message: Your country doesn't value you becoming a parent.
Karen Choi, Vice-President of the Capital Group asset management company, says that any woman employed who is and mother should be commended.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes the juggle between mother's quality and job as "a constant struggle".
The secret not to suffocate is to have "an incredible family with you" and a nice and babysitter, to accept that there are things that will not be the best (“not everyone can be Martha at home”) and just go through it.
Choi says she took an increasing maternity leave for each child, starting from two months and half for the first and ending six months for the last.
That makes her an exception, especially in her area of activity.
When your child is sick, he has fever, vomiting, and you stay all night to take care of him and you know that the next morning you have to take the other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it gets very complicated," she says.
However, her company supported it and noted that the performance of her investment portfolio had nothing to do with it.
When she went into the finance industry, after college, about 20 of her college colleagues took the same path, she said.
Today, about 90% of them gave up.
The women who quit their job, then start again, they don't have the same chances at top paid well, she says.
It is difficult to stay: "In the short term it is a sacrifice, but in the long term the results are seen".
Anyway, her children helped her to make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me go further is that I would like to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates scientific researcher and Professor Kelly Posner, at the age of 48.
Children know that their mother is helping to save human lives.
Posner, founder and director of the Center for the Evaluation of the Risk of Suicide at Columbia University, says it is important for women to know that they can have a "great objective" in terms of their career and to meet it.
It's very important for women to think I can have a vision.
Most people don't let themselves believe this," she says.
He once held a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a Webinar, when he was charged for eight months.
She also helped with technology, she says, because she can stop the car and answer the phone after taking the kids or answering an e-mail from the walk.
The yoke between maternity and an applicant career has been helped by an optimistic personality, inclined to solve problems, she says. The ability to bring things to a successful end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, aged 33, the executive director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and the mother of two children, says that making motherhood and career work together only through private help networks, such as bonds, is wrong.
"You should not be lucky or win the lottery to succeed," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning very small wages, the poor health system and the lack of a paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't care about each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who were just born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while attending law school, gave birth to her baby while she was in high school.
With a husband and a child on the basis of the medical assistance provided by the scholarship, the head of the field of work was able to take a maternity leave of only two weeks, then returned to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashionist and mother of two children, says that fewer women will abandon their profession if they receive more social support, in the form of day care services from companies, maintaining programs established by common agreement and accepting that efficient work does not mean staying over the program.
In the face of the logistical constraints, says Mosko, there is the additional pressure to act in a field where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitomous lack of taste (“mammary clothes” is one of the most serious insults).
"The image is part of our job - either lift you up or pull you down," she explains.
Mosko's "Permanent Negotiation" for its multiple roles to function harmoniously means to keep its appearance and a beautiful bag in its hand, from which to sometimes fall a double toy.
If she remembers that men are fathers, society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers to the extent that they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, President and Executive Director of the New York Housing Authority, which deals with the homes of over 400,000 New Yorkers and has over 11,000 employees, says that maternity and career does not mean talking about "equilibre".
The notion of balance is a bit inappropriate.
She looks more like a balance sheet," she says.
Three children's mother, one of whom has only three months, just took a maternity leave seven weeks after she was born this year.
"It was a very important period for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to get her paternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible program, which means to leave early or late, so that she could breastfeed her child.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning ending at 06:00 (“more cheap than therapy”) is still breast-feeding.
At work, he tried to create an environment "friendly to parents", where a child's delay is allowed, and the reply to e-mails should not be sent safely from the office.
"The concept and family concept have changed and change very much," Olatoye says.
"The family is very different from what was 25 or even 10 years ago".
The job is the one that needs to be adapted.
Russian murderers say they fooled Elton John about a call from Putin.
For cynicals it seemed too nice to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, to Sir Elton John, a singer and militant for the rights of sexual minorities, in which to discuss the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it was not true: despite an exuberant post on Instagram in which he thanked the Russian leader for dealing with the problem, it immediately became clear that anyone who called him last night would certainly not have been Putin.
The Kremlin has already said he had no knowledge of that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two famous Russian murderers admitted that they, not the president, were foreign voices at the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was a little unlikely that Putin wanted to meet him or call him, or at least not too soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague, Alexei "Lexus" Stoliarov, became the spokesperson for President Dmitri Peskov.
"But it seems that Elton John was really expecting this phone, so he immediately thought that it was really a conversation with the right people we were giving us," he told the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.
He said, "Thank you, it was the surprise of the day."
This day and this conversation were the most wonderful and most enjoyable of my life.
To fulfill John's plight, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation on a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives didn't make statements about the farce speculation.
The story is based on the comments made by the singer during the weekend, in which he criticised Putin for his “religion” attitude towards homosexuals while the LGBT rights campaign in Kiev, criticizing in particular a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of “propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations” among minors.
"I would like to meet [Putin], to talk," John told the BBC, saying that although the idea was "probably unrealistic", it still deserves a trial.
Then, Monday evening, the singer voiced the distrust of some observers when he published a message on a social network, claiming that Putin answered his critics by taking the phone and calling it.
He said he "waits eagerly to meet [the president] in front of him to discuss LGBT equality in Russia".
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one at the end of the line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for the phones given in the fun of many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks well English, played Peskov's role and claimed to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov told reporters on Tuesday that Putin would be "ready to meet Elton John and answer all his questions", but that no such request was received from the singer at Kremlin.
The Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of the Instagram post, he added, "especially because it is not entirely written in a correct English".
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written anything like grammar mistakes.
Even before the Russian duel declared his public duty, local media channels were already suspected of John being the victim of a joke.
Some online users identify Krasnov as guilty, known for the farcees made by the telephone politicians they record and post on their YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Phone calls to public people, then publishing the recordings have become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many as the initiator of the genre, has developed his talent to make Ukrainian politicians farce.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television imitating Anton Gerašchenko, the direct adviser to the Interior Minister, Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Geraschenko so well that last year he spoke to the former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomiski, better than six hours in several days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections, which led to massive street protests following massive fraud reports.
As Arkadi Dvorkovich, the councillor of President Dmitri Medvedev since then, convinced the president of the electoral commission Vladimir Churov that Medvedev intended to fire him.
In addition to numerous Russian celebrities, among his victims were former president of the USSR Mihail Gorbaciov, chief of Kiev and champion of the Vitali Klitschko box and Russian sports minister Vitali Mutko, who tricked him to apologize for the behavior of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called Belarus President Aleksandr Lukaşenko, acting as the son of the Ukrainian leader who resigned, Viktor Ianukokovici.
It was so convincing that the person from the other end, whose voice resembled Lukasenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to discuss with Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.
Lawyer Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the "propaganda" law, told The Guardian that John should not disturb Putin with a "so irrelevant subject" and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain Russia's position.
Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online survey for readers, in which 39% of respondents were of the opinion that Putin and John should meet, and 22% thought that such a meeting would damage Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, more than 3 million people a year die early because of air pollution from outside, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is wood and coal burned for heating houses and cooking, but research reveals that agricultural emissions in Europe and the USA are such an alarming reason for these deaths.
The report warns that if no action is taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projects should signal an alarm to public health agencies around the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, an environmental expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by air rain are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deep into the lungs.
They cause heart attack and heart attack, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million annual deaths, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
The research did not include the effects of indoor air pollution, for example from cooking fires, which are estimated to cause another 3.4 million deaths a year.
The new study, published in the Nature newspaper, is the first to highlight various sources of external air pollution and estimated the number of premature deaths caused by them, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuel-based and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computerized model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on the various populations, including new information on how pollution affects the people of China and India.
A third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of fuels that smoke, such as wood and coal, for heating homes or cooking, and the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all of which are recognized dangers.
The consumption of this type of domestic energy causes half of the 645 000 annual deaths in India and one third of the 1.4 million annual deaths in China.
However, the research found that ammonia agricultural emissions had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of the German Chemical Max Planck Institute, which led the research.
A fifth of deaths at global level are caused by these emissions, mainly from cattle, birds and pigs and from excessive use of fertilisers.
Ammonia reacts with exhaust gases from traffic and industry and produces tiny particles, being the main reason for the deaths due to air pollution from the US east, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," says Lelieveld.
In the United Kingdom, 48% of the premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing a fifth of the deaths, despite measures against pollutants.
This has only caused 5% of deaths globally, but the figure could increase as more and more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
The air pollution by the plants, in particular by those operating with coal, was significant at global level, causing one of the seven deaths.
In the United States it is the main single factor, causing one third of the 55,000 deaths annually, compared to 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in arid and dusty regions, has caused nearly one fifth of the deaths globally caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, responsible for 92% of deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"The overlap between the high level of pollution and the large number of inhabitants is saying the word about public health, but nothing else is known about the sources of pollution responsible for premature deaths," Jerrett says.
The results are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health at the global level.
All particles are now assumed to be as toxic.
However, if fuel burning is more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be lower.
Even so, says Jerrett "the discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and suggests that much more attention should be paid to agricultural sources, both by scientists and political leaders".
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmospheric specialist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: “The study itself underlines the need for air quality control, to avoid these deaths, especially in very popular areas in Asia”.
A statement by Victor Ponta tensions and more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Pontius Pilate to stop lying, the Roman Prime Minister speaks of attitudes that bring to mind Nazism
Relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement of the construction of a border fence with Romania, after the Serbian border, have experienced a new deploration following statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused the authorities from Budapest Monday of treating refugees "with beating and insertation".
Hungary's diplomacy has reacted strongly to the "extremist and false" statements, but Victor Ponta has not given up on it and has accused government officials in the neighbouring country of being "a shame" for Europe.
Noted that it is not for the first time when Ponta is trying to strain Roman-Hungarian relations by statements made at delicate times or with an electoral character.
It all started with a statement made Monday by Victor Ponta, in which he tried to argue that Romania could not receive more than 1,800 refugees.
The problem you have with our logistical ability to treat those people like some people, not how they treat our Hungarian neighbors with battle and inseria.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu put himself in the face of an ugly and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, namely a xenophobic feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but it's up to us to solve the problem.
"We will treat those people as we do," said Victor Ponta, quoted by the Truth on Monday.
It is not clear what Victor Ponti referred to when he spoke of the inclusion of refugees, but the Czech Republic was recently in the centre of criticism after writing numbers on the hands of migrants in several trains, in a gesture that remembered the procedure used by the Nazis to identify Jewish prisoners from concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto, according to the Hungarian news agency MTI, taken over by Magyaridok.hu, appreciated that the internal political crises that have shaken Victor Ponta's position make him make the "extremist and false" statements.
The Romanian businessman from Budapest was summoned to provide explanations, reports Mediafax, quoting MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inappropriate statements about how Hungary manages the immigrants' crisis," the Hungarian Foreign Ministry states.
Levente Magyar, secretary of state for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in Hungary, expressed "surprising" about "the constant attempts of Victor Ponta to save his controversial moral position through anti-ungary lies", underlines Budapest's diplomacy.
"I do not want to respond to the challenges posed by a representative of the German government - but you read the report below and you will understand the indignation I feel, as a European man and citizen, against the attitudes and attitudes that Europe has only seen in the 1930s!" wrote Ponta, on his Facebook account.
He argues that, like other European politicians, he has the "duty" to draw attention and sanction "the constant behaviour of senior government officials in Hungary" who are "a shame for European Union culture and values" by "anti-Semitic attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"The gimpata scar, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only appear to be political decisions in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees fled!", accused Ponta, claiming that he believes in "solidarity, rational and sustainable solutions, and above all in the European values", and "what we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction just with these objectives and values!"
During the evening, Ponta was invited to Antenna 3, where the main subject was Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Victor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if the German soldiers would catch up and shoot or kill some children or women, in a speech in which he made more references to Nazism.
In the dispute, UDMR president Kelemen Hunor also intervened, who considered that the Roman authorities should not have a " sentimental approach" in relation to Hungary's intention to build a fence at the border.
UDMR's leader claims that he must understand that this solution is not directed against Romania or Roman citizens, claiming that the guard might even help our country not to become an intensive transit route for migrants who will reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to stress, I say, that we don't have to marry, take this whole thing as something against Romania, and don't have to use it to make relationships worse anyway, not too good between the two governments, because it's not.
I think any sentimental approach, visceral is not okay.
"We need to see the rational part, see why we have arrived here and we need to know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, Roman citizens, and it does not prevent free movement between the two states within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The news ignored in 2012 Russia's offer to take Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership
Russia has now proposed that the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, as part of a peace agreement, should be allowed more than three years now, according to an official high level involved at that time in the negotiations with the doors closed between the western states and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
Finland's former president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari said Western powers have not benefited from the proposal since.
From 2012 until now, tens of thousands of people have died and millions more have been forced to flee the country, giving birth to the most serious refugee crises since the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari held talks with the representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (USA, United Kingdom, France, the Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
It further stated that during the discussions, the Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churchin offered a plan that included among others and the proposal addressed to Assad to give up power at a given time after the beginning of the peace talks between the regime and the opposition.
She proposed three things:
One - we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we must start a dialogue between Assad and the opposition immediately.
"Three - we have to look for an elegant way to withdraw Assad," Ahtisaari said, referring to the position of the Russian ambassador.
However, he said Ahtisaari, the United States, Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator would fall, even though they ignored the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was a lost opportunity in 2012," Finland's former president continued.
Russia has officially firmly supported Bashar al-Assad over the four and a half years of war, insisting that its intruder cannot represent a proposal in any peace agreement.
So he thinks Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow has recently begun sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilize Assad's regime and to confront the extremists of the Islamic State.
The Antenna 3 live programme will be available at a cost
Antenna 3 informed the viewers on Tuesday that since 1 November the program or live will be able to be viewed online at a cost based on a monthly subscription.
In a "record to viewers", the Intact Trust News Post states that "we are doing this with the heart of the stranger, wanting to stay with us and in this new stage, imposed by the conditions of the market".
According to the same message, the subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who follow us online", promising that the viewing will be of very good quality.
Antenna 3 argues that "all these live broadcasts from the country and abroad, the campaigns, daily news were and are possible through a constant financial effort, assumed, which assumed permanent re-enology and quality focus".
We managed to support ourselves, under conditions where offline and online distributors have contributed nothing to the content offered.
The announcement comes under conditions where the news television program is accessible on the basis of subscription and online Antena Play platform, where otherwise, the most often exclusive and recording of Antena’s broadcasts were accessible.
Reports show that animal populations and marine plants have averaged over the last 40 years
The scale of the crisis faced by marine animals and plants is documented in detail in a study that states that marine species from around the globe, including those essential for human food security, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Unprecedented pressures from several directions at the level of the global ocean ecosystem combine and create a wave of difficulties for almost all marine living, says the WWF's report "Live Blue Planet".
Coral reefs are subjected to serious declination risks (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and seaweed, of which many other species depend, have recorded a significant decline, while entire fish populations with commercial value, such as macro and tuna, have dropped sharply by three quarters before the 1970s, the report shows.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical ocean forests due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened by extinction up to half this century if ocean acidity continues to deteriorate, resulting in increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, resulting in a directly proportional increase in the level of carbon dioxide in the sea.
"The healthy seas are an extraordinary source of beauty and natural wonder and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, chief marine policy adviser at WWF-UK, who contributed to the report's completion.
"By overfishing, which is damaging coastal habitats, and without solving the global warming problem, we are sowing seeds of an ecological economic catastrophe," says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of published scientific literature, but also on the Earth's Indexes, a database maintained by the Zoological Society of London, is one of the most detailed marine life studies ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It researched a wide variety of marine species, from fish, brown sea turtles and sea turtles - a worm-like animal with rough skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that algae areas decreased by approximately 30% in the last century, while total mangrove areas decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
During a single generation, human activity has caused huge damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
Deep changes are needed to ensure an abundant ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, Director General of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have been recorded in fish species for commercial profits.
For example, 58 populations of 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae family - macrou, tone and sardines - have dropped by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without showing signs of recovery, says the report.
We are in a course of fishing that could end with people looking at a vital source of food and an essential economic engine.
Overfishing, the destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and the poor communities, based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and strongest," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic downturn and could undermine our fight for poverty eradication and sub-nutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, ZL’s scientific director, said: “These alarming figures prove how fast they change the plants and animals of the oceans and are a clear warning of the problems we could face as a result.”
Seagrass: deep seabeds, which capture rich sediments in minerals and stabilize the seabed.
Over the last century, the cover area has decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Nearly 20% of all mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly because of human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of all marine species live in coral reefs or near them, but three quarters of them are currently threatened and many may disappear during this century if ocean acidity continues to worsen.
Deep-sea habitats: very little is known about the deepest ocean areas, but the decline in fish catches in these inaccessible locations over the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by marine changes at global level.
Steven Gerrard denies the accusations of racism that would have been brought to him by his former teammate at Liverpool, El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his autobiography in "My Story" ("My Story"), serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes the Senegalese player by saying that he is "not really interested in football" and that he is the colleague who liked "the least" in the 17-year-olds at the club.
As a response, Diouf would have responded to the Senegalese radio station Groupe Futurs Media, with quoted sentences attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked the colouring people".
Gerrard's lawyers denied any charges of racism brought by him.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who had already made himself public and before the bad opinion of Diouf, criticized the attitude and degree of professionalism of his former colleague.
"I don't want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his jealous seasons at Liverpool as an example of how things can go on track," he writes.
"It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and that he doesn't care about Liverpool at all," he continued.
For example, the way he sparked a huge and vicious flag in a Celtic fan in a Cup Uefa game at Parkhead in March 2003 is proof of his deplorable and ranchiunous behavior.
Diouf proved himself a controversial figure all the time spent on Anfield, his most famous night being Celtic Park.
The previous Senegalese was interrogated by police after the spitting episode and amended with the countervalidation of his salary for two weeks at the club, the amount of 60,000 pounds being given to a humanitarian organisation at the Celtic election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as lazy and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard wrote.
I felt that he wasn't just willing to make every effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who is now playing at the Malaysian Sabah club, criticized him, in his turn, in public Gerrard and attacked Gerrard's old friend and teammate Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerrard "egoist" and claimed that Anfield did not like the player who led the team to win the Champions League in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is "jelos".
He said: “Gerrard is just jealous of me.
He didn't touch the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the Chief's status, and he lives there.
I am respected in the world of football, the greatest football experts have framed me among the first seven players at the World Championship and among the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't have a feeling of belonging.
Wherever I go in other countries, I'm revered, while Gerrard is runaway every time he leaves his hometown Liverpool.
From the hero to the professional dancer: the quick way of Alek Scarlatos to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Scarlatos does not only play the role of hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic guy, equally discreet and modern, the producers say.
"There are many categories and we are always looking for the most popular moment," said Deena Katz, an executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear he'll find his prints after that.
It's charming.
He's got something special.
Before he competed at the famous show - but only weeks before - Scarlatos arrived in the international press after he took a stand against a major danger.
He and the two friends of his childhood, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, immobilized a man armed with an AK-47 in a train full of travelers going from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three have stopped what could have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
After that, 22-year-old Scarlatos received a phone call from President Obama, a message on Twitter from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although it may anticipate some local assessments - Friday, at Sacramento, there was a parade in the youth's neighborhood - there was not expected so many positive reactions or an invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"I wouldn't have thought in a million years I'd get this offer," Scarlatos confessed on Saturday, in a break from the dance rehearsals with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy.
Even though before the show of the evening, he recognized that he was "silently excited", he managed as a professional at his first Foxtrot, getting points that brought him almost to the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said they offered one of the best performances of the series.
Katz and the executive producer from "DWTS" Rob Wade said they want to keep a free place in the show for competitors invited in the last hundred meters, as is the case of Scarlatos, who grew up in the eyes of the public.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation, who committed an armed attack on a 500-pass train and immediately thought to invite one of them to the dance competition.
He searched the social networks, found family members and sent messages to Scarlatos.
When he appeared at "Good Morning America" to tell the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the program from ABC to avoid going through all media bars.
He supported the five-minute plea, and then looked forward to finding out if Scarlatos would agree to participate in the DWTS.
"For a while it was very uncertain, because this is so different why he does," Katz confessed.
A little while ago, he was fighting in Afghanistan, and now I'm asking him if he has a dancing boss.
Scarlatos, who is in a short vacation from the National Guard, didn't even see an entire show until recently.
She hesitated to participate, mainly because she didn't want to be just him.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ace in their hand: Noah Galloway, a war veteran, with their hands and feet amputated.
They encouraged Scarlatos to call Galloway, the favorite fan and finalist of the past season, and ask him about his experience.
That was probably the critical point, along with Katz's uninterrupted "treasure" and "insistence messages," she said.
"Noah is a great guy and I wanted to know how the army will be confronted and how my friends' image will be protected," Scarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Scarlatos, a great lover of sport and history, never danced until then, and Arnold testified in interviews that he was trying to make him relax and give up his military position quite rigidly.
But Katz says it is confident that it will adapt and that viewers will react positively.
He will receive much love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and of what he has done.
"How can you not stand it?" said Katz.
But this will only take a few weeks.
To go further, he has to dance.
Scarlatos, who is a fool and wants to become a cop, says that until now he's had fun in this totally unknown environment.
The program represented the hardest fight, and it was necessary to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the times when it was celebrated in the media and the various premiere ceremonies.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the United States immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with his family.
"This lasted about a day and a half," he said.
Totally, I stayed at home for four days.
There is a risk of reaching a person who attracts media attention, but is not used to being in the light of reflectors, executive Wade producer said.
And the show wants to make sure that the competitor manages and has fun.
"The pressure is great and we want participants to have a pleasant experience," Wade said.
"I don't want Alex to ever say, "Aoleu, what did I do?"
Let's keep his fists to have fun.
McRib from McDonald's is back.
The time has come for those waiting all year for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-coasts to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of the French McDonald's in the country offers this season specialty.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served McRib sandwich.
"McRib's 2015 promotion is attended by approximately 8000 restaurants," McDonald's spokesman Lisa McComb said for The Times in an e-mail.
In the United States there are less than 14 300 restaurants of this fast-food.
However, according to McComb, individual French owners decide whether or not to serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," McComb says.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they think their local customers want.
And if you still wonder what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain its ingredients last year, with a video that shows reality.
According to the video, McRib sandwich is prepared from pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year, at McDonald's participating restaurants.
There is also a website where McRib (unaffiliated at McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can search the nearest place where this sandwich is served.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the closest restaurant with McRib de Los Angeles is in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.

Keith Richards suggests that new Rolling Stones recordings are being prepared
Keith Richards is again in the light of the reflectors with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, and other members of the Rolling Stones group could join them in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others at Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - met recently in London and made "clear registration plans", as he says.
On Tuesday evening, Richards spoke in the ICNS series from iHeartRadio to reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the first LP of the band after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the team wasn't idle at all.
In recent years they have had many tournaments on stadiums and played in several small concerts in L.A., including representatives at the Echoplex and the Theatre Foundation.
Finally, they reinterpreted the classic LP in 1971, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular, Richards was employed this year, working with the documentary "Keith Richards: Under the Influence", scheduled to be launched on September 18 on Netflix.
This year, he released the single album "Crosseyed Heart", his third solo in a five-decade career.
Randy Lewis of The Times described Richards' new album in a previous interview with the guitarist: "Always Richards' voice is a more kind instrument than distinguished...."
But Richards gets excited in all 15 songs of the album and that always meant, in fact, the rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards says the team will most likely enter the studio after the South American tournament from the beginning of next year.
He did not give any other details, but judging after the last concerts, the band is still very full of life.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman about childhood, maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already gone through some difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet drug that made them seem much simpler than they were.
When an actor was a child in television broadcasts such as "Silver Spoons", as an adult, he reaffirmed himself as an unexpressed character in the television series "Situation of the Crisis" and in films such as "Chief of the Cosmar".
The first film he worked as a director was a very acidic comedy "Bad Words", in which he played.
The film was nominated at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious tonal film, adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The script is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the film he plays Nicole Kidman and Bateman, as brothers with problems.
The film is the subject of a festival looking for American distribution.
Many book reviews have considered it a comedy with powerful emotional tent; the film reinterprets the story, placing more emphasis on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview given to our publication on Tuesday, Bateman says he always considered the book more drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen such a book," he confessed.
In the book, subject and topics are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was dealing with a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of generosity and comedy and eccentricity.
The world premiere of the evening was won by an introduction by the program director of the festival, Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm especially for the sitcom "The Hogan Family" since the late 1980s and early 1990s, where he worked at Bateman. "I did not meet too many fans "Hogan Family", Bateman said dry when he went on the stage.
However, the few episodes he directed from that sitcom brought Bateman, now 46 years old, to Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new movie has a family called Fang in the center.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their shows, for example by putting in place a bank robbery with academies or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) are trying to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, although she's named rather for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is a novelist and journalist of magazines trying to get famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappeared in mysterious surroundings, Annie and Baxter suspected it was just another trick of theirs and tried to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what the story of the children who want to evolve in adult life has reflected directly and deeply in Batman.
"My childhood was a very typical one," Bateman confesses.
I started acting when I was 10 years old, with parents like managers, and this movie has a lot of elements that conflict with the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as superficial and fun.
"It's a story that I feel connected to and that I understand in depth," he added, "and although I didn't try to add my personal experience to it, I knew very clearly how to show this film to represent children with a non-traditional childhood".
The project started with Kidman, and she produced the film, which obtained rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, Lindsay-Abaire was co-operated, who adapted his own play "Treasure to Reality", where Kidman played.
Bateman confesses that he accepted the chance to direct the film and played in it.
(Kidman, currently on the stage in London in the production of "Photograph 51", did not participate in the first month.
The person in the book was in public.)
In the Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called the Bateman's film "a smart and caustic adaptation" which "gives much too much use to the clichés of the dysfunctional family and sometimes to the mission of a lifetime to understand their parents in ways that can be fun and sweet-sweet, incisive and usually very dark".
In Variety, Justin Chang named the film "a very sharp portrait" and noted that Bateman "proves visible progress and greater maturity as film director with this structured, but never too slow or mechanical adaptation".
After the month forecast, when Bateman and Walken went on stage for the question session, the public ovated the multi-bit Walken.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the question session that “I was impressed every day.
I didn't come to believe the ease with which they change the work of film director, which is very difficult, and the actor on stage.
His concentration is really amazing.
In a certain dialogue scene, Bateman stands on a ladder in the family house behind the frame, hidden in anger, only a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and is more clearly visible.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman's actor discussing with Bateman's director that he can't be seen.
"It seems incredible to me to direct films," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to benefit me as an actor.
Having a privileged position to be responsible for creating all the public experience, not just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, is a complete thing.
No matter what that... actor wants a prime plan.
During the question-and-answer session, Bateman testified that after reading the script, he immediately thought about Walken for Caleb's role, but also about the composer Carter Burwell for the sound column.
Known mainly for long-term friendship with Coen brothers, Burwell has composed a sound column for two other films present at the Toronto Festival: the animated film "Anomaliesa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Legend Gangsters", by Brian Helgeland about the English gangster twins of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell composed the sound column and for Todd Haynes's "Carol" movie.
"The long-tone or obtuse lights seem very interesting to me," Bateman says, giving more explanations on Tuesday.
To navigate through those tones and guide the harmonious audience and somehow elegant from one tone to the next during the film.
Carter has built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate among the most complicated tones.
With "The Family Fang", Bateman took another bold step, both director and actor, in a career dominated by reinventation and determination, a mix of comedy and drama, light and darkness.
As Bateman testified when he finished his film introduction at the world premiere of the months, "Well, unfortunately, it came out exactly as I wanted".
The festival wants that in Oscars about the Boston Globe investigation story about pedophile priests
Did you win $240,000 in the lottery?
An X-LOTTO ticket worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for a month.
The unregistered ticket to extract X-Lotto was purchased from the English Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd on Saturday, 15 August.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, another 16 winning entries throughout Australia have been registered, which have shared the estimated 4 million-dollar X-Lotto single premium fund.
SA Lotteries asks all those who bought tickets at X-Lotto from England Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the X-Lotto 3555 extraction on Saturday, 15 August, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, the manager of the English Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he is looking forward to receiving the good news that the one who won the biggest prize checked his ticket at X-Lotto.
"We've tried to spread the news out of shyness, because a person is our winner and has no idea," she said.
Detectives at the crime scene are searching the house on Beadell Street, Burton, where the last time the missing man Daniel Hind was seen
Hind's sister Chelsea Hind said it's frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of her trip the night she was last seen.
Her family asked the police to search her home ever since her brother disappeared.
"I was hoping they'd search the house, we weren't informed they'd do it," she said.
Mrs. Hind said that her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four kids and we have a lot of other family members and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half think he's not.
Anyway, we want him home and end the stories.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometers of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 kilometres of new highways and repair 17,000 kilometres of existing main and secondary roads.
The completion of work for Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina motorways, all of which are part of pan-European transport corridors, is among the priorities of the road infrastructure development plan approved on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable rail infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure increased road safety and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for the trafficking of cultural goods from Syria
According to the Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for the illicit trafficking of cultural goods stolen from the Middle East, due to its geographical location.
During a speech held on Wednesday at a conference on the fight against the theft of the Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation was re-established to fit the new context, stressing the prohibition of cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of the Interior, in particular of the Directorate-General for the "Fighting of Organized Crime" (GDBOP) focused on preventing smuggling and illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have placed on the third place, after Italy and Greece, in the top of property and cultural property.
Bulgaria's Interior Minister has also shown that trafficking in cultural objects and destruction of historical sites such as Iraq and Syria is a phenomenon that has taken on a large scale, described as an extremely serious war crime.
He stressed the need for concerted and decisive measures to stop the deliberate destruction of history.
Director General UNESCO, Irina Bokova, mentioned that films of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria demonstrate that the country is affected by industrial robbery.
Participants at the Wednesday conference acknowledged that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously endangered and that the international community must join in order to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods from the end of the war.
Rocketyne Aerojet says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
On Tuesday, Rocketdyne Holdings Inc said it is expected to complete the new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a Russian engine that will be banned soon, but the date could be changed if it does not receive enough funds from the US government.
Vice-President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to make statements about the fact that Aerojet offered $2 billion to buy the United Launch Alliance (ULA), a mixed company with equal actions for rocket launches from Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say the amount proposed is a Aerojet's strategic move to cross the Blue Origin rival, a company owned by the founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, who develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan rocket.
ULA says the Blue Origin engine program is about two years before the Ar-1 engine from Aerojet, a statement that Aerojet contradicts.
The work on the new engines became a priority after US legislators approved a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for the launch of U.S. military or spy satellites, following the accession of Ukraine's Crimean Region by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck claims that Aerojet tests hardware for the engine, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to match both the Atlas 5 ULA rocket, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and the new Vulcan rocket that ULA develops and costs approximately $1 billion.
The aircraft says it will be less costly and less risky to integrate its engine into the Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a brand new engine and rocket, as ULA currently intends.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet planned to start testing large-scale engines in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be delayed if the company does not receive sufficient funds from the Air Force in contracts expected at the end of the first half of the fiscal year 2016, which starts in October.
It further states that the whole company was eager to see how the Air Force would share a funding of approximately USD 160 million between rival competitors.
It also says that Aerojet was planning to try other private funding options for the engine, but did not offer details.
Competition from the Air Forces is a public-private partnership and each bidder must provide a third of the funding and the Air Forces cover two thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies (Space Exploration Technologies), or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both of which are private companies, have self-funded the engine creation process and say it does not seek unrestricted funding from the government.
AB InBev brewery company intends to merge worth USD 275 billion with SABMiller
Anheuser-Bush InBev (ABI.BR), the world's largest beer-producing company, addressed the rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) about a takeover that would form a colostrum that would produce a third of the world's total volume of beer.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately USD 275 billion at current prices and would combine AB InBev's dominance in Latin America with SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development, but also their beer factories in Asia.
"The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also several places in Asia and Latin America," analyst Andrew Holland from the General Society said.
AB InBev and other top beer manufacturers are trying to get into new markets and strengthen their weak points in North America and Europe, where consumers are increasingly preferring beer produced by independent players or wine or alcoholic beverages.
SABMiller, a company located on the second world stage and the producer of over 200 brands of beer, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday that it was informed by AB InBev's intention to make an offer to it, which must happen by 14 October at the latest, in accordance with British law.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund administered by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its policy of reducing the costs of marketing socoteal, has previously orchestrated the acquisition of Burger King, the ketchup producer Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
An appropriate source of SAB mentioned that it is too early to say what it will do, as they have not received any offer.
"At this point, we are in the stage we expect and decide," the source said.
Speculations regarding a merger, which would most likely raise concerns about the infringement of competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, have been running for several years.
The moment of approach, after a decade of acquisitions by AB InBev, follows a decline of approximately 15% of the SABMiller stock price from August.
"It's exactly the moment they were expecting," analyst Phil Gorham from Morningstar said.
Financially, for the first time in many years, it has logic.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 lire (62 USD) for SAB Miller's share, perhaps even 45 lire, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to USD 130 billion, which would also include SABMiller's debt.
This would do the most significant M&A transaction in 2015, which is already announced a year after the financial crisis in 2008 from the point of view of the transaction, and one of the biggest purchases in 1980 there.
The shares of the SAB amounted to 19.9% at 36.14 lire, giving them a stock exchange capitalisation of $90 billion.
AB's shares in InBev reached 6.4%.
Rivali Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could seek another merger as defence strategy, as it happened in the previous year when it was offered to buy Heineken, but failed.
Since then, the African bottler has combined cool drinks with Coca-Cola (KO.N), and in recent weeks there has been a likelihood of a combination with Diageo or with Australian Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
The global market share of AB InBev, the Budweiser producer, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1% in 2014, while SABMiller was 15%, according to the Plato Logic industry experts.
AB InBev intends to report on the net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) 2 times from the current 2.5.
It is possible to achieve the objective in 2016, the closest realistic date to which the transaction could be closed, so that it would have a way to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought Budweiser's company, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with USD 52 billion, the biggest purchase of ice money in history at that time.
Such a large climb would allow them to accumulate a debt of 100 billion.
The families that control AB InBev hold a little more than half of the company, while the two main shareholders at SABMiller are the cigarette manufacturer Altria (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, Altria refused to make statements about the fact that they were addressed by AB InBev, but on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said at an analysis conference that regularly evaluates investment in SABMiller and that "this time we consider the maintenance of assets to be in the interest of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, head of European investment, equity, at the Alliance Global Investors, which holds shares in both companies, says that AB InBev has faced increasing pressure to return the excess cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of low-debt income is about 15%.
But we believe that the profit obtained from this purchase would be a disappointing 8% after 10 years," Dwane said.
In the case of any combination there are significant weights related to the infringement of competition rules, in particular in the United States, where companies hold around 70% of the beer market.
"The economies that could be done to distribution operations are large and the costs of violating competition rules are even greater," said Erik Gordon, professor at the Ross Business School at the University of Michigan.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain 58 percent of the company's shareholdings held by SABMiller in accordance with the operating agreement governing it.
A change of control to SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to obtain another 8 percent and to appoint a new executive director of the company.
Molson, with a headquarters in Denver, would have the right to the first and last bids for the rest of 50 percent.
A spokesperson for Molson refused to comment on whether the company was interested in an invitation to tender, but Molson's shares grew by more than 12 percent, at their highest value.
Any merger could also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is the association in the participation of CR Snow of SABMiller with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that the combined group could have a 28% share of the global market.
AB InBev is advised by Lazard, and SABMiller is advised by Robey Warsaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accuse a former Air Force pilot of helping Qaeda
Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who would have been donated further funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, police officers reported Wednesday for Reuters, in a rare case aimed at those who support financial activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern town of Karachi.
He paid for the treatment of wounded Taliban militants at a hospital in the eastern town of Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two militants involved in a month-long attack on a bus with members of the Muslim minority and Ishmaelian, who killed 45 people, reported to journalists the senior police officer Naved Khawaja from the Department for Combating Terrorism of the province.
It will be accused of financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has more funded the Afghan Taliban, we are still doing research to see if he has provided financial assistance through his business or behind him is someone else," the officer said.
"Ahmed has also provided financial assistance for AQIS," he said, referring to Al Qaeda's organization on the Indian Subcontinent, a branch of Al Qaeda founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for the Pakistani police force, which is faced with activism, corruption and murder.
After the Taliban gunmen massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school in December, the government swore to undermine its activity.
There have been severe attacks, while the army has also gone further in the tribal regions outside the border with Afghanistan.
But the military groups remain a threat, and many of them have access to Pakistani cities that are under the control of very poorly prepared police forces and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, 52 years old, used to hold sermons at a mosque in a good area of the Karachi Army Housing Authority.
His public sermons were moderate, but in particular he encouraged radicalism, policemen said.
He studied at the Pakistani Air Force College in Sargodha and left Pakistani Air Force in 1998, another security officer for Reuters under anonymity.
He later joined the vampires and chemicals industry.
Rapper Rick Ross has rejected his application for copyright for "Everyday I'm Hustlin"
New York Rapper Rick Ross cannot claim copyright for the words "Everyday I'm Hustlin'," a U.S. judge ruled by rejecting his complaint against the music group LMFAO, who sold tricks with a similar version, "Everyday I'm shufflin'".
In a decision published on Tuesday by the Federal Court of Miami, District Judge Kathleen Williams said Ross's slogan, the prominent part of his initial hit since 2006, "Hustlin'", is a short expression for which the courts have mentioned several times that they cannot receive copyright.
Williams' ruling weakens the process of violating the copyright that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, tried against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the Los Angeles electropist, built by Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin'" for their famous 2010 song "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shufflin'".
The hip hop star said the LMFAO song is "a clear attempt to capitalize on the fame and success of the Hustlin song".
He also gave Kia Motors trial for using the song "Party Rock Anthem" in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright, selling shirts and other products with the shufflin' slogan.
In Tuesday's ruling, Williams says "Hustlin'", as a melody, is protected by copyright law.
But Ross's three-word slogan is composed of ordinary words and cannot be copyrighted, she said.
The judge compared it to other famous versions of music from the past, such as "you get the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it poppin'", saying it is "a short expression, which all the courts unanimously declared it impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the song of the LMFAO team is an unauthorized copy of Hustlin's.
The process is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO's lawyers could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al, at the U.S. District Court for Southern District, Florida, No.

Dr. Carson approaches Trump in the most recent presidential poll of the Republican Party
According to the latest presidential poll for 2016, news politician Ben Carson is approaching bomb leader Donald Trump in the Republican preliminary elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped in seven-point surveys.
After supporting 27% of Trump in the most recent CBS/New York Times survey, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, reaches the second place with 23 percent, followed by Bush, television screened Mike Huckabee, Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, each with 6%.
Support from Republican voters in the preliminary elections increased from early August to early September for Trump, Carson, the governor of Ohio John Kasich, and Hewlett Packard's former executive director, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two remains, however, to numbers one.
Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and the one leading the Bush family standards, dropped by seven percentage points in one month, while Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker dropped by eight points.
In the last survey, Walker's support is 2%.
Carson attracted more support than Trump among college graduates (29% vs 21%), while Trump was ahead of Carson in the preferences of the non-university voters (30% vs 19%).
Trump is supported by more men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the survey said they are determined what the candidate supports in the preliminary elections in their state.
Those who said they knew who would vote with them twice as much support Trump as Carson.
It is still too early to say for 63% of the Republican voters for the preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT survey conducted between 9 and 13 September will be made public on Tuesday, before a presidential debate in the Republic.
Carson's rise in this survey reflects Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders's position in front of the leader for the nomination of the presidential democrats, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The latest follow-up to CBS presidential nominations shows that Sanders has climbed 10 points and 22 points in Iowa, respectively in New Hampshire, among the democratic voters for the preliminary.
A leading ethics specialist says that sexual robots should be banned
A leading ethics specialist in the robotics industry launched a campaign in which sexual robots are required to be banned.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, a robotic expert at the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic detachment of women and children.
"Sex robots seem to be an increasingly important subject in the robotics industry, and the models from which they are inspired - the way they will show, what roles they will have - are very disturbing," she told the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sexual robots is not one against sex but against exploitation.
Technology isn't neutral.
It is inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires technology development," she said to Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will contribute to increasing the degree of sexual exploitation.
Although sexual robots that are now being manufactured are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that they are the first step towards something worse.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we have to stop it from happening.
The industry certainly seems to be scared.
A few years ago, True Companion, a company producing inflatable dolls, launched Roxxxy, "the first sex robot in the world".
However, concern about the potential dangers posed by artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among the major industry representatives.
Even this spring, the executive director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk of a truly dangerous event in five years.
In an interview given to the BBC last December, physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that "the development of a complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race".
Britain takes the first refugees from Syria - RT UK
The following days, Britain will receive the first refugees who have fled the Syrian war, Interior Minister Theresa May announced.
They will receive assistance under the extensive re-installation programme of the government.
Refugees seeking asylum arrive from camps at the border with war-torn country.
They are the first of the 20,000 refugees the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Interior Minister said the government "works fast" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, it is imperative that the assistance and support they need and deserve are already being developed.
I know that the honourable members and the general public want to know more about the number of persons and the date on which they are expected to arrive.
May mentioned that the government must also make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate provisions when they arrive.
I need to stress that the level of expansion requires careful and thorough planning to ensure that everything is being done properly.
Me and the Syrian refugee minister Richard Harrington, we will continue to keep the camera up to date in this regard.
But I am pleased to tell the House that we expect the first wave of refugees to take place in the next few days and we are working fast to plan more arrivals in the coming weeks.
Prime Minister David Cameron drew the wrath of parliamentarians and militants when he revealed the plan for government refugees, many thinking that the figure was too small.
In September, Cameron told the House of Commons that the United Kingdom "will rise to the height of its moral responsibility" and receive 20,000 refugees from the camps in the Middle East until the next general election.
He added that refugees will not automatically receive full asylum, but a humanitarian status that will allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
Critics observed, however, that the figures meant only 12 refugees per day, and the former liberal democratic parliamentary Paddy Ashdown said the measures were "desolates".
Further, Ashdown has revealed that children included in this scheme will be deported when they are 18 years old if they do not receive asylum.
See also important public figures condemned the measures in turn.
In a common letter, great names such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said the response to the crisis was "too little too late".
"It is a responsibility to be shared with our European neighbours, not simply thrown on the shoulders of the countries close to the conflicts that take people away from their homes," they wrote.
Rubla Retires on Global Insecurity Fund - RT Business
The Russian Rubla was strengthened on Wednesday, trading with 65.66 against the US dollar and 73.98 against the euro at the Moscow Bursa at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percent of its lowest rate of 71 rubles for a dollar on 24 August.
Analysts say the return of rubles was due to the investor reaction to the current global market disturbances caused by China’s weights, the potential increase in the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate and the excessive reaction to cheap oil.
Brent's quotas grew by 61 cents on Wednesday, reaching 48.36 USD per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 cents more, at USD 45.31 per barrel.
MULT CHALLENGES: Most likely, the interest rate will increase in the United States by the end of 2015 - US Fed
"It is possible that volatility can say the word, fuelled by uncertainty about China and by the increase in federal interest rate, which will continue to give a tone for oil and rubble prices," said Bloomberg Piotr Matys from Rabobank, an expert on monetary policies in emerging markets, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the strengthening of the Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, started to buy rubles.
The global markets are waiting with the soul of the mouth for the Federal Reserve's decision on Thursday, whether it will increase or not.
The markets consider that what could be the first growth in the US interest rate in nine years and traded at higher rates on Wednesday.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together on the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the US government and with companies such as Google, Amazon and the Verizon telephone company to develop a database that allows drone pilots to reserve airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
The collaboration comes as a result of a very widespread unrest regarding the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes the potential negative effect in live colours.
"Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or catching data in urban areas with high density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco," the research states.
Without a common set of technological protocols and air rules, chaos could be installed.
According to Heit O'Cathain, Baroness of the Chamber of Lords, concern has grown on the basis of events reports on the limit of production of an accident and drone operation over football stadiums near nuclear power stations and Eiffel Tower.
"In the last two years, over 400 calls to the metropolitan police have been linked to drone incidents," O'Cathain said.
Which is the solution: to build a system that follows all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 metres, whether driven by commercial or amateur pilots.
"As many small drones operate commercial flights at low altitude, beyond the pilot's visibility level, or even fully autonomous flights, there is a need for some air traffic management infrastructure to separate flights, in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, such as the delivery of trains in cities," she said.
According to NASA, this drone traffic management system will include services such as air space design, methods to avoid unfavourable weather conditions and wind, congestion management, route planning and redirection by similar methods to the rules established for road traffic, such as signalling and tires.
They are expected to have a functional prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is going to explode in the European Union in the coming years.
"We already see small and innovative SMEs in the United Kingdom using this technology with significant effects in the energy, agriculture and the media industries," says Lord Tariq.
More than 670 licences for commercial drone operations were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission considers that the drone industry could generate 150,000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Dislike button: why does Facebook want to know what's bothering you?
"A Look Back" works similarly, gathering the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will this mean for many users inside the virtual Facebook borders, who are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, an empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge value of Facebook - about 240 billion USD after the latest statistics - is due to the unimaginable amount of data about consumers it holds.
Every interaction, postage, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered and build a remarkable picture of a complex, located in a permanent update, about your person and the preferences you have.
This is especially valuable for advertising agents, who can use all this information to choose carefully what people see on Facebook ads, selecting those who are most interested in their products.
An empathy button adds another set of data and certainly opens a door for another type of advertising agent using the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who "appreciate" a national football team, charitable organisations and promoters want to address those who, for example, "compathize" with the refugee crisis.
It will also probably change what you see at News.
Facebook uses incredible intelligent and sophisticated algorithms to restrict that vast universe of content that you can see in the smaller stream that you actually see.
This algorithm depends essentially on what you considered interesting in the past and, above all, what you liked.
There is no doubt that there is fear on Facebook that many interesting but unhappy posts do not enter the algorithm, because people do not feel that they should appreciate it.
However, if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it could decide to remove this kind of posts from News.
Facebook has conducted experiments in the past to understand how what you see in News affects your emotional state and, above all, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
Academic environment representatives call this "emotional contamination" and, although it sounds bad, it is probably just a simple attempt on Facebook (and published, with their agreement) to better understand how their platform works and whether they can adjust the algorithms to distribute multiple elements.
What happens to the empathy button remains on Facebook width.
The thing that's really exciting is how a single company's decision to add one button to its services can produce so many speculations.
The reason why this happens may be that the decisions made by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons that we see or the invisible algorithms that work hidden - have profound consequences for us today.
Now we spend a significant part of our life in the digital world, which we access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another that is leading a constant struggle for survival in the fierce Darwinian world of technology and social networks.
Decisions taken, including with regard to new buttons, will be considered the most appropriate to remain on the ground in this race.
I think a lot of people can empathize with this and they'll soon have a button for this.
Biometric arms can anticipate crises in people with autism
In the course of ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team have established that body signals can anticipate such changes, sometimes violent, before they occur, giving assistants the opportunity to take appropriate measures.
The autism kids we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say he's having a headache or that "there's too much noise here" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body transmits to us, and we need to do this in a soft and intrusive way.
For example, simple color visualization in an application can show the level of agitation. The red can be used to warn about behavioral changes, and blue for lack of interest, giving it to the assistant that the person is bored and needs to be stimulated.
Data from bracelets can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping caregivers to understand the overall picture of how the person responds to various situations and which would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to say very clearly that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magic. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with producers to further develop this technology, to be specific for autism.
The research was evaluated by Jane Carolan, director of services for customers from the Wirral Austic Society, who will present technology at the Autech 2015 conference on autism and technology from Manchester on 1 October.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we do, you see the spectacular difference that can lead to their life's quality of assistance technology. Now, the iPad applications give a voice to people who have never spoken.
The robots help autistic children learn to play to hide your face.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistance technologies can really change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charity for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and they are also part of the discussion of how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria "in the coming weeks"
In the following weeks, French warplanes will launch air attacks on the targets of Isis in Syria, the government announced on Wednesday, just days after President François Holland said the intervention was a "necessary".
France will launch the first air attacks on the jihadist group Islamic State in Syria "in the coming weeks", Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday.
French air forces are conducting reconnaissance missions in Syria on 8 September, and the attacks will follow "in the coming weeks as soon as we have clearly identified targets," Le Drian said for France Inter's radio station.
Le Drian said Tuesday in parliament that the Islamic state has made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern region of Aleppo.
"In the city of Mare there is an extremely strong offensive, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian national coalition or what remains of it," he said.
France is part of a US-led coalition that for one year bombed the Isis positions in Iraq, but the Netherlands changed its strategy last week to extend the actions in Syria, under conditions in which political pressure accumulates on the ground of the jihadist threat facing France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf have already been involved in attacks on Isis militants in Syria.
The blocking feature of iOS 9 ads will make the phone even faster
The newest version of iOS 9 is launched on Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and caring for online publishers - is the ability to easily block ads while browsing the web.
The new feature will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, advertisements, pop-up windows and other advertising types while using the Safari mobile browser version from Apple.
In the tests, it has been found that after blocking the ads, news sites such as the New York Times load twice as fast, according to Reuters.
The blocking of advertisements also helps users to retain the use of data and the autonomy of the battery.
Users will benefit from multiple advertising blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blocker and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular tool for blocking desktop ads, has launched its own iOS web browser that limits ads; its creator intends to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
Individuals using advertising blocking software happen to have a few constraints.
The ads are still displayed in applications (from here Apple wins money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent their visitors from using such features as blocking ads.
However, their use on desktop computers increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
The development of these huge challenges for online media, which is largely offered to consumers free of charge and is supported financially for many years by advertising.
One report says that blocking ads could cost online publishers nearly 22 billion in revenue generated from advertising only this year.
To enable blocking of ads in iOS 9, users need to download an application for blocking ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to activate an extension for blocking content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama happened on Tuesday to King Felipe VI of Spain at the White House, where the two discussed various issues, but probably reduced to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the king have addressed the issue of the fight against the Islamic State and the growing crisis of immigrants in Europe - who are already facing hundreds of thousands of people who have left their country of origin to go west.
"Spain has tried very hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous travel, and the problem of trafficking in persons," Obama said.
Of course, the problem has worsened in the last few months.
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, especially in the context where the Spanish territory of Catalonia will vote in the elections that will take place this month.
"As regards foreign policy, we have firmly committed ourselves to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The Supreme Commander has already told King Felipe that he would like to visit the country before the end of his term of office in 2017.
"We receive you with open arms," said Philip.
First lady, Michelle Obama, made a tour of the White House to the queen and had a tea discussion.
That was the first visit of the royal couple to the United States of America from the throne.
After they left Washington, they were about to make a visit to South Florida.
Alfred Woodard joins the Luke Cage series team
Famous actress Alfred Woodard joined the future distribution of the Netflix Luke Cage series by Marvel. He will be an antagonist of Mike Colter, who plays the role of the superhero who gives the title of the series.
Woodard will play the role of Mariah Dillard - "a local politician in Harlem and the cousin of Cornell "Cottonmouth" Stokes recently announced, played by Mahershala Ali - who intends to bring a era of change on the streets he has grown up", says a press release.
Her personal life and career are given over to her by Harlem's newest hero, Luke Cage, but also by her cousin's infamous actions, Cottonmouth.
"Alfre has an incredible, unique and frightening presence on the screen, which makes it perfect for the role of the leader of the Harlem community," says Jeff Loeb, executive producer and President Marvel Television.
We are delighted that an actress as famous and talented as Alfre has agreed to join us in this adventure.
The series will be the first in 2016.
Cheo Hodari Cocker will write the first two episodes and work as a showrunner and executive producer.

Luke Cage is one of the four Marvel series of Netflix French.
Jessica Jones and Iron Fist will soon be broadcast, but also the second season of Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empire" have the world first on the same day
Fox foresees many positive results before the first two of his most expected series: Scream Queens and Empire.
The first season of Queens and the second of the Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels one day after the internal premiere.
According to Variety, the strategy is a trend applied to high profile series, as global social network traffic guarantees success.
"Hollywood realizes how important it is to value the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for the series that is very much discussed, such as Empire and Scream Queens," said Fox International channel president Hernan Lopez, according to Deadline.
"We are just waiting to broadcast these very interesting series to fans from around the world," Lopez continued.
The viewers we serve every day bring the success of a series to the premiere and throughout his life cycle.
The next season in the Empire, in which they will play famous sights such as Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, has the first in September.
The new Scream Queens series, in which Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande will play, will be broadcast the second day in September.
Members of the British royal family will participate in the world premiere of the "Spectre"
Prince Harry and dukes and dukes of Cambridge will take part next month in London's world premiere of the most recent James Bond film, "Spectre".
The Kensington Palace announced the news on Twitter on Wednesday, appointing the premiere as the Royal Film Performance for Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a press release by the producers, "Spectre" is the third Bond film selected as the 1946 RFP.
In the past, for the first kings were selected and "Don't Die Today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year's event takes place on October 26th. at the Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a charity, which will result in employees from British film and television collections.
The premiere will also be attended by actors from the film distribution, including the lead actor Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishow, Naomi Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
Director Sam Mendes and manufacturers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will also go on the red carpet with members of the royal family.
"Spectre" will be broadcast to US cinematographers in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
The Christie Brinkley and the musician John Mellencamp were seen taking dinner together on Mondays, shouting that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at the Bowery Hotel in New York City, where the photos surprised Brinkley with joy and smile.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing blouses, tennis and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in broken blouses, coat and boots.
Last year, in October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his lover who is separated and who is constantly at peace with, the actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the message star for you at Today's NBC, saying it was "an angel that was sent to me and I am very happy".
He added that "nothing shall end until it is finished".
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Brinkley Cook, took pictures of Seventeen magazine, walking through her mother's tracks.
The arctic tanning lines are large enough to attract a caribulean
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable because of the warmer climate, but global warming has proved to be a blessing to others.
One of these advantaged species is the Arctic herb.
According to researchers from Dartmouth College, the warmest temperatures in the Arctic region have allowed herbaceans to appear earlier and grow larger, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers from the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their observations in the field to exemplify the effects of temperature changes on Arctic landings.
Their analysis anticipates an increase of 50% of adult pregnancy survival rate in terms of 2 degrees Celsius.
These are small, but they are important members of the Arctic trophic chain and of the ecosystem.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in Procedures of the Royal Society B - aims to help biology better anticipate how a growing fertilization population could affect the species with which they feed, the birds and insects that they feed, and the plants that they pollinate.
In order to build their demonstration, scientists from Dartmouth combined their field results with the results of laboratory experiments that researched how temperature influences insect development and the willingness to be hunted by predators.
Although the increase in temperature makes the greater pregnant women more vulnerable to coleopters, it also provides them with an early start in the spring and makes the development of their larvae more rapid and efficient, which certainly represents an advantage.
More pregnancy means a larger population, which can only be developed to the extent that I can support the food sources of insects.
The ability of pregnant women to turn their improved survival rate into an improved breeding rate depends on their ability to provide their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies have shown that the administration of antidepressants to pregnant women has no effect on the neuronal or behavioral development of their children.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin recovery inhibitors (SSRIs) are at increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have said that depression is a higher risk for women and children, and therefore should be treated.
"These studies add a growing set of evidence for the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy," said John Thorp in a press release, the deputy editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, so far the evidence seems to show that the risks of untreated depression are higher than those raised by the administration of antidepressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health has coordinated a study on the development of children whose mothers have been treated with SSRI, analysing the data of 51 404 children from the Norwegian Mother and Child cohort study, examining the effects of using SSRI for the development of engine capacity at the age of 3.
Researchers have found that 381 mothers used SSRI during pregnancy, and 159 of these have been treated with drugs for an extended period.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in engine development, researchers wrote in the study that the association "was not so significant as to give the latter a clinical significance".
A group of researchers from the Adelaide University of Australia conducted a data review for 49,000 Danish birth cohort women to discover the effects of SSRI administration on the behavior of children under 7 years of age.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
In 210 of the children whose mothers had been treated with SSRI depression, there was no increased risk of behavioral problems compared to the 231 children who were more prone to behavioral problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more predisposed to bleeding after birth if treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who were born to a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal bleeding increased by 5%, between 11 and 16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers reported.
Researchers said that although the study linked the administration of SSRI with increased risk, there are a large number of variables - from medications taken during birth to the limited amount of information that researchers have on the specific medical conditions of women - that could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
"It is possible that women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced stage of pregnancy were those with the most serious stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal bleeding, not antidepressants," says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at Adelaide University.
On the basis of this study, we do not recommend that women stop treatment for depression during pregnancy but should be closely monitored to minimise the risk of potential bleeding.
Matthew is charged with murder in the case of the murder of a student at Virginia Technical University
The man charged with the murder of Hannah Graham from the University of Virginia was charged with the murder of a student from the University of Virginia who disappeared in 2009, the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The great jury in Albemarle, Virginia, accused Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. of killing Morgan Harrington at the age of 33 from Charlottesville, officials say.
Matthew is also charged with kidnapping with the intention of rape.
Each head of charge receives the maximum sentence of imprisonment in life.
Harrington, aged 20, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the news of the charges has brought them relief.
"For six years we have been working resolutely and resolutely for this purpose," says Morgan's mother, Gil Harrington.
I'm glad to know that when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences for your life.
For Jesse Matthew, the dominoes of the consequences began to sit down.
Police say there is a medical-legal link between Harrington, Graham and a 2005 sexual abuse in Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty of this and awaits sentence in this case.
Stay in prison in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew accused of murder in the case of the death of a student at the University of Virginia
Harrington went to U-Va. on October 17, 2009 together with his friends at a Metallica concert.
The group separated when Harrington left John Paul Jones Arena from Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't get back.
Last time she was seen trying to take a taxi around 8:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was dressed in a black shirt with Pantera.
After her disappearance, Harrington's luggage and mobile phone were found in the arena parking lot.
The family and friends began an extensive search of Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a teacher. The Metallica people wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the dress he wore was found next to an apartment atmosphere in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated chain, in a farm south-west of Charlottesville.
In the period of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it's not clear if that period coincided with the date that Harrington disappeared.
Police say a significant advance in the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the event of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said these cases were related to DNA evidence.
The investigators did not immediately publish the details of the new evidence that they decided to put Matthew in charge of Harrington's murder.
Defence lawyer Douglas Ramseur, representing Matthew in Graham's case, refused to make statements.
The notice of the indictment comes two days after the execution of one year after Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both were young students who disappeared when they left town in Charlottesville.
Graham, aged 18, from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a mall near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later, after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the early days after Graham's disappearance last autumn in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at meetings and sights for the missing student from U-Va.
Harrington says he has endured for her daughter speculation and criticism in the media that must be reduced to silence by the new heads of prosecution against Matthew.
"At all this time there have been discussions of the kind "Why did she wear a short skirt?" and "And she's looking for a candle?" but this kind of questions and judgment are not valid when it's clear that we have to deal with a predator after hunting," Harrington added.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was sentenced to sexual assault on a youth in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 at the time of the attack, told the jury that on a September night, while she was returning home from the store, a stranger came behind her.
She took her to a back zone, beat her and strangled her neck, then attacked her sexually.
"I thought it was over, that I had to keep screaming," the woman confessed.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew took a sudden run, said the woman.
A prosecutor told the jury that Matthew might have been afraid of the lights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was sentenced years later, after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew will receive his sentence in October.
Matthew will come to trial for the first time in the Harrington case in Charlottesville on Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said the most likely to come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"At least, today I've taken a step," says Dan Harrington.

Actor Kit Harington gives us an indication

Let's just say that the show will be part of my life for a while, I'll probably be over 30 when it's over.
But one thing is certain.
"When I leave the Games of Thrones, there will be a time when I will join long-term film projects," the actor said.
The show comes back to the small screens in the spring of next year.

Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to renew payments for Romania under the "Economic Competitiveness" and "Media" programmes, both interrupted at the beginning of April 2015.
According to a Communication from the Representative of Romania of the European Commission, following this Decision, around 120 million euros will be transferred to the Romanian authorities in the next period.
I am pleased to announce the unlocking of these payments and I appreciate the efforts made by the Roman authorities to improve the management and control systems of the two programmes.
It is important that the Roman authorities have been involved in identifying weak points and solving problems.
"I hope that the measures taken will significantly reduce the risk of future errors and irregularities," said European Commissioner for Regional Policy Corina Cretu.
"The extremist statements made by Mr Gianni Pitella are incorrect," the chief of the Hungarian diplomacy responded.
Peter Szijarto asked European Socialists to stop "the campaign of lies" to Hungary.
Referring to the statements made by Harlem Desire, the French Secretary of State for European Affairs, on Hungary's built-in fence, Szijjarto stressed that Budapest "supports a common European strategy on immigration", however insisting that national borders should be protected.

"We want two victories, with the teams of Canada and Italy," said Mihai Macovei, captain of Romania.

The refugee crisis: JAI has no solution
European Council President Donald Tusk announced that Thursday will take a decision on the possible convening of a European Union Summit on Migration in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann asked Tuesday to organise a European Union summit to resolve the refugee crisis.
At a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot manage the refugee crisis alone.
The German executive chief expressed his support for the recent decision taken by Berlin to impose border controls on the massive flow of asylum seekers, mentioning that the measure aims to facilitate the registration of refugees.
On the other hand, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposals for the redeployment of refugees between Member States on the basis of mandatory quotas - has decided to organise an extraordinary EU summit.
The EU Interior Ministers, meeting Monday evening in Brussels, failed to adopt the new proposal to redeploy 120,000 refugees among the Member States of the European Union, presented on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first point of the plan, represented by the refugee resettlement mechanism, provides for the rapid redeployment of 54,000 refugees located in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, our controversial cartoons
French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo once again provokes controversy, after publishing cartoons that undermine the response of the predominantly Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants from the Muslim predominant territories affected by war.
In the most recent number of or, the publication has drawn attention again, as well as critics on social networks, the agency Reuters writes.
One of the drawings highlights a fascinating image of Aylan Kurdi, the Syrian man who was killed, whose body arrived on one of the beaches of Turkey, after an unsuccessful attempt to cross the sea by boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
Charlie Hebdo's drawing looks like a kid in short pants and shirts, with face down on the big ass, next to a billboard offering two menus for kids at the price of one.
"So near to succeed," is the message that follows the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack from the Paris editorial headquarters in January, is accompanied by the message "Dovada that Europe is Christian".
The drawing presents a character like Jesus, who goes to the water, while a smaller person wears short pants with his feet up in the water, first saying "Christians go to the water", takes the second "Muslim children get angry".
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression after an attack by Islamic militants in January as a result of repeated threats after the prophet Muhammad's beating.
A chain of supermarkets present in Romania, drastically threatened in Russia
The French supermarket chain Auchan has been threatened with over $370,000 by Russian officials, being accused of undermining food security.
Anna Popova, head of the Russian Consumer Protection Agency Rosprenadzor, said that the fines totalise over 25 million rubles, i.e. $372.000, is related to the Associated Press agency, quoted by US News.
However, the reasons for these amendments were not specified, and Auchan did not comment.
The French supermarket chain is also the ink of the Russian Agriculture Agency's accusations, which argues that some meat products have been found to be infected with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come within a period of tension between France and Russia on the issue of the extension of European Union sanctions and France's decision to withdraw an understanding of the supply of Russia's Mistral ship.
The Roman Ministry of Foreign Affairs has responded to the news that Hungary could raise a metallic fence at the border with our country.
MAE appears to have been briefed on this decision and that it is not a political gesture.
MAE shows, in a communication submitted to Ziare.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention shortly before it was announced to the public.
On the other hand, the MAE informed the relevant decision-making factors in Romania in relation to this situation in good time.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a fence between two Member States of the European Union and which are strategic partners is not a right political gesture, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian party, it appears in the communication.
Hungary plans to build a metallic fence on a border segment with Romania, in the context of the immigration crisis, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Tuesday, quoted by Mediafax.
"The measure is necessary for the trafficking of persons transiting Serbia to change its routes, there is a likelihood of heading towards Romania," the Hungarian diplomat's chief explained.
"The Guard would begin from the point of border between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue at a reasonable distance if the pressure of migration shifts to Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants crossing the Serbian territory on their way to the European Union were trying to circumvent the fence built by the Hungarian authorities through its eastern head, at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have discovered that they can cool the fence through the Majdan/Rade area (Serbia) - Baba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
Hungary's government has allocated 22.2 billion forts (EUR 71.8 million) to build a controversial metallic fence at the border with Serbia, at a distance of 175 kilometres, and for special centres needed to accommodate immigrants.
The Guard initiative is criticised by the European Union and Serbia.
No need, he'll stay there.
The letter of Cornelius Vadim Tudor's uninstituted body will not be deposited in the Senate of Romania, despite the wish in this sense exprinated by the politician's widow.
According to a communiqué submitted by Ziare.com, the Senate's Permanent Bureau took up a request on Tuesday by Mr. Vadim Tudor on the approval of the uninstituted body of former Senator Cornelius Vadim Tudor at the Senate headquarters.
"From receipt of this letter until the time of analysis, in the Permanent Bureau, the uninsured body has already been deposited at a cult lake and will remain there, the Permanent Bureau considering that it is no longer necessary to be moved from there to the Senate of Romania," the Senate reports.
Senator PNL Teodor Atanasiu argued that this request "is not in line with Romania's geographical position somewhere in Europe".
Also transmitting Agerpres, the senators held a moment of recollection in memory of former PRM leader, at the proposal of UNPR Senator Serb Mihailescu.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died, Monday night, around 6:30 p.m.
The president of the PRM went to the Army's Emergency Medical Center for Cardiovascular Diseases.
The European Parliament will be buried on Thursday, from 12:00, at the Ghencea Cemetery, and will be part of military honors.
Are the refugees coming to Romania?
Homes of granite, questions about accommodation
The first members of the Arad Jud border areas are questioned by the Border Police and Police in these days about accommodation for refugees who could reach Romania, but also for Jandarmi, where they will be mobilized at the border.
The town of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on this subject.
Discussions were conducted with farmers in the area, and they were asked to report on the presence of any foreigners near the border.
I had discussions with the border police, the national police and the local police, but also with farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant in the next period.
"I have asked farmers, who have worked in this period on Arab lands, to be attentive and report any movement," said Edel.
The crisis of immigrants gives in to the bellows in Hungary: Blinds and water to the granite
He, like other mayors in the border area with Hungary, said that the police had requested information about the accommodation available in the case of a refugee wave.
We were asked how many people we can file.
We don't have room for refugees in the community.
We believe that such special centres must not even appear at the border, because they are more difficult to control here, migrants are tempted to flee, because they are not interested in staying in Romania.
It would be best to set up such centres in areas more remote from the border," said Iratosu, Mayor of the Irátosu municipality, Papp Atila Iosif.
On the other hand, the mayor of the Dorobanti municipality, Vincentu Almasi, said that he had been asked about accommodation for both refugees and the intervention forces in case they were mobilized in the area.
The police were wondering if we could handle the case.
We could find places on the Cultural Road, but for refugees we have no possibility of accommodation.
"We have been asked about the length of the border with Hungary, probably working on an action plan," Vincentum Almasi said.
He added that at the local police station, "beginning on Tuesday, since Hungary has sealed its border with Serbia, it has been established permanently".
"There's always a police officer at work, and the locals know they have to inform if they notice any stranger in the area," the Edel said.
Primaria Pilu's representatives said that they can accommodate at least one hundred people on the Cultural Path, providing information to the police at their request.
The mayor of the town of Curtis, Nicolae Aanite, also said that there is room for accommodation in the former local public finance office, but there is a need for repairs.
A former Border Police barracks could also be threatened to host refugees.
The representatives of the Arad Police Press Office did not offer an opinion on the question of the mayors during this period, only confirming that "the patrol activities were intensified in the border areas of Arad.
Commander of the Army Club announced radical measures against the Becali Star
Commander of the Army's Sports Club, Colonel George Boroi, announced a series of radical measures to be taken against Gigi Becali's Star.
Even though the two parties have negotiated an impasse, Boroi argues that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historical palmares of the "ros-albsters".
The team that won the Champions Cup is on the break now.
"It's not a historic break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have a team, but things can change from next year," Boroi said to Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announced that the process of requesting damage from the Becali team would continue.
The period to which we refer by decision of the ICCJ is set out very clearly.
We had to recover the damage from the Staraua FC, the team that used the Staraua brand without the owner's acceptance - i.e. CSA Staraua.
It also appears very clearly the continuity of the section, which was actually permanent at the Army Club.
"So the Bucharest Star football team, in one form or another, but in another legal form, must exist as a continuation of the trainers they have so far in palmares," said George Boroi.
Becali's star and the Army Club are in open war since the end of last year, when the Supreme Court has decided that the military are the ones holding the "Star".

The region that "colcays" millionaires
Millions from Asia-Pacific will be forming this year the group of the richest people in the world, thanks to the accumulated resources in China and India, showing a study published on Wednesday by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management.
According to this document, in 2015, the accumulated assets of millions in Asia Pacific will exceed the total of $15,800 billion registered in 2014, as well as the assets of millions in North America, which currently represent the richest people in the world, with a accumulated assets of $16,200 billion, AFP.
The study states that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very rich people, named in the High Net Worth Individuals financial jargon, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, compared to 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are the people who can invest at least one million dollars, regardless of the value of the property and other properties.
"In the future, HNWI wealth is expected to create more in Asia Pacific than in any other region of the world, most of the new assets are expected to come from emerging economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand," says the study by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management.
The report estimates that China and India account for almost 10% of HNWI's global assets and are responsible for 17% of the global growth of new assets after 2006.
China, the world's second economy after the US, had a total of 890,000 million dollars in 2014 with an accumulated $4,500 billion in growth of 17.5%, respectively, 19.3%, compared to 2013.
On either side, India has the fastest rate of growth of the number of millionaires, 26.3%, up to 198.000 people, while their accumulated wealth increased by 28.2%, up to $785 billion.
"Dorel" mounted the reverse camouflage
At Suceava, the workers mounted a six-footed semafort so instead of being inspired to wait four seconds, the passersby get the "h" message, which I don't know how to decrypt.
Don't worry, no matter how everyone goes through the red, informs the truth.
Everyone's going through how he cuts his head.
Two guys were to be taken up by a car because they went through the red.
"The Rutier politicians should be here to help, until the world gets used to it," said a woman to the quoted source.
The Semaforl was recently mounted in front of Piete Mari in the center of Suceve, but passersby seem not willing to take it into account, as much as the information received seems to be incomprehensible.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of a 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" did his job properly and someone was responsible enough to give you the ok to finish the job, then it would not have arrived in this absurd situation.
The Head of Administration Strazi and Systematization Road Service in the Suceava Primary recognizes that he was a girl when the traffic light started to work, but didn't realize that something was wrong.
We put them in use, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"Even I was the girl when they were put into service," said Stefan Vasincu, promising that the problem would be remedied in the shortest time.
Thank God it can be remedied, because it is the situations in which "Dorel" has made the ravages irreparable.
For example, when he worked at the Giurgiu-Ruse pipeline, "Dorel" missed the drill that the tunnel was digging under the Danube, he did not know where, probably on the ground, the entropy, however it was not found, as even the Minister of Economy, Mihai Tudose, supported.
Police put the tunas with water on immigrants
At Hungary's main border with Serbia, Hungary's border was used on Wednesday, water and tear gas against immigrants.
Although Hungary has closed the border with a gimpata sarma fence and introduced harsh measures against illegal immigrants, including arrest, at the Serbian-Hungarian border, they have continued to gather refugees, writes The Guardian.
Water tunnels were put into operation when immigrants managed to penetrate through the sarma fence through the crossing point at the border of Roszke.
The Hungarian police argue that the action of the tuna was a multi-mile control measure, which throws water bottles.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some people are crying after the use of tear gas.
Elena Enikos's publication writes at the same time that two German companies refuse to deliver Hungary's gimpata scarma.
The country has already raised the fence to the border with Serbia and Tuesday announced its intention to raise one to the border with Romania, a strong initiative criticised in Bucharest.
German companies maintain that gimmata sarma is very dangerous and causes cuttings that can be infected.
It is used to secure military prisons or facilities, but it should not be used against people looking for adpost, supporting companies.
In parallel with the clashes at the Hungarian border, Croatia has mobilized to make it available to bus immigrants to transport those present at the country border with Serbia.
Croatian Interior Minister confirmed that buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to the reception centres.
373 people have entered Croatia from Serbia, of which 73 children, the Ministry has shown more.
Tsipras, on Greece's drama - why it agrees with the third agreement with the EU
The declared objective of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from increasing austerity and fundamentally change its relationship with the EU leadership in Brussels.
Finally, the leader of Syria made Greece part of a third loan agreement for this country, which also involves several years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, who is conducting an interview with it.
Now, however, Tsipras asks the Greeks to reinstate their prime minister's mandate in a election that he believes will take his political position.
Our goal was to reach an agreement, not an exit from the euro area or a break-out of the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, there remains the possibility of restructuring the debt for Greece," the former Prime Minister said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have been concluded in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
It is of the opinion that the financing part of the agreement is a great success for the elite government, indicating that all the country's financial needs are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras also says that Greece "is certainly in need of reform," stating that it must start with state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on 27 August, thus opening the way for early elections, in September, after 7 stormy months in front of the Athens Executive, during which a third saving loan was approved for Greece.

Activite from Star Trek, in prison because she was exposed to children
Activita Jennifer Lien, known as Star Trek, where she played for three seasons, intrudering Kes, was arrested for indecent exposure to children.
The incident that led her to prison, where she was from 3 September -- the search was set at $2,500 -- took place in front of her home in Tennessee.
The vide started to argue with a neighbor, Carey Smith, because of one of her crying children, Mirror reported.
At one point, during the dispute, the actress raised her shirt, pointing her butt, because then, before going into the house, she took off her pants.
When the police came, Jennifer refused to dress.
Moreover, it threatened to kill the police and was driven heavily to the car.
It's not the first time the 41-year-old actress has a problem with the police; in April, she was also arrested, then guilty even of the attack.
Jennifer went into the skin of Kes in 1995, after she appeared in American History X, where she also played Edward Norton.
He quit acting in 2002, when his first child was born.
She's married to the writer and film producer Phil Hwang.
They're taken in a Western mitralary.
Don't stand up to terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar Al Assad gave a rare interview to the Russian press, in which he talks about refugees and accuses the West of supporting terrorists and "in sight" immigrants.
"The West is crying for them and the West is supporting terrorists from the beginning of the crisis, when they said it was a passion revolution," Assad said in an interview given by Russia Today.
The leader of Damascus argues that his Western counterparts say that the situation in Syria is also a terrorist of the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president".
As long as this propaganda follows, there will be more refugees.
So it's not about Europe not accepting them or hugging them as refugees, it's about not treating the cause.
If you're worried about them, don't back the terrorists.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the core of all refugee issues," the Syrian leader added.
Assad continued the charges to the Western states and in relation to the treatment they show to the refugee girl.
It is like the West is now crying for refugees with one eye and taking them in sight with a second eye, because those refugees actually left Syria because of terrorism, in principle because of terrorists and crimes, and in the second round because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and destruction of infrastructure, you will not have the basic living resources, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to make up for their existence somewhere in this world," Bashar Al Assad says.
"If we were to ask any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family'," the Syrian president stressed, adding that political forces, whether inside or outside the government, 'should join around what the Syrian people want'.
The President of Syria is of the opinion that the country's dialogue should continue "to reach consensus", which cannot be implemented "only if we break up terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask all the forces to join against terrorism, because that is how we, as Syrians, can achieve the political goals we want through dialogue and political action," Bashar Al Assad said.
He also spoke about one of his country's allies, Russia's president Vladimir Putin, arguing that, in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, he was transformed, from a friend of the West, into his enemy.
Bashar al Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, again accusing the West of falsifying reality in both cases.
Notice what happened in the Western press after Ukraine hit.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a tar.
It is portrayed as a dictator who eliminates the opposition from Russia and who has reached power through non-democratic means, despite being elected in democratic elections, and the West itself has acknowledged that the elections have been democratic.
Now, I'm no longer democratic.
"This is Western propaganda," the leader of Damascus said.
Not least, it included Russia on the list of friendly countries - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, alongside Iran and Iraq, "because it faces the same type of terrorism".
Instead, Bashar al Assad criticised Turkey, another neighbouring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said that "I can't even make a move without first coordinating with the United States and other Western countries".
In addition, Syria's president accuses the "international coalition", led by the United States, who is fighting terrorism: "In fact, since this coalition began operating, the Islamic state has begun to expand".
In other words, the coalition has failed and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight terrorism.
You can't be with terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will understand you - then we have no objective to cooperate with all these countries, given that it is a real and non-false coalition, which fight against terrorism," said the leader of Damascus.
Toamna?
Not a word.

Maps of the countries with the largest savings and how Romania stands
The loss of the oil quota has led to great losses in the last year for workers in the extraction of the title, the shareholders of energy companies and countries that depend heavily on this resource.
But there is also a positive effect: gasoline has been very cheap.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that, in October 2014 - July 2015, in almost all 76 countries taken into account, the fuel price has decreased.
The most important reduction in the price of the pump is seen in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine cost 97%, so you can feed 24 SUVs with less than one dollar.
On the opposite pole is Saudi Arabia, where the price is kept fixed by the state.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the refining conditions, the changes in the tax, but also the fluctuations in the exchange rate.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price from each state into US dollars.
The situation in Romania
The Bloomberg data shows that in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of petrol (approximately 3.8 litres) was $5.49.
So, we're in place 27 on the edge of the countries with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this top position.
The last quarter of 2014, gas was also cheap to the Romans.
At the time, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a 10.6% price reduction.
Still, the roofs around are even better.
In Bulgaria, a gallon of gasoline costs $4.92, and in Hungary, $5.20.
The Germans put the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised Tuesday night that the federal government will provide additional support to the 16 countries of the federation in receiving and distributing tens of thousands of migrants entering the country through southern Europe.
After a meeting of nearly 4 hours with the prime ministers of the 16 federal states, Merkel said that "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to face the large number of refugees," the DPA agency notes.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial arrivals as well as distribution centres.
"There is a need for such pivot points," she stressed.
The whole country must provide a massive boost to face the crisis, Merkel added.
The country's premieres have called for more help than the 6 billion euros agreed by the ruling coalition at the federal level for more than a week.
Turkey's Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow from the Stanga Party asked for a "at least double, and for commitments, to be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister of the Rhine-Palatinate country, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into German society.
"We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also business, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also asked that bureaucracy in manipulating refugees and migrants be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed the processing in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
Until now, Bavaria has borne the most heavy burden, with the most migrants arriving after crossing the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a strong federal actor as head of the Crestin-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered into public conflict with Merkel after the chancellor announced a virtual policy of open doors at the beginning of the month, recalls DPA.
Mircea Lucescu makes a scandal after the humiliating breakup with Real Madrid
Mercea Lucescu was a nervous car at the end of the game with Real Madrid, which Sahtior Donetk lost with 0-4.
The Roman coach appeared totally disturbed by arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost his intruder was disadvantaged.
Before the game, I said one thing, that I want to be respected.
Unfortunately, in the battles with the important teams in Europe, we are always in favour of arbitration.
There are two totally different ways.
The new one gives us a yellow card right away, while the top teams don't.
Besides, the first penalty wasn't in any way!
The ball hit Darjio in the back without touching his hand.
A level-level game also should not be influenced by arbitration.
"Regreed that the arbitration has destroyed the game," Mircea Lucescu said at the press conference.
"Ma'am, but what smells so ugly here?"
They were broken by the broken husband
A murder of a sadism that came out of the commons terrified the residents of Targu Frumos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, in the early hours of the day, the markets in Trgu Frumos were able to see terrible scenes near the main market entry.
In addition to the three Tomberons, criminals have "assembled" what seemed to be a man's body.
It was torn apart, but it lacked its head, internal organs and genitals.
Finally, it was to prove that it was the body of a former officer who had been beaten by his wife, a geography teacher.
"The Day of Iaşi" has been talking to the police even with the taxi driver who helped the killer, without knowing, on the road to the sacks with the dead body.
His stories make your hair fly.
The one who alerted police yesterday about the fact that a woman whose three bags were smelling terrible, after you had been cut from the body found on the market, was a taxi driver from Targu Frumos.
As in American movies, the man himself helped carry bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, but without knowing, the killer was his client for a race.
The taxi driver told, exclusively for "The Day of Iaşi", the shocking scenes he went through, helping without wanting a killer to hide the evidence.
She carried with her hands the bag where the body parts of the professor of geography were located.
She came to Targu Beautiful to hide the evidence of the crime as far as her home from Rome.
Maybe he's got mine.
I had no idea.
Nea Mihai, as known by her friends who practice taximetry in Targu Beautiful, came to see over the night in the small town she lives in.
He saw American films throughout his life, but he never believed that he would ever catch himself who would be the basis for discovering a sad crime, and he would see with his eyes pieces of corpse.
It tells that, on the night of Monday to March, it usually expects the arrival of buses that regularly pass the locality.
It is near the intersection of the roads to Roman and Pascani.
The taxi driver tells that the killer woman noticed it in the rear-view mirror, next to the body parts supported by the indicator showing the nearby locations.
She came in the night with the Massaro race from 1.30.
The car left it ten meters from the crossing of pedestrians to Pascani, right on the edge where the traffic is shown.
The bags were cut off by the banner with the indicator.
After the bus left, I gave the marcher ten meters to her.
I opened the trunk and, after putting a bag, I asked, "Ma'am, what smells so bad here?"
I saw she's an old woman, and I told me to help her.
I thought it was going to market, undo, maybe it's got mine, I didn't have a way to know.
I thought maybe she wanted to fuck someone with that ugly, stinking meat.
She was trying to pick up a single bag, and I repeated to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"He specified me to take her to the big market door when I took her from the bus," he began to tell her Mihai.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He completed that the woman said absolutely nothing, and therefore he was no longer curious to ask her anything.
Until the destination, I didn't say anything, because I was nervous that he put my hat in my car.
And when he put the bags down from the car, I noticed that it smelled and hated.
She put the bags down from the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I put two meters in the back to get back, and I realized I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and moved the car back and forth, so that the smell would disappear.
At the bus, I didn't see if anyone was helping to get the bags down, because I had lights in my back and I didn't see well in my glasses.
"There were two bags of plastic and one of rafie," the man said.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, she says she's beginning to soften her curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something was wrong.
After she gave her bags down, I went to the hospital, to Primarie, and when I got back, I especially forgot to see what the woman was doing with the luggage.
She carried through the luggage after the fence, where there are also the graves inside the market.
Then I left again.
It was a little agitated, because there was a microbus from Italy and a bus.
I've seen women go to their drivers to get into them, to disappear, but probably the drivers didn't want to take it, because they have international races, and I don't take passengers on occasion.
The woman was very agitated, she walked over and over there.
At one point, the woman entered Peco and, curiously, I asked an employee outside what she had done inside.
The employee replied that he went and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where the police patrol was, because I had seen it a while ago.
I looked for them and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and told them it was something suspicious.
"Then I went somewhere else, a race to Belcești," Mihai added.
He told us the woman got upset after she left the bag at the Tomberoons.
To me, the suspicion went away from the fact that the luggage was gone, and I was curious what he did with it.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and showed her to me, telling her that I warned her that she had a suspect bag.
Then the woman went to the Tomberoons and showed them the luggage.
"I went back to the place where I hid the bags around 3 o'clock when I made statements to the police and the local prosecutors," the taxi driver concluded his report.
The German prosecutors, who are investigating the case, say that the 64-year-old professor, Ana Zacharia, was surprised to see the rooms of a gas station in Rome at 0.55, taking up the three bags in the bus.
She arrived at Targu Frumos at 1.30.
According to the investigators, she would have killed her husband, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, and then she had him dragged into the house.
The man was called Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was a reserve officer.
On Sunday evening, the woman put the pieces of the body in two plastic bags, which she transported to the garage, and hid them.
The other night, he transported one more, then decided which direction to go, and chose the bus Bucharest - Iaşi.
Yesterday, the prosecutors still didn't know where the woman hid her husband's internal organs, nor the genitals.
The head, however, was found sealed in newspapers and bags, in a leak from the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until last night, the prosecutors did not find out from a woman who was the reason why she killed her husband with so cold and sadistic blood.
Most likely, the professor will be mentally experienced, and the body will be examined by legal doctors, to formally determine the cause of death and any other relevant details.
The Prime Minister took over national roads from the municipality, after years of government taking over, to be able to raise money from the national budget in the 2004 electoral campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL), and in order to be implemented a decision by the Government is necessary.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a matter for the institution to give its opinion on the General Urban Plan (PUG).
The mayor took over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any case, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 obliges the municipality to take the national roads passing the municipality.
No opinion can be delivered from the National Roads unless the law is respected, so it was necessary to approve this.
National roads have been in our administration since today.
"Of course, the government decision will also have to be issued as a result of this local Council decision," said interim Prime Minister Mihai Chirica.
National roads requiring the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The 28th National Road beats the ice on the arteries: the Päcurari road, the Monteni road, the Moara de Foc, the Silvestri road, the Silvestri road, the Nicolae Iorga street, the Primăverii road, the Chisinau road, the Túzora road until exit from the municipality to Tomești - Albíţa.
The other national road, DN 24, includes the Bucium hall, bd. Socola (up to semafor), Bucium street (up to Base 3), Chisinau Road, bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, bd. C.A. Rosetti and exit to Carlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
In the continuation of the description of files from the "dose" of Mircea Eliade's youth political sympathies, which, however condensed, would be presented beyond the size of a daily article and should be broadcast in series, deserves, I think, the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most powerful heads of prosecutions used by the detractors of the great Romanian scientist.
A less immoral description would, I hope, be useful in the real debate that the law recently says "anti-legislative" would seem to be in the Romanian intellectual environment.
By criticizing the various versions that spoke of Elijah's regiment in the Legion through the Cube "Axa" and Radu Gyr, Florin Ţurcanu brings into discussion the volume of Elijah's Mircea.
The prisoner of history (Bucuresti, 2003), another hypothesis, which we are most interested in understanding the resumption of the epistolic contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after Ceausescu played "the balcony scene" in August that year.
Based on the documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure during the Security investigation in 1941, documents kept today in the SRI archive (FD, Dosarul 573, f.15) as well as on a 1938 follow-up note, Florin Ţurcanu states that "Eliade will not enter their group, but thus said "legionary family" called Luminita, a group of "cuburi" intellectuals, especially writers, led by Radu Gyr."
Since there is no verifiable data on the Luminian dove, the exiles consider this "legional family" to be questionable, which must be discussed, until the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
Leaving to a surprising part of the SRI's kindness to make these secret files available to Mr. Türcanu, it is more than obvious that, at that time, the aim of the pursuit of Security was to "commandant" Radu Gyr, Elijah's mention was made, in accordance with the note of 21 March 1938, in the context in which Armand Calinescu, the Minister of the Interior received the free hand to take all the necessary measures to enable King Carol to impose his royal dictatorship, suspending parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of the legionarians who began to enjoy an unexpected popularity (All Party for the Third Country in the 1937 elections).
Eliade's arrest was carried out as a result of this note, quoted by Ţurcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, in the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as an underlying bureaucratic coverage for repression in 1938 and it is likely that such superficial notes were made at the scene for the vast majority of legionaries or supporters of the public space that had to be arrested, but had to be linked by an important legional leader.
Radu Gyr's olographic declaration, recalled above, was in custody in February 1941, after the collapse of the Legional Rebellion, only confirms it retrospectively on the first, the banal method of bureaucratic coverage in any police regime, author.
It would be interesting if Ţurcanu had provided more details on the content of the 573 mentioned.
Was it Elijah's or Radu Gyr's file?
Because it has to be a file built on the basis of security documents, but then processed by Security to be used either against each other.
There is an error here, as in the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only someone who knows the establishment of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that it represents a pre-eminent stage, by proof, in which the person concerned behaves as an active sympathizer, in the three-year trial period before becoming "compared" with acts in a regular manner.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as intellectual clubs or concerts, sedentaries, discussion groups with citizens, youth organisations or students were gravitated around a cube, were his "family", not his own cub, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuances completely escapes the uninvited reader by making Elijah's "member" status (which may be plausible) to be understood and used by the letter to designate political regulation in the cube.
Of course, the call for sub-utilized interpretation of this genre cannot hide the public support activity of the Guard and no clear sympathy for the Captain who animated Elijah between 1935 and 1940, whether in the seat of Nae Ionescu or not.
Public support for a cause in which you believe, however, does not necessarily mean that the political regulation itself said as much as, as usual, intellectuals of this size retains a type of superiority over activists as such and does not enter politics unless they are directly given high privileges.
As much as I could have formed an opinion about Elijah's thinking of that period, where he was "the leader of the generation", I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchical rigors of a legendary cube.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendant, though!
To no longer mean, but in the past, that, in any "legionary" amount, what it receives is anti-Semitic public activity as well as violence, both worthy to be stigmatized, but in the case of Elijah, until new evidence.
With regard to Eliade-Gyr's correspondence from 1968 to 1969, Mircea Handoca, an enthusiastic advocate of Eliade, is trying to sanction Florin Türcanu's claims (based, however, on some archive documents, even if it deserved more serious and contextualized) with a debateable argument.
Mircea Handoca notes, in the volume Noi gloze on Mircea Eliade (Bucuresti, 2006), that "no line of correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr does not contain any allusion to this frame".
There was no way in 1968, when Radu Gyr, who was somewhat alive from the communist circles, could not have risked any allegations in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think was meant to highlight Mircea Handoca is that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectable, admiration and affection without any doubt about Elijah's rise.
There really is no palest suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been Elijah's boss.
intelligently, the poet obliged to write at the Patriarch's Glass, unveils himself from the head of the place the stupendous condition signaling to Elijah (who knew very exactly what the mission had that publication that was constantly dealing with defiling the right exile), in the signature, after "your old friend", what to wait for and is easily and happily visible when it responds to him emotionally after almost three decades of separation since "the vicle year" has alienated him.
There is no doubt that beyond the "mission" with which he was charged (to convince Elijah that now, in the new Romania, he could return peacefully even to see his mother and friends) and that, possibly, he fulfills the dry and short proposals, separated by paragraphs, to suggest their character as a foreign body, Radu Gyr does not show his interest but for literature.
No mention of esoteric allusions, suggested refined political complications or any mention of the years of youth in a register other than the cultural one.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior to Eliade's legendary line, but until the consolidation of this version with less circumstantial evidence than that provided by Florin Ţurcanu, we have in this corresponding memory gaps that testify to a mutual appreciation of some people who have marked different, but stately, our culture and who, beyond the trials of life, find the tone of civilization and interbelic education.
Important human and cultural documents, and why not, for the strength of friendship and mutual respect beyond the "under time" fate of the authors.
In the early 1970s, Eliasde finally gave up his refugee status by obtaining American citizenship and, under the pretext of the country's health problems and floods, announced to the RSR authorities through the embassy (which carried a sporadic correspondence used to obtain passport for his sister), that he could not take the invitation to return to the country.
The next was predictable: it's back to the index, it's mounted in Israel "toladot business", the books sent to the family and friends (Fragments of a newspaper, Gallicard, 1973) are stopped by censorship, never returns his mother.
Among the country's friends only with Noica has a sporadic correspondence, although surprisingly, as a Chicago personal archive attests, a lot of individuals or Romanian institutions are more able to send messages to them.
It's clear why Radu Gyr didn't get permission to write after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceausescu regime tried Elijah's second convincing operation (by official invitations, Noica's departures, translations, etc.) Radu Gyr has already passed into eternity.
New coach, foreign player
Due to the impasse of indigenous volleyballists, Penicilina Iași tested in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Exhibits participate in training tournaments under the command of coach Dan Gavril
Back in the first half of the year of Division A1 of Women's Flights, Penicilina Iași kept her place in the first stage due to the retreat and then the decommissioning of the Miroslava Science, freshly promoted in the first stage following a baraque tour even in the issuing community.
The news took little of the unprepared leadership of the drawing group, which woke up without the main coach (after the departure of Rare Puni, reached second to Science Bacau) and many missing players, some retired like Cristina Lungu and the free Diana Studeanu, or left, as Ana-Maria Berdilla (at the Alba Blaj Volleyball) and the sisters Maria and Iuliana Fica.
Fire, until the start of the championship scheduled for 10 October, existed and there is still time to complete the lot.
First, a new coach was found in Dan Gavril's person, who came from the male LPS Piatra Neamt team and who has worked little in the last years at Penicilina, able to sign a contract with the group led by the Left Vasile.
Two players were then brought from Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconică, being tried and several foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, closer to being the holiday player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrin Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Peniciline lot led by Dan Gavril performed a cantonment at the Gura Humor, after which he participated in a tournament held at Lugoj and equipped with the Banatlu Cup, in which the winners won a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but also suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, in the period from 23-25 September, Penicilina will take part in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new championship, we're trying to build a valuable team.
We have a skilled and experienced trainer, but the player fund in Romania is quite small and that is why we will call on the volleyballists from abroad, especially after it has been decided that teams can use an unlimited number of players from outside the country.
This decision will affect the younger generation of athletes from clubs in Romania.
"We hope to reach the end of the competitive year at 5-6 places, even if it will be very difficult," said Vasile Left, president of the ACS Penicilina Iași.
Emotional meeting.
Gems assembled after nearly 70 years
The twins George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, 69 years old, were born at the end of World War II in Germany, after their Polish-born mother had barely been released from a labor camp.
Since she was too sick to care for her, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, the two brothers were thus separated not only from the one who gave them life, but also from the other.
For decades George and Lucian did not know each other about existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered documents that showed that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the 1960s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they did not find any clues that would lead him to Lucian.
Just in 2015, thanks to the "Restoring Family Links" program of the Red Cross, the twins met again, and the moment was one more than exciting.
BBC reporters have surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iaşi brought four medals from Stuttgart to sports dance
Two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze medal were won by children leaving the German Open Championship at Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organised by the German Sports Dance Federation and the World Sports Dance Federation.
In Iaşi, five couples attended the Dance Energy Club and danced along with 9,000 athletes from 20 countries.
The 10 children who left took part in five different categories (youth 1, youth 2, youth 2, youth and amateurs).
Those who returned home with medals were the pearls: Rázvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Târzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Ştefana Gologan (bronz medal).
And three other couples managed to occupy the front seats: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Iosub Cubbe and not lastly the couple Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ionica.
As a coach, I greatly wanted to reaffirm the results obtained in March this year, and this confirmation is needed for both us and sportsmen, both in terms of their future developments.
The fact that we have managed to make Romania's name heard twice this year at the German Open and return home with four medals gives us great joy and gives us hope and confidence that we can lift both the club and its athletes to a higher level.
"All of these would only be feasible with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," said Andreea Ramona Manolache, a coach for children at the Dance Energy Club.
Romania was represented this year by 34 clubs from the country, it obtaining a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country in place 4 of the 20 participating countries.
To mention that of the nine medals, four came to Iasi.
6 ways to escape stress in a minute
Too few of us allow ourselves to run off a weekend on the mountain to escape stress.
Some keep our time, others keep our finances, and others keep both of them in check.
But there are solutions at the expense of anyone who wants to escape some stress.
They do not involve any high costs and no special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
The day-to-day concerns are inevitable, but it depends on us how we deal with them and how we deal with them.
Instead of messing around inside and feeling like an implosion takes place in your mind, you better try the next tactics of relaxing that won't steal you for more than a minute.
Deep breath
Respiratory exercises are not limited to soloists or yoga practitioners.
They function for any person in part, and regulating breathing in a tense moment helps to release endorphins into the body, which leads to a state of relaxation, reports Livestrong.
Be a Child
We know we're past the age of childhood and we don't let ourselves get up when we have a boss.
But that doesn't mean that we can't go into a corner of the office office or anywhere we know we're alone (even behind the building) and don't know how much we're doing.
You can escape the nerves and negative energy accumulated during one day with some healthy flying.
Imagine a beautiful place
We know that the recommendation was worthy of replicating it during a psychotherapy session, but I don't blame psychologists for using it often.
The imagination of a beautiful place, which inspires us to calm down and detach the daily braking, can lead to attenuating the nerve state.
It is, in fact, self-suggestion, a process that can even change lives, both good and bad.
It all depends on what we suggested.
The best thing is to think about an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to music
Put your castles in your ears and listen to the music of relaxation.
Attention, it's not about the favorite music, because if it's about heavy metal you might be having a hard time relaxing.
Listen even to the songs of relaxation, which are lines and do not contain verses, to rebalance the moment when your fist is lit.
Decoy the orange
Does it sound strange to have a nerve orange?
Well, it's not!
Caci is not about fruit in itself, because it does not contain miraculous substances or Xanax to totally disconnect us (occasionally, too total).
It's about aroma therapy!
The smell of orange coyote, during decoying, stimulates the brain to produce endorphins, the hormone of the good state.
Mangai and animals
Those who have animals close to them, whether it's the home, or it's the one who's gone to work, take a few seconds to eat it.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, pets may lower blood pressure.
time and rock with fork and guitar
Two musicians in love with some rival instruments, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous pieces of the Roman folklore combining the violin with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to Christian Horia and Emilian Florentin Georghe musicians and is entitled WHEN violin Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We have found ourselves, and since then it has made us very happy to sing together, having a practically unlimited repertoire."
We thought this was the moment when a viola with a guitar met.
Cristi: "From the first meeting we realized that what we were singing is very good and that from the point of view of the human component, things are working."
Each of us has learned from walking from the other directory and, what is very important, is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there's a gap between classical music and the rest."
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And in the second round we were still a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that could make those who only listen to classical music listen and rock, and those who only listen to rock get to like classical music.
And we were surprised to be told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they'd listen to such a thing and they'd like it.
Cristi: "When we find young people - and we find more and more - who know who Pink Floyd was, it seems amazing to us."
The students in Iaşi stayed in traffic more than at school on the first day after their vacation
Hundreds of exits were "captive" yesterday morning in the infernal traffic in several areas.
The Prime Minister announced that today the Mangeron Boulevard (Ballui Malhäng), between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roş, is closing.
The Prime Ministers have failed to meet their promises to carry out work to liquidate traffic at the beginning of the school year.
One of the assurances given by the municipality, at least twice in the last weeks, has been found to re-establish the rotation in the International War Zone.
Although only a few items had to be installed, and the final deadline for the work was the end of last week, yesterday the rotation was not accomplished.
Drivers' nerves have been stretched to the maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, given that another Prime Minister's promise has been violated: the shift of customs activity from Nicolae Iorga to Tehnopolis "by the end of August", in the context of which this transfer has been discussed since 2012.
Currently, interim Prime Minister Mihai Chirica says the problem of the International Race is more complicated.
The rotation will be made at the right time, we need to take into account the traffic in the area, we need an opinion from the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbabwe, where it's time for the tram to stay in rotation, but we'll sort it out," Chirica said.
One of the solutions, according to him, would be to stop the tram with a semafort before turning.
The problems in circulation were also in the intersection of the Red Pod.
The line of cars on the street St. Lazarus stretched to the SRI headquarters.
"I waited a good minute for me to get out in the Red Pod," said one exit.
By Podu Roş, they had to cycle the tramway to the CUG in September, if the rehabilitation project "South Functional Arterial Development and Rehabilitation" was completed in the initial execution period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complement it at first.
"I drew European funds for new works, for example overhaul, on the original version of the Nicolina Passion was narrow," Chirica commented.
The most recent deadline for the reintroduction of tram traffic is October.
During yesterday's day, the exits reported problems in traffic mainly in areas such as Păcurari, Centre (Târgu Cucu, Independence, Armenian Street) or the intersection of Base 3.
Admonition could return as head of CJ.
In the course of tomorrow you'll know for sure.
The judges of the Court will decide tomorrow whether the suspended President of the Jewish Council will maintain judicial control and prohibitions.
The judges of the Iași Court have decided yesterday a new term in the "Album", in which he is also the suspended President of the Iaşi Jewish Council.
At the end of yesterday's sitting, the judges decided to give their opinion during the morning on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against the Admonition.
It subsequently wishes to reside or withdraw this measure, which keeps it away from the head of the CJ for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if it is kept naked and by the superior court, Christian Adomnity will be able to resume its office as President of the CJ.
Admission was sent to the court by the Antico Rut National Directorate (DNA), accused of favouring the maker and false intellectual after, pro curators say, he would have tried to mask an audit check which revealed a number of irregularities in the reception of a public contract signed between CJ and Laser Co.
Adomnition would have tried to hide the fact that the institution which led it would not have received more materials for the promotion of the Iași judge, although these materials were written as received by the CJ.
He has been referred to justice and three directors of the CJ, but also to the administrator of Laser Co.
There are still 3,500 votes expected until 25 September
The principal is prepared to distribute other questions if the 12,000 will be exhausted.
The exits have only ten days left to express their opinion on replanting the Great Stephen.
According to municipal officials, up to now about 8,500 of the 12,000 questions distributed at the neighbourhood centres and in three additional points in the city (Copou Park, Alexander the Good and Primitry Esplanada).
A record number of outputs was presented on Sunday in front of the Prime Minister.
According to representatives of the civilian group "Iaşul loves teai", 530 participants voted in 140 minutes, respectively nearly four votes expressed every minute.
On the other hand, over the course of the month, about 440 people came out in the same place.
Volunteers in the group say that many outputs call for signs and populations to suffer from inefficient public consultation.
Therefore, they made a call yesterday to Internet users to print a group information display and label it on block stairs.
Volunteers also showed that at the additional point in the Copou Park the last formulas were completed by Sunday outputs.
We'll offer formulas from the neighborhood centers, where they don't get too complete.
"Any additions will be made when all 12,000 forms will be completed," said municipal spokesman Sebastian Buraga yesterday.
"Non-Terres" will end on 25 September, and if the majority vote of the outputs is in favour of replanting the trees then the Prime Minister will plant your silver in this fall.
The exits can express their opinion at the neighbourhood centres in Dacia, Beautiful, Tatarași, Nicolina and Păcurari, as well as in the additional points mentioned above.
The Chiefs of the Prime Minister decided to cut off Stephen the Great in early 2013, an action that attracted an amendment of 60,000 lei to the municipality.
The decision was taken unilaterally, without consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civic group "Iaşul loves hers", an online community comprising about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for their replanting was signed, until last night, by more than 9,100 supporters.
RECORD of students registered at USAMV Iași!
I'm 920 in year I
The university has 920 students this year in year I.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionscu de la Brad" stated that this year were the most admitted candidates ever from the history of higher education.
We are very grateful for the results this year of admission.
We have the largest number of candidates admitted in the history of the university, nearly 920 students in the year I. I have never exceeded that number.
"We also had senior candidates, we took the seats from the budget to the license and master," said Prof. Ioan Tienu, the procurator responsible for the teaching activity.
It further stated that the university has registered a considerable number of taxed students, occupying 20% of those places, a significant figure greater than in other years.
Although the results at the Romanian-language study lines have also been published, admission to the English-language study programme from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine has continued to compete for 50 places, where the fee is EUR 5,000, and now the Minister's response is expected to confirm the required student files and study visas.
At the autumn session, a total of 120 files were filed in 14 budgeted places and 209 were released for "tax" competition in the licensing studies.
Most files were submitted to the Faculty of Agriculture, in number 75, to Horticulture, were 23 and to Zootechnie, 22.
In the autumn 18 files were submitted to the master, at the 150 places at the rate proposed by the USMV, seven of them at Agriculture, five at Horticulture and six at Zootechnie.
Drivers are afraid to enter with the wheels of the machines into the wrecks of the Tudor Vladimirescu Bridge
The bridge over the Bahlui on Tudor Vladimirescu's bulevard remained as narrow as when "The Day of Iaşi" wrote about the problems they presented 10 days ago.
Our daily reporters then pointed out that on the axis that delimits the two directions of walking the asphalt left, defending deep pits, some even 20 centimeters, showing the concrete plates that represent the primary infrastructure of the bridge.
The asphalt also began to be fixed on one side and on the other side of the axis, indicating signs that the depths would be accentuated.
At that time, interim Prime Minister Mihai Chirica points out that the bridge has no structural problems, having recently been made a technical expertise to start a project to rehabilitate the bridge and track, worth EUR 5 million.
Prime Minister Chirica states that the area affected by fissures and pits will be signalled, with rapid asphalt restoration work being carried out.
The only measures taken so far, however, have been the assembly of pipes and a signaling belt, without even making a simple plumbing.
In this period, we have focused more on opening up the school and the necessary work to this end.
"There is currently a point-to-point expertise for the bridge that we expect for about a week with the necessary details of the intervention, I appreciate that in no more than two weeks we could get through to remedy the situation," said the interim mayor.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
The preparatory class, as he's trying to improve the situation.
I don't know if I'm gonna be happy or let go of melancholy; I turn, passively, to the second.
First of all, because I have the feeling that it's only been three weeks, not three years since I took him first, with emotion, to the garden.
Even though he is easily frustrated, no normal parent is happy to raise his children.
Secondly, because I remember perfectly the same day of my childhood; then began a story that has not yet ended.
I wasn't exactly what's usually called a conscious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
But I always liked school.
So much so that I chose to continue to attend it, even as a teacher.
When I decided that's what I want to do all my life, I knew it wasn't an easy job.
And no one with a table.
That's because, like each one of us, I've given myself over the whole range of teachers: better or worse, more sympathetic or unbearable, more you know or have the right to be an idiot.
It happens, unfortunately, that there are people with other calls in this brasla.
I think they're toxic because they hurt the enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to form.
I had the luck to give, as long as I was a student or student, over a few, a few, exceptions.
These meetings can be crucial if they are to be held at the right time.
Who thinks the role of the headquarters is the ban on the transmission of information is bitter.
This can be done by anyone; to be informed, the student can be very well informed by himself, that we are only living in a time of transparency.
A good teacher, however, models the minds of the students.
He's training them. He's pampering their thinking.
Staying at headquarters is not a privilege, as I think it is, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very sloppy, demanding, unforgiving and always willing to search for the hybels in front of them.
That's what age dictates, temperament.
As a teenager, we all thought that we knew everything, that we had unwarranted convictions about anything.
When we mature, we understand that we have only doubts.
Therefore, the role of a teacher is to get the adolescent out of the category of self-sufficiency and make him think.
I mean, he's starting to doubt himself, ask questions.
Find out the answers on their own, whether they or the provisional ones.
Get involved in everything he does.
Direct him discreetly to the profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially that most of the time the student thinks the teacher is his enemy.
One who is barely waiting to get him wrong to punish him.
But this rights him, the unintelligible, rebellious, guilty man to live his life full of old calls, to look at the man in the chair with suspicion.
That he just doesn't have a way to naturally accept his attempt to order him.
Adolescents do not get caught, do not accept restrictions.
Or if I give the impression that I'm doing it, she'll get revenge somehow.
And unfortunately, when there is a stiff person at the headquarters, who insists on being tough and does not communicate, the students take revenge on the object handed down.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with the great writers, of course, because of the lack of tact of the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who have the impression that history is a data merge, that mathematics is all that can be more tiring for their inappropriate mind.
I always ask for students: if you give a professor who doesn't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him take you away from the literature to which you should be directed.
How did it happen that I became the dachal myself?
I had a very good teacher in the VI-VIII classes.
He opened my mind to some texts that have spoken to the public since then on his understanding.
I've already met, in high school, a university professor who opened my library door.
I looked at him like a man in another world: he had walls of the house covered with paper rafts.
I was lost in his library and I dreamt I had one.
Now I might have it, but if I hadn't had my fate thrown out, I might have decided to become a footballer.
Or a engineer or a lawyer or who knows what else.
I don't think such meetings are happening.
I don't believe in luck.
It is essential that you give yourself over to the man who takes your hand and patiently directs you to your vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the professor.
Now, my experience helps me just to discuss what it means to teach literature.
It's just that literature can't be handed over.
There is no professor of literature, as there is a professor of mathematics.
How do you fix the inefficiencies?
You can, by the way, approach it, without claiming to convey petrified truths.
The man at the cathedral can guide the reading as much as possible, that's all.
But above all, it can attract some miraculous encounters, between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that can open his mind, which can raise his voice, his tears.
Therefore, the professor of literature must firstly manage to make his students understand (if they feel) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great coseur, Al. Paleologist, says just a seeming paradoxical thing: "How much literature, so much life, not vice versa!" and he was right.
That's why, a good record prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in an open field anyway.
Fortunately, we always have something to learn.
And we teachers; or especially new teachers.
Most of the time, only a great truth is repeated by the inertia: not only do the students have to learn from their teachers, but also vice versa.
Ideally, the teacher should be a teacher, and the student should be a student.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
A little I find him, he's right.
But the master was the one who lighted the curtain.
I don't think there's more happiness for a professor of pure blood than to endure as many such divisions.

If FIFA expands its investigation
The US Justice and Switzerland will face new arrests
The US and Swiss authorities have announced that criminal prosecutions will begin in the case of new persons and organisations, in the FIFA corruption investigation, informs the international press.
US Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced on Monday at a press conference organised in Zurich that the area of research on corruption in world football was widened.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will commit additional criminal prosecutions to the address of new individuals and new organisations," Lynch said.
In May, more senior FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been deported to the United States.
"We have hope that other people who are being prosecuted will also arrive in the United States," Lynch added.
Switzerland's Attorney General Michael Lauber, also at the press conference, said that his institution had sequestrated several property, including houses and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the course of the US-cooperation investigation.
"I haven't reached the end of the first surprise," said Lauber.
So far, a very large amount of information has been confiscated, 11 terabytes.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are being investigated.
The researchers also entered into a contract for the surrender of media rights to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and 2014 - Brazil.
FIFA faces a major corruption scandal, after the US justice has brought 14 people to trial, including two FIFA Vice-Presidents and seven forum officials.
Persons detained are researched for bribery and other benefits, from the beginning of 1990 and up to now, totaling more than $150 million.
Following this scandal, Swiss Joseph Blatter announced, at the beginning of July, that he resigns from the FIFA presidency, after being real for the fifth time.
Boats like movies at the theater
In the Soupkombat Gala de Milano, Cătălin Moroşanu will fight with the "beast" James Wilson
A series of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Cătălin Moroşanu, will take part, on 2 October, in the Supercombat gala of the Linear 4 Ciak Theatre in Milan, the last before the end of November, in a communiqué handed down by MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as I promised, we will return in this fall with a new five-star gala.
If we still choose an unpublished venue, a theater, then we promise to fight like in movies.
We're going to have eight Romanian fighters on the event program.
In addition to the matches with the already consecrated sights, we will have another hole in the opening, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, including the Romanians Cristi Spetcu, Christian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"The full programme will soon be announced," said promoter Eduard Irimia.
Cătălin Moroşanu will fight in the Supercombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination branch with American James Wilson, known after he participated in the last pyramid in 2012 in the heavy category organized in Japan and numerous prizes from bodybuilding wins.
I can't wait to fight in Italy.
I've seen Wilson, he's really an animal, but I'm demolishing him!
I'm still angry that last year I couldn't fight in the end, so now I'm going to take revenge on him.
"From the beast it's turned into a cat," Moroşanu said.
In 2015, the Andrei and Bogdan Stoica brothers will have the last confrontations in Italy before fighting for world titles on 7 November in the final sea.
Last year, both of them were forced through KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the script.
I'm happy to go back to Italy, last year's atmosphere was incredible.
"I can't wait to meet the fans there and promise them a new show of neutrality," world champion Andrei Stoica said.
Raul Cătinaş will also fight an opponent to be established in Milan.
A little girl invited the Queen of England to her day, but she had a written argument
A little girl in Britain sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to participate on her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for the longest ruler, but did not forget to mention the fact that she was not allowed access to Buckingham Palace when she went to visit him along with his family.
The inscription was not lost, but the girl received a reply from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked him for his invitation, but she apologized for not being able to be present on September 27th, because she really hated him to have fun with family and friends.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together to a talk show shortly before the poet Adrian Păunescu died.
Both writers died of heart.
The fate of Adrian Păunescu and of Vadim Tudor is similar.
Both were writers and politicians, and both were close to the age of heart.
Adrian Păunescu at 67, Vadim Tudor at 65.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Păunescu died, at a TV station.
Vadim Tudor ironized Gheorghe Flutur and criticised Elena Udrea, the Minister of Tourism since then, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At one point, Vadim Tudor said, with a smile at the jokes, to Adrian Păunescu: "I'm jealous of your glory, Adrian."
He said, "It's not very commendable what you told me right now."
Adrian Păunescu died on 5 November 2010, at the age of 67.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died today, 14 September 2015, at the age of 65.
Two People ASKED After an ACCIDENT in Dumbrava
An accident took place Monday night around 7:00 p.m. in the Dumbrava District of Iaşi District.
A biker was taken up by a Volkswagen bus.
The cyclist was not observed by the driver.
Fortunately, they're both stable.
As a result of the impact, the parking lot and the mirror of the cars were broken.
Two injured persons are unconscious at the time of transmission of this news.
A SMURD team is on its way to provide medical assistance to victims and to transport them to the hospital.
The cops are in front of the place.
An Syrian artist turned "Super Mario" into a refugee
An Syrian artist created a version with refugees of the popular game "Super Mario", which evokes the plight of his compatriots on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of the Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of Ciuppercilors, the modified video game has centred on the "Refugee Mario".
The person is trying to cross from trafficking in persons and the border police, on his way to a refugee centre in the European Union.
The artist established in Istanbul uses the pseudonym Samir al-Mutti for security reasons and said he made the video game with Mario refugee after his friends took a dangerous trip to Europe to escape the horrors of war.
At the Craiova Detention Centre the youngest student is 15 and is in class I
Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Centre, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I, and the greatest one is 25 years old and is in class XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I chose to participate in the opening of the school year in a centre belonging to the National Penitentiary Administration to try to draw attention, and in this way, to a few less known realities.
The youngest student, aged 15, is enrolled in class I, and the eldest is 25 and is enrolled in class XI.
"There are complicated issues which society is concerned about at this moment, we are all overwhelmed by our own concerns and problems, but we do not have to overlook the lesson that more than 100 young people from the Craiova Detention Centre offer," said Minister Robert Cazanciuc on Monday at the opening of the school year.
The Minister of Justice drew attention to the fact that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by the lack of material opportunities, may lead to tragedies, specifying that young people in this centre would have another chance in life if they could follow the Irish school course of any child, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to know what compliance with the law means and what consequences it may have.
"The role of the prison system is not to permanently isolate people who have violated the law, to close them behind high walls, but to try to educate them and prepare them, so that when they return to the middle of the community they will have more chance of reintegration," Cazanciuc added.
The Minister stated that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investments must also be made in the prison system, because, in many cases, conditions of detention are at the limit of humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and because of this partnership, every year in the prison system, there are more than 2000 graduates of school courses.
Obviously, we won't be able to change overnight what hasn't been done for 25 years, but there are important steps we're taking.
"In all these actions we also need the support of society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we owe ourselves, that by your work these young people have a chance and do not pose a danger to society," Cazanciuc said.
The Minister of Justice has successfully hated both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the joint effort of all.
"And because today is the celebration of the Highness of the Holy Cross, I would invite all students and teachers to visit the mausoleums of the Soviet Union, the Great and not only to understand what it means to fight young people for ideals," said Robert Cazanciuc.
A Russian came to the vote with the bear
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiarisms to be destroyed!
Request of prestigious university students from Iaşi and the country
Over 200 researchers, university frameworks, personalities and students from the country have signed a petition launched by the Romanian Academic Society requesting the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even decommission the doctoral schools in Romania "which allows and promotes academic taxation".
Among the signatories to the petition launched on 10 September are the educational framework and teachers in Iaşi.
Among the university's signatories to the petition in the academic environment is, for example, Prof. Liviu Antonesei.
At the national level, the petition has names from former ministers of Education, such as Mircea Microa, to cultural people who are also a university educational framework such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Law of Education provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been achieved so far, thus determining the lack of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools that flimsily violate ethical rules in scientific research and does not produce relevant and internationally recognised performance," the request is specified.
That request specifically requires compliance with the National Education Law, the evaluation of doctoral schools, the suspension of the right to operate for any doctoral school where more than two plagiarisms have been found, until the assessment and remedy of the situation.
The last requirement is the suspension of the right to operate for any doctoral school in which there are no minimum number of doctoral managers provided for by law to meet the criteria required by the National Scientific Research Council in 2011 for eligibility for IDEI type project grants.
Do you respect less a doctorate general, or a politician, or an information agent in the Middle East?
"Why isn't there any other academy in Europe to give doctorates organized by secret services, and the top military who give the doctorate to autonomous academic institutions, where the quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academic Society, initiator of the petition, and her from Iaşi.
This can be supplemented by all the requests on the Society's website, and the final signatures will be submitted to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The party "Pentru Iași", founded by young IT managers, was launched elsewhere in the Copou Park.
The president of the Initiative Group "Towards Iaşi" gave an interview "To the Iaşi Day"
The island will have a dedicated party exclusively for the development of the city.
A group of political unaffiliated entrepreneurs and managers has so far launched the Iasi Party at the end of last week, which will propose candidates for the 2016 local elections.
Currently, the core of the party is made up of IT specialists, but training promoters say that in the organization are welcome all people who want to be involved in modernising the city.
The launch took place on Saturday in Copou Park, and at the event more than 200 sympathizers participated, almost all being young.
The special invitation of the action was Nicosor Dan, president of the Rescue Association Bucharest.
He was surprised at the 2012 local elections, when, from an independent position, he managed to raise 10% of the votes of the cheerleaders for the capital's primary function.
"The people I've seen at "Pentru Iaşi" think they're very good at accessing Iaş's public administration."
I believe in this initiative, I think it has a chance, I think it may have more chances in a community smaller than that in Bucharest.
"I'll always be with you for "Iaşi," Nikuşor Dan said.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iaşi to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are more emotional and emotional.
I've been away on many short business trips, I've lived in Cluj for a year.
I've come back every time, because I felt that this is my house.
ZDI: Why do you now decide to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache:Now that we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have begun to know each other for a while.
We met in professional contexts, we started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we were more shy, in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, various building or charitable actions, and, in some cases, things have evolved naturally and organically and now it has happened to be the time when we reached the decision that we need to involve ourselves more than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects to improve the activity of local public administration!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimum informatication of primary activity so that different departments, institutions and regions cooperate as best as possible.
But, more importantly, they can publish transparent data on the activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects, etc. We are talking about information organization.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a particular neighborhood, public consultation of the affected people is important.
If we talk about efficiency, we don't have to forget about transport in common, we have the worst buses in the country.
We need to buy new means of transport.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city counts extremely much.
How would you promote the Isaac?
Andrei Postolache:You're on a plane and you're looking for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industrial events where you can "sell" the city.
You have to want to do this and you know to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and bring customers to Iaşi.
ZDI: What is the brand of Iaş?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we must be a city of technology, in one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we have to expand it, go to medicine, enter the robotics area, into the 3D printing, continue in this spirit and join such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I mean the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Iaş already has a historical brand that must not be changed, namely the cultural city.
I see the two elements in balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in the public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures that still win elections in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organizing, planning, communicating, working with people and projecting.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we talk to everyone, we're not just staying on Facebook, we're not online.
We don't want to have volunteers on the bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think they're pretty people like that.
ZDI: Should Iaş's prime minister be more concerned about promoting the image of the city at national and international level, or is it necessary that the area of concern be permanently built up?
Andrei Postolache: One without another does not work.
First of all, you need to solve today's problems, emergencies.
Or, if you don't make your known city, if you don't attract money in the city, at a certain point you're out of money and you won't be able to do it, for example, streets.
You have to do both at the same time and you have to have competent people next to you.
Not the mayor has to do everything.
We have to give up the model of the mayor, who comes and knocks with his fist in the table and solves everything.
Nope.
We're a team.
The mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people from the IT area who can support the party financially?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, have a reputation, be clear, and be honorable.
From this point of view, we don't have any other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or why not, 300,000 people who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015, Introspecials set up, after seven years, he was the director of the Endava International Group (2008 - 2015), where he coordinated a team of 300 people.

The Rabla tractor program proved to be a failure
The Director-General of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Mircea Oltan, said that the programme to stimulate the renewal of the national park of tractors and agricultural machines, launched in 2011, called the Rabla for tractors, was a failure due to bureaucracy.
With regard to the Rabla Programme, there have been some trials in recent years, but it has proved to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a farmer, and the approvals were too long and then the world gave up.
That program managed to sell it somewhere in 10 pieces.
"The tractor requirement for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," Mircea Oltan said.
According to it, IRU Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred tractors annually, being the largest in Romania, and that great competition is exercised by companies from abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It is a very great competition with those coming out, all world producers have looked at Romania, I know these things that I have told you, and they have special policies.
"In all trades there is great accumulation, all producers exhibit, come with all kinds of variants," Mircea Oltan stressed, which stated that IRUM Reghin produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forest tractors annually.
Through the Rabla tractor program, launched in 2011, those who owned old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as combinations, could be sold out and received a valuable 17,000 lei ticket in exchange.
The red flag has been raised
The internal vote of the Labourers seems to be more spectacular and more significant political, as the new elected leader automatically becomes his top-up in future elections.
So raise the red-white flag/ Under its wings we will live and die.
That sang yesterday, Jeremy Corbyn in the London Shrine House.
He witnessed many acts and oaths/ Let's not change his color now.
Readers who do not know the melodic line of this unofficial British and international left (The Red Flag) can search it online and would not have been excluded from a surprise.
With the heads discovered, let's all swear that we'll wear it until we're gone.
The author of these ranks is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and those who fly them), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn succeeds in joining the left of yesterday with that of tomorrow, this love story between him and the Labour Party base will be part of a happy-end.
I don't think it will happen that way, but it seems premature for me to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat, over five years, of another elected leader.
Now, however, we can refer to the procedures: we have witnessed a democratic exercise of an impressive range.
Not British labians invented the direct voting system for the party leader, in the middle of the west left.
French socialists have been working for several years on a more complicated system, based on motions, which allows the expression of all members and sympathizers; they have also organised a preliminary competition for the nomination of the candidate for the 2012 presidential elections.
However, the internal vote of the Labourers seems to be more spectacular and significant political, as the new elected leader automatically becomes its launch peak in future elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of political system, the customization of power being more pronounced in Britain than in the other part of the Channel of Man.
In addition, participation in the vote was high in all three "circles": its own members, trade unions and other organisations affiliated to the party and, finally, the group of sympathizers (who received the ballot after a summary registration procedure).
This latter group provides us with interesting information about the perceptions of the left segments of British society, especially of young or middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to engage more and more in the future just because of the signal offered by Corbyn's victory.
There are, as far as I know, sociological surveys that tell us too much about the attitudes of this "outside" laborist, so careful speculation is allowed.
I think we are meeting enough similar attitudes to those of the Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), as they will pass through the traditional channels of the left.
If we want to identify an "antisist", it is first reflected by rejecting the centrist line, New Labour (for many, only a dissimulated form of multi-hulit thatcherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of the leaders considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures, one of the arguments being that they did not go left enough, that they did not remain firmly demarcated by the Tony Blair era.
The second reper - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum on Scotland's independence.
If we abstract the separatist message and focus strictly on the aspirations of other political themes, we see that Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of public segments that favor the social state and are animated by the aspirations of equity, the acceptance of disarmament and the host of military involvement over decision-making, but also sensitive to the new themes of the left: ecology, gender, assistance for poor countries.
Scottish laborers thus lost an electorate who should have at least had a privileged access, but who can now recover (see their enthusiasm for Corbyn's campaign).
The same energy exists all over the United Kingdom, but the old leadership couldn't attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his vocation as an outsider, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, the "aristocrat" Labourer.
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than the left-wing anti-system in southern Europe.
The term "antistism" is too hard: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
By next week we will find out more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps as the leader of the opposition.
We'll see if somehow the Red Flag will also fall into the House of Commons (it wouldn't be for the first time), after the new leader will occupy his place, first of all the banks of the opposition.
Anyway, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is first of all unity - and in this regard there is even reason to be concerned.
Manipulation trap with or without science
While I was writing the article, I went through my head to check on the net story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" who became part of the second space dedicated by V. Marin to his "Jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could themselves make me from the beginning of the circumspect).
I didn't.
In last week's article (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") I commented in parallel with two pictures - the boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean coast and the one, in fact: the two facing Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh was taken from the article "Syrian Fighters Come With the Wave of Refugees" (marked by Viorica Marin in Truth of 3 September).
Monday night, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.
On Tuesday, entering Facebook, we found, among other things, a handhold shot by a friend (not only by FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscribe, rather than a specification. Laith al Saleh is not a jihadist".
On the contrary, he is a fighter against Al Assad for democracy and that.
"So you could add grossolan manipulation to the table!"
I have to admit, I felt bad.
The more I wrote the article, the more I went through my head to check on the net story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" who became part of the second space dedicated by V. Marin to his "Jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (those two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could themselves make me from the beginning of the circumspect).
Because I trusted the truth, his journalists.
Instead, I didn't have another comment to draw on Marius Cristian's hand than that: "That's what I need if I have faith in the truth."
After that, I obviously took the big money in the story and I owe it to readers with the correct presentation of the story of the Syrian Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest I found in an Associated Press material (Syrian rebel leader Seeks Europe - Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett from 17 August 2015 on the island of Kos in Greece, where they noticed, among the hundreds, perhaps thousands of refugees, on a man trying to make orders in the chaos of the crowd.
The man was Syrian striker Laith Al Saleh of Aleppo who "was used to be in command", since he "led a unit of 700 rebels in the Syrian civil war".
We also know that Al Saleh, at the age of 30, had "a house, a wife and a normal life before starting a struggle that cost more than 250,000 lives and set a third of the Syrian population on the road".
In an interview with Associated Press correspondents, Al Saleh tells that "everybody wants to leave Syria".
My city is the most dangerous cities in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, the government wants me to fight all of them.
Beyond the fact that he was kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a more and more sinister meeting - with a man who recognized an enemy of Syria": "Two days ago, I saw a Lunetist from government forces."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very upset.
We also find that Laith (meaning lion in Arabic) was actually on his way to the Netherlands, where he had a cousin - former senior officer in the Syrian army and then he became a rebel and arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get asylum and can bring his family back - wife and a three-year-old boy (almost an old man with the civil war in Syria, which broke out in March 2011).
After this was accomplished, Laith Al-Saleh would not have excluded a return to Syria to continue fighting for the Syrian Free Army (in the West) - against the three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (in the Russian), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
A madness - whoever wants freedom must fight in Syria against not one enemy but three!
I've already put on a Serbian material since August 22, from which I didn't understand much, just that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come together with migrants: Terrorists KRIJU MIGRANTIMA calls the title of a news from http://www.telegraf.rs/vez, in which a picture with Al Saleh with beards is accompanied by a Syrian flag and that of the refugee wearing the shirt with "HANK YOU".
On September 7th, then, himself on the BBC site, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of handling photos with the Syrian fighter: This viral photo fakely claims to show year IS file posing as a refugee - This viral photo claims that it is wrong to face an Islamic State fighter while taking refuge.
We find that the photo (in fact: the photos - the one with Laith with the beard and arm and the one with the THANK YOU) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would have asked for an apology between time.
Just before that, just on his walls, the picture with the two pictures would have been scratched more than 70,000 times, collecting a few thousand comments.
That's too late, the horse's gone!
In Romania, on 9 September Carla Dinu from Hotnews took the story with the manipulation of the BBC, but translated the title wrong: "A fake photo became the viral looks like an ISIS fighter giving himself as a refugee".
Obviously, the photograph is not false, but the interpretation was a false, wrong, in short: manipulation.
Champion at 21 years
Conqueror in the Iaş Ralium, Simone Tempestini secured his national title to the races, becoming the youngest winner in the history of the championship
The Iasulu Cotnari 2015 rally ended with a result of the young Simone Tempestini pilot, Italian with Romanian citizenship, who at the age of 21, won all the new special tests of the most difficult stages of the National Raliuri Championship.
