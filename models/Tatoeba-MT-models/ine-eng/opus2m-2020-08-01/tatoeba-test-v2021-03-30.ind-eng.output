Do you want something to eat?
Is your hope secure?
That'll certainly draw Tom's attention.
Ticket into the museum cost thirty dollars.
Do you want something to eat?
I work in Tokyo now.
Tom has lunch alone every day.
Let's defend our marriage.
You're not busy now, are you?
This room has its AC.
Why didn't you help him?
I got married when I was 19.
Didn't Tom really know how to cook?
Where's the supermarket around here?
Tom's hair's been washed.
Can I ask you something to drink?
I've done anything I can.
Please wear your shoes.
Tom's always good to me.
Where did he want to go?
He's a DJ.
We shouldn't have let Tom know.
Have you had dinner?
I was happy to read.
Which house do you live in?
My goal is to learn your language
I want to go for a drink.
When are you going to leave?
Why can Taro speak English that well?
Let's just do it now.
You're spreading lies.
What's wrong?
I was expecting you last night.
You just made me feel so happy.
Parents are usually very wise.
I was sleeping when Markus came.
I can't hold my right hand.
I'm hungry.
Yoko didn't answer my question.
Tom's very different from his father.
Like father, like child.
Some of my friends can speak English well.
Tom pointed to the floor.
He's been a very good man lately.
He's from France.
Tom knows he's hearing something.
It is more valuable than gold.
I will be happy to help him.
Learn about the foreign culture.
When did you start wearing them?
Tom wouldn't like that answer.
Oh, really?
I thought you were trying to call us back.
Without hesitation, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnicity and minority religion.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife's too thick, so I can't use it to cut the meat, and I'm finally using my pocket knife.
His eyes are blind.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom forgot.
Where are you?
The passing lamps are used to arrange the passing beam.
Don't let Tom see these photos.
This room got a little sunlight.
He's drawing a picture.
I shouldn't have crossed that red light.
Bring me some water.
I'm tired of not picking up.
It smells really bad.
Words are words.
There is no god but God, the Messenger of God.
I just found out yesterday.
You can buy it at the bookstore.
Let's get on Intercity-Express.
Thank you so much.
Yes!
My brother likes music.
It's very easy to hang out with Tom.
You want to go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I think I can come this afternoon.
"It's not worth waiting for two hours." "Yes! I'll keep this signature alive."
Tom is one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I just told Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's lime.
You'll never find a way home, through a narrow stone road.
Tom really wasn't at home when we came to visit him.
Mary was a beautiful girl.
That guy's driving a car.
There's a birthday card that'll be here soon.
Please read it again.
When do you get it?
I was just kidding.
Tom almost got hit.
I went too.
Love never goes wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
That fee has already included payment for professional services to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn the log, do you?
Tom tried to trick Mary into helping her.
Two things are not involved.
How am I not aware of this?
What's this called?
I'm staying at home because the rain's coming down.
That's the right answer.
In general, men run faster than women.
To me, there was no fundamental difference between the culture of those two countries.
He's hanging out.
Wake me up at eight o'clock.
Tell me why he's not here.
That may have affected their decision.
Its rains lasted for the entire night.
Tom's getting jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that terrible?
I'll buy this bag for you.
The cake's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Did you ever go to London?
This is our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready yet.
Mary refused to accept the invitation to the concert.
When are you going home?
He's sitting around his grandsons.
The boy was when he fell asleep in his bed.
Jim's still not used to driving on the left side of the road.
He's focused on those challenges.
That man died the world a few hours ago.
Want to go eat with me?
It feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We know that the front door is locked.
May I speak to Mr. Sato?
This water doesn't smell.
Mr. Smith is the acquaintance.
Thank you for your interest.
We've got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying with a plane.
I thought he was lying, but it didn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice.
I couldn’t finish reading this thick book in a week.
The choice of time is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have another choice.
I'm not sure what else to do.
We've done what we can.
Is there any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked all this way, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
All of us are equal before the law, but the rich at times have more advantage.
He must have made it.
I like cats.
It's almost over at nine o'clock.
Tom's mentally disturbed.
Maybe I'm crazy?
We faced a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone has made a mistake.
You better tell Tom not to.
My mother hasn't been here in ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with his car.
Can I see your coupon?
He looks serious about reading.
Tom married a woman that was easier than he was.
He's a copy of his father.
He has good words to insult himself.
Maybe I'm fat, but I'm excited.
He tried to kill himself, but he finally failed.
Do you have a light beer?
I want you to reconsider your decision.
If I reincarnate, I want to be born again as a cat.
We're getting a lot of rain this summer.
He made important scientific discoveries.
He's a student.
Tom's already here, but Bill hasn't come yet.
Laurie slowly.
They suggested that he go alone.
Tom is a good man.
I'll call you back in 20 minutes.
They're swimming.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom fooled Mary.
Not less than 40 percent of students went to pursue education at the university.
Tom put his pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom shook his voice so that no one could hear him.
You see anything?
What are you looking at?
Is he long hair?
He greets her every morning, when she enters the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
The seed was very tender, better to the left.
We didn't really see that accident.
His mother was worried about his son.
What's the opera showing at Lincoln Center right now?
I feel tired.
Tom was killed by Mary.
The data is often not accurate.
Get up!
We've ordered a six-and-a-thirty.
We named that dog Tim.
He opened the letter quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom told Mary to follow him.
It's been an hour.
I'm smarter than them.
The sky's getting darker.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knows her will be amazed at her.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The car's just gone.
They're crazy!
