You are driving slowly.
You are learning Irish.
You are our only hope.
You are reading.
You are reading.
That's how you'll fall!
You're sorry.
It's your face, Tom.
You're watching.
There's a great welcome.
You're all right.
You're busy.
You are writing.
You are writing.
Your friend is here.
Your mother lives in the Gaeltacht.
You are running.
You should complete the work.
You should ask him.
You speak.
You understand me.
You have three drinks of coffee.
You will enter that post.
