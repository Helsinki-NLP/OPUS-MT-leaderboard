Cumulative incidence in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronary disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, although at different stages according to the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly across all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of patients with COVID-19 who will require medical attention and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerate of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Control and Prevention of China’s Diseases reported that the causing agent was a new coronavirus that is now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (CVID-19).
The evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most are recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves towards a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (RU) and compare them with those of the Province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and RU countries
After China, the COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are now following that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In its edition of 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020 in persons who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (RU), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that inclusive date 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths were recorded, of which 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths occurred in Italy only.
Obtaining the accumulated amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), reports of cases of COVID-19 reported in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with those of Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of the active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 truncated to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA and RU country during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the accumulated number of cases reported in each country on 15 March 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases lasting 14 days in EU/EEA and RU countries generally followed that of the Province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then significantly increased around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA and RU countries showed upward trends in the cumulative incidence of similar COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and RU countries, compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It notes that as of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., other 15 EU/EEA and UK countries had already recorded a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is advancing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is so despite the different stages in which countries are present, variations in national public health responses and possibly different definitions in countries and different protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions to COVID-19 cases in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1 % of cases, respectively (data are not displayed).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a significant variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in every 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010-11).
Model scenarios related to the saturation of medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the RU of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk >90 % of the excess capacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since so far, cases have been conglomerated in certain regions of EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units normally meet a defined regional population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of statistical territorial units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly advancing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC's rapid risk assessment, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change of a restraint approach to a mitigation, as the rapid increase expected in the number of cases may not give sufficient time to decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response in a manner that is not implemented with anticipation.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to reduce the pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused the death of 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and other parts of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for humans.
Similarly to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the murceliac and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more communicable and affects older persons than young men and more men than women.
In response to the increasing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the research theme, which is being developed rapidly.
We will discuss the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions have not yet been answered, we hope that this analysis will help us understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unheard and unbearable memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home throughout the festival and for several weeks more due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a rash of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country and to almost 50 countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients with high data and more than 3000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19 have been published, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of isolated viruses of multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to sum up progress in research on this new matter that is rapidly developing.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, a outbreak in 2012).
We will also consider what has been known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some crucial questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15 % of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have met twice with highly pathogenic coronavirus in humans, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an original outbreak in China, in 2003, and Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with horrendous morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third by coronavirus of which is recorded in the history of mankind.
As shown in Fig. 1,1, conglomerates of unknown origin pneumonia were first informed on 31 December 2019 of Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medical care providers was reported, suggesting that transmission between humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had had direct contact with the Wuhan marine market that was considered the site of origin for the infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 countries around the world (fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8866 patients, including 4021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people from 30 to 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men more (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was expanded into conglomerates mostly in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, 5 days (from 2 to 9) would pass between the appearance and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95 % CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincides with the time of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate in confirmed patients was 1.44 % (95 % CI: 1.10-1.86 %), and the overall mortality rate adjusted was 3.06 % (95 % CI: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large and wrapped viruses that contain a single-sensual chain DNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus are those that infect humans.
The spigot glycoprotein (S) of the envelope is joined to its cellular receptors, angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme and dipeptide peptidease 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
Viral RNA genome is released to cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA, together with the glycoproteins of the envelope and the nucleocapside proteins, forms vescules containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98 % in 10 sequential samples taken from the original site of outbreak: the Juanan de Wuhan marine market.
The SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more like SARS-CoV than the MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-delegated sections of the human respiratory epithelial.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein joins human ACE2 weaker than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by the orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by the orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may have a viral pathogenity function and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or reason.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the structure of electronic cryomicroscope of the complete human ACE2 in resolution 2.9 Å, in conjunction with the transporter amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed compositions, was assembled as a dam, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of the crown virus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic dial for the drug study in order to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The source and the intermediate guest
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in turtles and were transmitted to humans through civilians and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, it was considered to be the native guest of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical in 96% to two coronaviruses similar to SARS called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown what an intermediate guest helped the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans, and the transmission route remains unsolved.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the human musculoskeletal virus, which involved homologous recombination within protein S.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long psychiatric mammals that are fed with hormones and that are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine) are an intermediate guest of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1 % spread over the whole of two genomes remains a major difference; therefore, final results are expected to provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a moisture of 40-50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75 %, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective to disable the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
So far, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Therefore, we can only use previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig.
In general, after the virus invades the guest, it is first recognized by the guest's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectine receptors, type Toll receptors (TLRs), type NOD receptors (NLRs) and type RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of Type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophytic phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape from immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is added to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the defence.
T CD4+ cells stimulate cells B to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and T CD8+ cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
Cooperative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help the defensive cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing the apoptosis of T cells.
Humorous immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organism failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by conglomerate appearance, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated average of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the population of 8866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adapt the effective quarantine time according to the most accurate incubation period; this is how asymptomatic infected persons are expected to transmit the virus to others.
As a usual practice, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The fever is usually the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by any other symptom or other symptoms such as dry cough, dysnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dysnea or hypoxaemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients evolved rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory and acute fever, even without pulmonary anomalies in imaging studies, should be tested for an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 indicated that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for drought, 55% for dyspnoea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar greetings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dysnea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80 per cent of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the highest lethality of COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99 %-100 %), dryness (29 %-75 %), dysnea (40 %-42 %), diarrhoea (20 %-25 %) and throat pain (13 %-25 %) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance were required in approximately 14 % to 20 % of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10 per cent in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37 % in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was high and raised to 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) of 95 % from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 only increased between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The previous figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is less than that of the latter two.
It is therefore much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, as a cruiser.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks prior to appearance.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients with high blood pressure from the hospital can return to contracting the virus, a warning signal that quarantine should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a count of white blood cells <4×109/l, including a count of lymphocytes <1×109/l, and high levels of aminotransferase aspartate in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
Hepatic and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels were high in the blood of some patients, and reactive protein C and erythrocytic sedimentation were high in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimero-D level, a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, was high, and the count of lymphocytes was gradually reduced.
Anomalies are detected in the thoracic radiographs of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shades or opaques in bilateral oscillated glass in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect gas exchange.
Dysfunction of Type I and Type II tumours decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, reducing the lung capacity to expand and increase the risk of pulmonary collapse.
As a result, the worst findings in thoracic radiography are usually in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the decomposition of the neutocytes, the formation of a hyalin membrane and the infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstitial, and multinucleated synthetic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a chain reaction of polymerase with reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China began to be used on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a CHERLOCK-based technique protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic parts of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per sample microlitre) using a graduated wire within an hour that does not require complex instruments.
Fortunately, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if it is found in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians may mostly provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
The plasma of recovered patients for treatment has been proposed.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the digestive system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Respiratory assistance is therefore critical to relieve symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat potentially fatal heart or respiratory impairment.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary and septic infections, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokines storm is the result of an exaggerated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokines storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNv, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals that are the main cause of SDRA and multi-organism failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokines storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal IL6 receptor antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm are the modulation of the immune response directed by T cells; the blocking of IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF; the inhibition of JAK; the blinatumomab; a suppression of the route 4 of cytokine signalling, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the other hand, they may cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, careful use of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids has been recommended for a short period of time for patients with COVID-19 in a critical state.
At the date of this analysis, no efficacy of antiviral therapy has been established.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously to a U.S. patient with COVID-19, has been demonstrated.
Reddesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other single-chatenary RNA viruses, such as MERS and SARS.
On the basis of these, Gilead has provided the component to China to carry out a couple of tests in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation of the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, hepatic damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of patients recovered and antibody generation
The extraction of blood from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not contract the disease is not novel.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies to the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodys are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral load and a better saturation of oxygen in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this to propose the method for its large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be considered in a thorough manner.
For example, antibodies can exacerbate the immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, which may result in lethal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients in critical conditions.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat a global pandemic.
It is therefore more important and practical to isolate the cells B from the patients recovered and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to the MCT theories.
Most of the components are still unknown or inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, it was determined that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China that used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the Province of Hubei, which used the CCT in only about 30% of their patients with COVID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (MO) treatment only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the times needed for recovery of body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
What is more surprising is that the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MCT continues to await more well-controlled trials at higher levels and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to determine the effective components of the treatment of the MCT or its combinations to be possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 are generally very afraid of highly contagious and even fatal disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the side effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
The tracking of contacts and compulsory quarantine, as part of public health responses to the outbreak of COVID-19, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine and stigma on their relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be given to patients with COVID-19, people with suspicion and people in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between individuals.
They are essential effective vaccines to interrupt the transmission chain of infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible guests, and they usually complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to generate powerful and long-term neutralising antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with live viruses attenuated in animal models for SARS have been evaluated.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these possible vaccines in older people and models of lethal stimulation and their protection against infection by viruses of zoonotic origin should be determined before a clinical study is started.
This is probably due to the expiry of SARS 17 years ago and no new cases have been recorded since then.
On the other hand, there are still cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadicly in the Middle East that are spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the current pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of the coronary viruses.
As it is a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can be recovered gradually without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a forecast model for the disease is essential for health agencies to be able to prioritise their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for SARS forecast, which is also correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of these patients were over 50 years of age in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required more intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably larger than those who did not require them (with mean age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a predictive factor of the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with positive ACE2 colangiocytes, which may cause hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are highly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: Reactive protein C (PCR) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and have been proposed as a potential predictive factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
In addition, the correlation between the PCR level and the severity and predictive of COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, a high level of dehydrogenase lactate (LDH), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), aminotransferase alanine (ALT) and cinease creatinine (CK) can also help predict patient development.
These enzymes are strongly expressed in several organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when the tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they constitute traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest radiography and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other symptoms for the prediction of clinical decompositions and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
As the use of high doses of corticosteroids in patients with severe SARS was extended, many survivors developed atrial osteonecrosis with permanent inability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period of time in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: as described earlier, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as in general they endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and attended the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to replication on lower respiratory pathways, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively replicationd on upper respiratory pathways and cause mild or no symptoms at the early stage of infection, as happens with other coronal viruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, early-stage or incubation infected patients may produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while the transmission was mostly not occurring at the early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Major efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and cities in the surrounding areas and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population with the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures are causing considerable economic and other damage, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the deceleration of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will have ended by March and the descending phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., believed that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharynx exudations in patients who had recovered and left hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a similar cyclical episode to influenza.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
Originally it is predicted that the ebola would cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, by means of a quarantine and strict isolation, the disease has been controlled.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is weakened in terms of infectivity and is eventually eradicated or turned into a less pathogenic virus that co-exists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS is given below (fig. 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitable through the toes or toes, and possibly also through direct contact with contaminated materials with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the faeces, which raises a new possibility of oral fecal transmission.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 medical care providers.
Therefore, care should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even passers-by with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with a breather N95 (series number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the fluid drops of a potentially infected person from being transmitted by air or to the surfaces from where they could be transmitted to other persons.
However, only the N95 (series number 1860) masks can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virions can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measures about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, medical care providers should use N95 (series number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical care providers should use isolation bats to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor infected himself with SARS-CoV-2 despite using a mask N95; it is possible that the virus has entered his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, medical care providers should also use transparent protective plates or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash hands with more disinfectant soaps than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet are considered to be an appropriate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused major warning in China for its experience with SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control calmed citizens saying that the new virus had a low level of contagion and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message released a notable public alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical time was taken up to contain the disease at the minimum level in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and make decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious in making public announcements, as each word is important to citizens and may change their attitude or decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for the formal reports of doctors or officials; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a possible epidemic in their early stages, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) be more regular in implementing adapted and effective simulations to raise public awareness about epidemic diseases and test and improve the response system of society periodically.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, China and some 50 more countries around the world have been spreading throughout the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the feeling of reappearance of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young people and more men than women, and severity and mortality are also greater in older people than in young people.
SARS has greater mortality than COVID-19 (10.91 % versus 1.44 %).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus although they do not present symptoms, while patients with SARS generally do so when they are seriously ill, which creates a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular ARN testing for SARS-CoV-2 may negatively occur in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, healed patients can give positive results in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the spread of the virus.
Given the rapid progress made in the COVID-19 investigation, a number of important issues remain to be addressed, such as:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronaviruses similar to SARS, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from musculoskeletal agents.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original guest, say, the murceliacians, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, it is not possible to effectively stop transmission, and the outbreak can occur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 joins the ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also join the cells expressing ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to obtain a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while transmitted between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it be extinguished as SARS or will it be resurgence periodically as influenza?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to find answers to these and many others.
However, whatever it takes, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Zoonotic origins of human coronation viruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the coercion of the coronary viruses and their guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronal viruses caused mild diseases, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly human coronation can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 put crown viruses in the centre of attention again and surprised us with a high transmissibility and reduced pathogenity compared to your brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronation is a zoonose infection and it would be useful for us to know the zoonotic origins of human coronation.
Most human coronation viruses have their origin in mosquitoes, in which they are not pathogens.
It is also known the mid-term reserve guests of some human coronation viruses.
Identifying animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Research into the interactions between coronavirus and animal guests could also provide important information on human coronavirus pathogens.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the knowledge that exists about the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as on their zoonotic origins and on the transmission between species.
Notably, we compare and contrast the different human coronal viruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful guest changes and the implications of the development of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of positive monochatenary RNA virus with envelope.
These viruses, which host the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among the RNA viruses, were called "coronavirus" because of its morphology, because of the form of coronation they have under an electronic microscope.
As for its structure, the coronavirus has non- segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
About two thirds of the genome contain two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into replica polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spiga (S) of the round (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific protein accessories of each line are also encoded by different coronavirus lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, crown viruses are classified into four genres (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus), including the betacoronavirus type containing most of the human coronary viruses and subdivided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
The phylogenetic evidence has shown that musculoskeletal and rodents are the source of genes of most alpha-coronavirus and beta-coronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus.
For thousands of years, crown viruses have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
So far, seven human coronation viruses are known.
Among them, HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronaviruses are HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe respiratory tract infection in a relatively higher number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, which cause autolimited symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 is one of the most devastating in the current history and infected more than 8000 people, with a crude lethality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a persistent epidemic in the Arab Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronation virus 2019 (2019-nCoV), later called SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current epidemic of coronation virus 2019 (COVID-19), which has been collected for more than 3120 lives and has infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronary viruses in the murceliacs, in which viruses are well adapted and not pathogens, but present great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Traceing the zoonotic origins of human coronation viruses provides a framework for understanding natural history, impulse force and the constraints of the jump between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reserve and mid-term animal guests and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have significant implications for the prevention of future proliferation.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogen of human coronary viruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that the parental viruses of human coronal viruses are usually not pathogens in their natural reservoir guests, but become pathogens after the transmission of species to a new guest.
We also look at the trend of human coronational viruses, in which the increase in transmissibility usually leads to a decrease in pathogenesis.
The evolution of the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also analysed in this context.
The coronation of animal viruses has been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCV-229E strain B814 from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had isolated themselves in various infected animals, such as the pope, the mouse, the cow, the pig, the cat and the dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronation viruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discoveries of human chronaviruses in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first HPOV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory pathways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and was subsequently adapted to grow in cell lines WI-38 of the lung.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had symptoms of common cold, such as headache, dizziness, general nausea and throat pain, with fever and cough in 10~20 % of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 was isolated from the cultivation of organs and later passed seriously into the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those of HCV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A and rhinovirus viruses.
Both HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 are distributed by the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in stormy climates.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a period of disease of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had a serious infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", caused the first pandemic caused by a well documented human coronation virus in the history of humanity, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronation virus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 cases reported with 774 deaths and spread by many countries and continents.
Apart from the super-suppliers, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with a 4-7-day incubation period and maximum viral load on the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general malaise and chills, followed by dysnea, cough and difficulty breathing such as late symptoms.
Lymopenia, altered hepatic function and high level of quinase creatinine are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Dilute alveolar damage, the proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory care.
In addition to the lower respiratory pathways, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tube, liver and kidney, can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a storm of cytokines, which could be fatal, particularly in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-air lung biopsy of a family of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronal viruses.
The HCV-NL63 was isolated from a child of 7 months from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of corsis, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from an 8-month-old infant with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed by the world.
It has been estimated that HCV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
The HCV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as Crop.
In the same year, the HCV-HKU1 isolated itself from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis acquired in the community, it was reported that HCV-HKU1 was associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four human coronation viruses acquired in the community have adapted well to humans and, in general, they are less likely to change to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown causes, such as in the rarest case of a more virulent HCV-NL63 subtype, which has recently been reported to have caused serious respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these human coronation viruses acquire the ability to transmit effectively and continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
The MERS-CoV isolated itself for the first time in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the laboratory originate from the Middle East, cases have been recorded with occasional accounting for close contacts in several European and Tunisia countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which has so far only been given with MERS among diseases caused by human coronation virus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases were recorded in the laboratory, with a high mortality of 34.4 %, which makes the MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for the people known.
From mid to late December 2019, conglomerates were detected of patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, who were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the current outbreak of infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-CoV-2 an emergency of public health of international importance and also named COVID-19.
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross fatality of 3,4 %.
Significantly, lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes serious respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, cough and dysnea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a 82% high nucleotide sequence homology, they are categorised in different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
The SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but more transmitable compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread worldwide.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronation viruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the period of incubation and the duration of the course of human coronary disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronation viruses.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between the SARS-CoV and the four human coronation viruses acquired in the community (i.e. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection presents characteristics that are most commonly observed in human coronation virus infections acquired in the community, including the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, there is also a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 as happens with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting characteristic patterns of both human coronation viruses acquired in the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronation viruses acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases between humans, as happens with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronation viruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faeces.
If the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it still needs to be resolved in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could show seasonality, as is the case of human coronation viruses acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable human-step propagation, will have an influence on the final release of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
The four human kronaviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human crown viruses.
In other words, they could both be survivors of old human chronovirus pandemics.
Human coronation viruses that cause serious human diseases and human diseases that have developed serious human coronation diseases have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, human coronation viruses must be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the guest's restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more infected people, the more likely it will be to adapt completely to humans.
If properly adapted, its transmission to humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other measures to control the infection.
For many years, the four kronaviruses acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and highly pathogenic MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to human targets that are susceptible, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifier guests.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four human coronation viruses acquired in the community.
It is highly communicable as human coronation viruses acquired in the community, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than human coronation viruses acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and will circulate among humans without an animal guest from a reservoir or intermediate.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human crown viruses, it will be useful for us to examine the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and human crown viruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary guest of a human coronation virus if it hosts a closely related ancestor who shares a high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogen in this guest.
Similarly, a guest in a reservoir houses a human coronation virus in a continuous and long-term manner.
In both cases, guests are naturally infected and are natural guests of the human coronation virus or its parental virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronation virus was introduced into the mid-term guest just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new guest and is usually pathogen.
The mid-term guest can act as the zoonotic source of the infection in humans and perform the function of an amplifier guest by allowing the virus to be transitionally replicated and then transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of the infection in humans.
A human coronation virus can cause infection in the terminal guest if it cannot sustain transmission in the intermediate guest.
On the other hand, human coronation viruses can also be adapted to the mid-term guest and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve guest.
The epidemiological data retrospectively revealed that the initial case of SARS had been in contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent studies on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to that of the general population.
Civets of masked palm trees (Paguma larvata) and a dog maple in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of viruses similar to SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were recorded after killing all the citizens of the markets.
However, it was reported that civilians of wild or unexposed pet palm trees were mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that the hidden palm trees would only act as an amplifier intermediate guest, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80 % of Guangzhou's different pets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several small mammals also act as mid-range hosts of SARS-CoV amplifiers cannot be ruled out.
All of them seem to be SARS-CoV terminal guests.
Subsequent searches by the natural animal guest of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related musculoskeletal coronation virus called CoV HKU3 of the Rhinolophus musculoskeletal carcinoma related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese herring carcinogens.
These musculoskeletal antibodies are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the sequence of the SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome.
This and other musculoskeletal crown viruses share a 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundations for the new concept that the Murcielagos host emerging pathogens in humans.
Various coronaviruses similar to SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified in musculoskeletal diseases, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) convertor enzyme is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was demonstrated that the WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of musculoskeletal agents uses the ACE2 of musculoskeletal, civet and human receptors to enter the cells.
Amazingly, patients with convalescent SARS were able to neutralize HIV1.
To date, the WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in murceliacs, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 is not the direct parental virus of SARS-CoV and that the musciellagos are not the immediate guest of the SARS-CoV reservoir.
According to the phylogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is categorised in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 musciellago and the CoV-HKU5 musciellago.
The CoV-HKU4 musculoskeletal and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptide peptidesa 4 (DPP4) for the entry of the virus.
The sequences of meRS-CoV-dependent polymerase RNAs are philogenetically closer to their beta-coronavirus counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, you can't find a live MERS-CoV in wild turtles.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 murcilegago, share a single 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, the musciellago could not be the immediate guest of the MERS-CoV reservoir.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive in neutralizing antibodies of the MERS-CoV specifically, as have the original Middle East camels in several African countries.
A live Mers-CoV identical to the virus found in humans is isolated from the nasal exudation of dromedari, which supports even more than the camels act as guests of good trust reserve of the Mers-CoV.
It should also be noted that mild symptoms were generally observed, but a massive spread of the virus in infected camels for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread the viruses not only by breathing, but also by faecal-oral means, which is also the main route of viral spread of the musculoskeletal.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have prior contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognised animal species hosting MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homologous with a coronavirus of murceloids, RatG13, isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis murceloids.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, mosquitoes may not be the immediate reserve guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the future coronavirus of practically identical mosquitoes.
It is assumed that the mid-term animal guests of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the majorist market of Juanan marines, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely event of animal transmission to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenological sequencing have suggested that a group of small mammals in danger, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangoline chronavirus share a 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RatG13, with an identity of approximately 90 % at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two lines of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a domain of association with the receptor (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an identity of 97.4% amino acid sequence.
In marked contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and RatG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
A previous study in healthy pangolines also reported viral contigo detection in lung samples, which also result in the use of SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence of approximately 86.3% of the full length viral genome.
We cannot dismiss the possibility that pangoline is one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangoline due to the sequence variance between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even lower than that between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in musculoskeletal, pangoline and other mammals still needs to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangoline, betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the convergence-mediated evolution of selectivity.
A counterproposal defends a recombination between pangoline-related beta-coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force in evolution, the recombination is extended between betacoronaviruses.
A conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronary viruses, the zoonotic origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 were also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E could have been derived from murceliac coronation viruses, while parental viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
It was reported that a coronation virus called ARCoV.2 (coronation virus of the Apalaches mountains) detected in a North American tricolor mustilage presented a close relationship with HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCV-229E was genetically related to another coral virus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although it has also been suspected of Camelids as intermediate guests.
For more clarity, the knowledge available until the time of the animal origins of known human coronation viruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human chronavirus transmission events among species in history.
When the HCV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The transmission history of HCV-229E species is not known with such accuracy.
There has been a close association of HCV-229E-related musculoskeletal alpha-coronavirus.
Among them is an alpha-coronavirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of musculoskeletal virus to humans directly.
First, unlike the alpacas, humans could have contact with the murceliacs in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Secondly, HCV-229E-related musculoskeletal alpha-coronaviruses are diverse and non-pathogens in the musculoskeletal population, while alpaca-related alpha-coronaviruses caused respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, no alpaca alfacoronavirus has been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas acquire human-related HCV-229E-related alphacoronavirus cannot be ruled out.
In fact, mosquitoes are the direct source of pathogen viruses in humans, such as the anger virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for the murceliacians to transmit the HCV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, while the alpha-coronavirus of musculoskeletal agents act as a genetic asset of the HCV-229E, alpacas and ruminants could act as intermediate guests transmitting the viruses to humans, especially in the case of the MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of the transmission between species, from turtles to rodents, and from turtles to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV in the murceliacs, is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is clear that the murcelagos contribute, with a profusion of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and great ability to fly are all favorable conditions that make the murceliacians the ideal "virus propagator".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into the dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have become an intermediate guest, to be a stable and natural reserve guest.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans continue to be a terminal guest of the MERS-CoV, since the transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolines, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangoline betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in the pangoline.
They may be a terminal guest of the beta-coronavirus-related SARS-CoV-2, as are civilians in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several transmission possibilities between species of SARS-CoV-2 animals to humans should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First of all, the mosquitoes could be the guest of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological niche with the mussels, through the slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifier guests in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Human beings contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibody study is needed in domestic and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned earlier, the re-combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that is in contact with both murceliac and pangoline.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating the cross-border crossing of species.
First, its relatively high mutation rates in the replication of the RNA.
Compared to other single-chatenary RNA viruses, the estimated rates of mutation of the coronavirus could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, according to the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new guests.
Coronaviruses have a read-only exorribonuclease, whose elimination results in extremely high metabolism and attenuation or even inviability.
Curiously, it is known that the nucleotide analogue remdesivir suppresses the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and NARN-dependent polymerase.
Reddesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of the coronary viruses are about a million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the rate of mutation is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the guest.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the exchange rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is to be hoped that it has already adapted to another guest close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, it is unlikely that the genetic derivative will cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose its effectiveness quickly.
Secondly, the long DNA genome of the coronavirus exercises additional plasticity in changing the genome for mutations and recombination and thus increases the probability of interspecies coexistence, which makes for the emergence of new coronavirus when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the unique open reading frameworks and the functions of the proteins encoded towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses change randomly and frequently from templates during the replication of the RNA through a unique "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a guest acting as a mixing vehicle, the chain change occurs frequently during the transcription of the coronary DNA.
Full-length and highly homologous subgenomial RNAs could be recombined to generate new coronavirus.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43, as well as in animal coronation viruses, such as the SL-CoV of Murciellago and the CoV-HKU9 of Murcielago.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences the transmission of species.
Currently, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed positive selection evidence in inter-species transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolated strains of human SARS-CoV and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV is rapidly adapting to different guests, in particular with mutations in the protein S RBD.
In general, the S protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is extensively selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment that binds to human ACE2 and its antiviral receptors.
The SARS-CoV RBD is capable of recognising the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including musculoskeletal, civet, mouse and maple dog, which allows transmission between virus species.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from human and civet isolate strains in the RBD and 4 of them are found in the association of the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV of civets has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of the spigot protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two substitutions of amino acids could be essential for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30 % difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit implies that the affinity of protein S with human ACE2 could have been altered.
In fact, an electronic crimicroscopic study indicates the affinity of this union 10 to 20 times greater than that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV's S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other corrigendum might be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, the HCV-NL63 also joins the ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronary receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCV-229E and 9-O-acetylated silica in HCV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronary viruses in humans, after transmission between species from their animal guests.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of the transmission of human coronation viruses among species is also determined by other factors of the guest's dependence and restriction.
The diversity of these guest proteins between humans and natural reserve guests of human coronation viruses, such as mosquitoes, rodents and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to the transmission of species.
Human kronaviruses must absorb the guest's dependency factors and subvert the guest's restriction factors so that the interspecies transmission is successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
An objective research of the full genome of the guest's dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 could be useful using advanced CRISPR technology.
New Human Coronaviruses: We're starting at zero
The diversity of coral viruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronation viruses.
In this sense, the coronaviruses of mosquitoes act as the genetic collection of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also stimulate the development of human coronary viruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein encoder genes has the potential to dramatically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory SARS-CoV proteins, it has been considered that ORF8 is important in the adaptation to humans, as virus of musculoskeletal viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but it was determined that different ORF8 proteins were encoded.
A total of 29 carnivorous carnivorous carnivorous carnivorous carnivorous agents were found in isolated strains at the start of the human epidemic.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes guest change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has potential recombination history with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, which identified a large number of smaller recombinant regions in the NARN-dependent polymerase.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the epidemiological MERS-CoV suffered recombination events between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronation viruses, in which human coronation viruses are recombined with other animal coronation viruses in their non-structured genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting in the release of the virus from the selection pressure, for example by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a complete length ORF4 in the HCV-229E prototype strain due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although an ORF4 intact in HCV-229E-related musculoskeletal and camel virus could be observed, the alpha-coronavirus of alpacas has an insertion of a single nucleotide, causing a change in the framework.
Finally, although not least important, the evolution of new human coronation viruses is also driven by the selection pressure in their reserve guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when coronavirus musculoskeletal infections were detected, indicating mutual adaptation between coronavirus and musculoskeletal disorders.
The musculoskeletal system appears to be well adapted to the anatomical and physiological coronaviruses.
For example, failure to activate the pro-inflammatory response in the musculoskeletal system effectively reduces the pathology caused by the coronary viruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in musculoskeletal cells is eliminated due to the positive regulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of Class I molecules in the larger histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of musculoskeletal agents could suppress the replication of the coronation virus and affect the reading test of exorribonuclease, leading to the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new guest.
More pathogenic crown virus strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for guest adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new human coronation viruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir guests, such as mosquitoes and camels.
They are strongly replicated without causing a strong immune response from the guest.
In this, the secret is why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes serious cases of infection in humans.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and the storm of cytokines, in which the stronger the immune response, the more serious the lung damage.
On the other hand, in the asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy for deboning the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong in the musculoskeletal glands.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early stage of human SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 in musculoskeletal inflammation is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the appearance of SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV.
Although a 95 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been found, a 96 % nucleotide homologous coronation with SARS-CoV-2 has also been found.
Although it has been determined that citizens and other animals on the market are hosting the same SARS-CoV virus, no immediate interim guests of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Betacoronaviruses from prominently homologous pangolines to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests or that pangoline betacoronaviruses could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is done by man, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have recovered the protagonist due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of crown viruses in mosquitoes and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human crown viruses in human transmission.
Vasta evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in the murcelilags and are transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between people and civilians in the markets, close the wet markets and kill the civilians in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangoline should be withdrawn from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several pangoline betacoronavirus lines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals remains to be resolved in future investigations.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed by the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with the markets of wild animals to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other measures to control the infection.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks could appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronary viruses, they are circulating in wild state.
In particular, crustaceans with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are great possibilities for these zoonotic coronation viruses to evolve and recombinate, resulting in the emergence of new coronation viruses that are more transmissible or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan of preparation and response should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity to spread is presented.
Although mosquitoes have many features that promote the spread of viruses, human contact with mosquitoes and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to get away from them.
The continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the coronavirus and its natural guests, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep humans away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, if the bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolines, it will be interesting to examine the circumstances under which bats and pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role to play in human transmission, it must be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate guest, it must be resolved how it interacts with the different species, including humans, turtles and penguins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether a mosquito, a pangoline or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical are expected to be identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continued research in this area will resolve the evolving route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with significant implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guidance guide for the diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new crownvirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guide included our experience and is a good reference to combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (CVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and our knowledge gradually increase on the basis of the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we replied to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest guidelines for the Diagnostic and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Committee on Health of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a outbreak, which is now officially known as coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and the virus was named coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
He's been paying a lot of attention ever since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and our knowledge gradually increase on the basis of the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the CVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our director received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple classification proposal based on his clinical experience.
His work has added new evidence for our direction and is also a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support his important work and express our appreciation.
However, your work also needs update according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnostic and Treatment of COVID-19 (Seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm a suspicious case it is necessary to combine any point of the characteristics of epidemiological background with two points of clinical manifestations to perform an exhaustive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations must be performed if there are no clear epidemiological backgrounds:
Epidemiological background: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with evidence of positive nucleic acid); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases of fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas such as house, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics of COVID-19 infection images; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte count at the early start stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspect case with any characteristic of pathic or serological evidence as follows: (1) test of positive real-time polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the complete viral genome that shows high homogeneity to newly recognised new coronavirus; (3) positive result for the specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change of the specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or an increase of title ≥4 times in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory pathways was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions.
The detection of pathogens in blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological tests were added to the seventh edition.

In addition, there is increasing evidence that we should be careful with patients with atypical asymptomatic and symptomatic symptoms.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. flow chart should be updated as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we expect more direct evidence to emerge and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected case" and "confirmed case", we recommend to seek and comply with the newest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guide in a timely manner to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the largest in one day
Bangladesh confirmed yesterday five new deaths due to COVID-19 in one day.
It's the greatest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
At an online briefing, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the victims were four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were more than 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were Daca.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
One hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, to whom they were serving at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an on-line video announcement, the Minister of Transport by Road and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, said public transport would be suspended for longer than originally planned until next Saturday.
This public transport suspension had started initially on 26 March and was expected to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, were two men who returned from Italy and also women from one of them.
As of March 19, these three had already been recovered.
More than one million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The hit took place the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first death related to the coronavirus.
North Korea stated on Thursday that it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), dated 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus related to at least 5900 deaths were reported.
CBS News reported, quoting data from the University of Johns Hopkins, that on Wednesday there were more than 1000 deaths in the United States caused by coronary infections.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's closure until 1 May.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to receive their salaries without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency state for 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes to ten, with one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended the falls in the holy cities of La Meca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the fall was only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
Thailand planned to implement a fall between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until 1 May.
Supermarkets in Australia lower the limits of health paper by transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, the Australian Woolworths and Coles supermarket chains lowered their hygiene paper purchase limits to two and a transaction package in all of the country's supermarkets, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These restrictions were published as messages on the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers were reportedly falling for fear of COVID-19 if people had to self-inflicted.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of hygiene paper to deliver home to a package on request.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of 8 March, reported that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets are still exhausting the product within an hour of delivery", and said that the demand "had no precedent", while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
The sales went up with a "force increase" last week, according to a Woolworth voice.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To alleviate the scarcity even more, Coles requested larger packages from the suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a special offer of Wednesday scheduled with anticipation.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that minors are trying to increase their lives, but the restrictions of local counciling on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets could not make the special offer on Wednesday.
In a report at News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail sales expert at the University of Technology of Queensland, said that supermarkets supply stocks every night.
He stressed that the hygiene role is a voluminous article, which causes a low number of stocks in numbers, and, when exhausted, leaves a large void in the barns, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Colles and Woolworths have the idea of [that] if there was an abundant amount of the article in the barns, if products such as toilet and disinfectant rolls could [purchase] and there were large amounts, the panic would probably be minimized, Russell Zimmerman said by ABC News.
The recycled health paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said last Wednesday that the stocks were exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the Kleinex hygiene paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, pointed out that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain supply, according to the report at News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property vendors offered free health role to the first bidder in the auctions in Melbourne, when less auctions were made because the buyers had free time on the weekend of the Day of the Worker.
The publication of Thursday's NT News, a daily published in Darwin, included an eight-page leaflet designed to be cut and used as a hygiene paper.
Supermarkets initially showed reactions to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia of 3 March, in which they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the UK online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of the toilet paper Andres to two 12-wheel packages.
World Health Organization declared pandemic of COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "pandemia" refers only to the extent of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage Governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO, said.
We are very concerned about both the alarming levels of proliferation and gravity and the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic "has no precedents".
In statements published by CNN in February, he said, "In addition to the influence, no other respiratory virus has been traced from appearance to continued worldwide spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion and said "we've never seen a pandemic caused by a crown virus before".
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic situation arose after the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak an emergency of public health of international importance.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it will get worse".
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The pandemic of coronavirus 2019–20 is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and was recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97 000 deaths were reported as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
It was estimated that the mortality rate per case was 4 per cent in China, while worldwide it ranged between 13.04 per cent in Algeria and 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include acute respiratory difficulty pneumonia and syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic therapy and support. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping away from other people and controlling and self-inflicted people who are suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world responded through the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, drop-offs, workplace hazard controls and closures.
The pandemic led to a serious global socio-economic change, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies aggravated by panic-motivated purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world ' s student population.
Wrong information on the virus was disseminated via the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and other areas with significant virus cases.
Due to the reduction of heavy industry travel and closures, there was a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Wuhan, China, (the capital of the Province of Hubei) reported a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and in early January 2020 an investigation was initiated.
In most cases, it was related to the majorist market for Juanan marines, so it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the crown viruses of the musculoskeletal glands, the crown viruses of the pangoline and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person suspected of symptoms was infected on December 1, 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the last group of wet market.
From the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was determined that two thirds had a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified South China Morning Post report suggested that a 55-year-old person in Hubei Province might have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases, according to the reports, decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and 19-year-olds and younger persons represented 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK’s chief scientific adviser, believed that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases relate to the number of persons who have been tested for COVID-19 and who have obtained a positive result confirmed in accordance with official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had performed tests in more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies not to perform tests on people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China, until 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States found that it could be of 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time spent from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most frequent 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths were persons over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular and diabetes diseases. Official records of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to the deceased persons who gave positive results in the COVID test, according to official protocols.
The number of real deaths caused by COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not be included in people who died without evidence, for example in their homes, in the homes of elders, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of deaths by COVID in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) voice admitted "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is a underestimation", a statement corroborated by the U.S. sub-county anecdotal reports. This underestimation is common in pandemics, as in the H1N1 swine influenza pandemic of 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside continental China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
As of 28 February, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside continental China in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, in all continents except Antarctica, and a number of indicators were generally used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time spent from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths over cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the global proportion of deaths in cases is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, mortality estimates for cases decreased from 17.3 % (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 % (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the mortality rate per case, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed with disease deaths and the mortality rate for infections, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died because of a disease.
These statistics do not have a specific deadline and consider a specific population from the infection to the resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the mortality rate for pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the fatality rate per case.
WHO states that pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary according to location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania indicated, "Infectious outbreaks, if they are not controlled, usually stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease remains unavailable.
But, at this moment, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen."
The main medical adviser of the Government of China, Zhong Nanshan, argued that it could "end in June" if all countries could be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that SARS-CoV-2 "will remain circulating, possibly for one or two years".
According to the study of Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronary virus, given that it is transmitted so easily, disappears completely" and "it could become a seasonal disease, which reappears every year."
The virulence of reappearance would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dryness (68%).
The most common symptoms include fatigue, exposure to respiratory tract (flema), loss of sense of breath, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pressure or persistent pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and blue in the face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended. The greatest advance of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory difficulty syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, not presenting clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, therefore the investigators advised that those with close contact with infected persons should be monitored and examined carefully in order to discard the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic individuals range from slightly to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) covers one to 14 days; it is more often 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease is spread mainly during the close contact and through the small drops that occur when it is tossing, snorting or talking; the close contact is considered to be 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, when tossing without covering the mouth, droplets can be moved from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated when talking. Respiratory drops can also occur during exhalation, even when talking, although usually the virus is not transmitted by air.
The drops can enter the mouth or nose of people who are close to them or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary animation (RCP), can cause air-solve respiratory secretions and therefore air propagation.
It can also be spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then it touches the eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through the facts, it is believed that this risk is low.
The Government of China denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of the symptoms, although the spread may be possible before the symptoms and at more advanced stages of the disease are detected.
People obtained positive results in the tests of the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms are developed.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but some countries have identified an asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that although it is not completely clear the ease with which the disease is spread, usually one person is infected with two or three others. The virus survives from day to day on the surface.
Specifically, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed in pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to human beings, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other areas that could have affected infected persons.
The coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the acute respiratory disease group in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are in the coronation viruses related to nature. Outside of the human body, the virus dies when in contact with soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
He's believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgeno sarbicovirus (line B) together with two strains derived from the musculoskeletal system.
At the level of the complete genome, 96 % is identical to other samples of murcilega coronation virus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the sequences of the genome between pangoline viruses and human beings.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that the pangoline coronary and SARS-CoV-2 share a maximum of 92% of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that pangoline is the intermediate guest.
The virus infection can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although, ultimately, it is confirmed through the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computerized tomography images.
According to a Wuhan study comparing polymerase chain reaction to computerized tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "do not use computerized tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with inverse real-time transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed in blood or respiratory samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually carried out with a nasopharyngeal hyope, although it can also be used for throat. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these demonstrated to be accurate enough to approve their widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic features in the images of computerized radiographs and tomographs (TC) of symptomatic individuals include asymmetric peripheral glass opacitys and absence of pleural spills.
The Italian Radiology Society is compiling an online international database of results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to the overposition with other infections such as adenovirus, the diagnosis of images without confirmation by polymerase chain reaction has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A comprehensive study conducted in China compared the results of chest Computed Tomography with the results of polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although the diagnosis of images is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect the characteristics of the virus in images, both with radiography and with computerized tomography.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include keeping a good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without washing them before, and shaking or coughing on a disposable panel and throwing the panel directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who could already be infected use a surgical mask in public.
Physical remoteness measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have restricted or disassociated all non-essential travels from and to countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that health care providers who treat someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. The tracking of contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent more transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments for this purpose has generated concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on respectful privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they are in close contact with someone who gave positive results in the COVID-19 test. They are circulating wrong ideas about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal lavage and mouthwashing tanks are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDCs recommend that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when they have their hands clearly dirty; before eating and after sounding the nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is due to the fact that outside the human body, the virus dies when in contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
CDCs also recommended the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant with at least 60 % of alcohol in volume when water and soap are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without washing them before.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after exposure to the disinfectant in a stainless steel surface), including ethanol to 62–71 %, isopropanol to 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite to 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide to 0,5 % and povidone to 0,2–7,5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate chlorhexidine, are less effective.
CDCs recommend that, if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or office, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and automatic cases used by sick people are disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a flexed code or with a removable towel to touch or scratch, and that they immediately discard the panel.
It is recommended that those who could be infected use surgical masks, as the use of a mask may limit the volume and distance of the respiratory drops that spread when speaking, shaking and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Using a mask can reduce the [of] people's tendency to touch their face, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene". The use of masks in people who care for someone who might have the disease has also been recommended.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they run a high risk, for example those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to promote the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., CDCs recommend using non-medical masks made of fabric. China specifically recommended the use of removable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or to be in competing places.
Thailand's health officials recommend that people make textile masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited public spaces from leaving without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that all people use a mask while in public spaces to protect themselves and protect others.
The Austrian Government demanded the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use masks in public.
Taiwan, which has made ten million masks a day since mid-March, demanded the use of masks by passengers on trains and coaches on April 1.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to get out of the open air, while it also recommends the manufacture of masks made at home to those who cannot buy them.
The masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes measures to control the infection designed to prevent the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centers.
People can implement social distance methods when staying in their homes, limit travel, avoid competing areas, use forms of health that do not include contact and physically distance from other people.
Many Governments now demand or recommend social distance in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by government agencies and health organizations in the United States was rapidly reduced from 250 persons (if no known spread of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 persons, and then to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Major adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and compromised immune systems have a greater risk of suffering serious diseases and complications, and CDCs recommend staying in their homes as much as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distance" by "physical distance", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, whether virtual or distance.
The use of the term "social distance" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt full social isolation instead of encouraging them to stay in touch with others through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
They include recommendations that you only have sexual relations with a person you live with, that you do not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-infliction was recommended in the home of those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of having been infected.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on proper self-restraint. Many Governments have demanded or recommended the self-quantity of entire populations in the affected areas.
The more stringent instructions on self-quanten were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
Persons who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quantity for 14 days since the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling a outbreak are retention or suppression and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the first stages of the outbreak and is intended to identify and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other measures to control infection and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are shifted to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to stop the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of restraint and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The removal requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves attempting to reduce the epidemimal peak, which is known as the spread of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of collapse of health services and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-quantenine; community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closing schools and cancelling mass competition events; community commitment to promoting acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures and cleaning of surfaces. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak once its severity was evident, for example, the implementation of quarantines in entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented massive detection and quarantine assessments, and issued alerts on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who decided to do quarantine and imposed great fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and penalized the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which reduces the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for medical care in two thirds and death to half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapse of health systems.
The removal may be preferred, but it must be maintained throughout the time the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), because, on the contrary, transmission is rapidly reactivated when measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medicines approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing medicines.
Taking free selling medicines for the cold, drink liquids and rest can help relieve the symptoms.
According to severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes increased capacity and adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a key measure of response to outbreaks.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have formulated guidelines for primary medical hospitals and services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 tests, canceling optional procedures where possible, separating and isolating patients from positive patients in COVID-19 and increasing intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of breathers and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case could have originated (the so-called zero patient).
The first case known as the new crown virus can be recovered as of 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei increased gradually.
These were mainly linked to the majorist marine market in Huaan, which also sold live animals, and a theory is that the virus comes from one of these animals; or, in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a series of cases of unknown cause pneumonia were observed by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei's Provincial Hospital, who informed Jianghan's CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan's Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "sars-like coronavirus".
The police pointed to eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was arrested by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
In early January, sufficient cases of unknown cause pneumonia were reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases was doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to the migration for the New Year of China and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre and an important railway crossing.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data show that, as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States has exceeded China and Italy with the largest number of cases confirmed worldwide. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97 000 people have died and more than 364,000 have been recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included detention measures, such as quarantines (known as home orders, local or bordering refugee orders) and drop-outs. On 2 April, about 300 million people, or approximately 90 per cent of the population, comply with some type of border in the United States, more than 50 million people are in the Philippines, about 59 million are in South Africa and 13 billion are in India.
As of 26 March, 17 billion people around the world have achieved some kind of restraint, which increased to 26 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and his hospital informed Jianghan's CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
WHO was informed the same day.
While these notifications were being carried out, the police warned doctors in Wuhan about "defending rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially stated that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission between humans.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "popular War", to contain the spread of the virus.
What was described as "the greatest quarantine in the history of humanity", on January 23, was announced a health cord prohibiting travel within and outside Wuhan, which extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
The New Year's celebrations (25 January) were canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, the Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities to Wuhan, such as convention and stadium centres, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented more measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, which included the issuance of health declarations for travellers and the extension of the spring holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions implemented several measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions within and outside Hubei were implemented.
Public transport was changed and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
The control of the public movement was implemented in several cities, and it was estimated that some 760 million people (over half the population) faced some type of restrictions on outdoor exits. Following the beginning of the global outbreak phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, only one case had been transmitted at the national level in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases transmitted at national level was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, were flexible two months after the restriction was imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that visa holders' income or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details of when this policy will end.
Those wishing to enter China should request visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Government of China encouraged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for signatures. The Council of State declared a day of mourning to begin with a time of national silence from 3 minutes April to 10 a.m., meeting with the Qingming Festival, although the Central Government asked families to submit their respect online to comply with the physical distance in order to avoid the revocation of the COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On 20 February, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, attributed mainly to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9336 church members, 1261 or about 13% reported symptoms. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the highest alert.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on 28 February, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All the military bases in South Korea remained in quarantine after the evidence confirmed that three soldiers had given positive results for the virus.
The airline schedules were also affected, and therefore changed. South Korea presented what was considered the world's widest and best-organized programme to test the detection of the virus in the population and isolate infected persons, as well as identify and put in quarantine those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newly arrived persons from other countries through mobile application, driving-thru centres to perform virus detection tests with results available the following day and increasing diagnostic capacity to be able to test up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting the quarantine in entire cities. South Korea's society was initially polarized with regard to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand Moon ' s resignation, which they considered to be a mishandling by the Government, or rather, to commend their response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had total cases on a lower day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April, all newly arrived persons from outside should remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for assistance for virus testing in 121 different countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that same day.
The early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday's prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran destined five billion rials to fight the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said there was no plan to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that it would only be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the New Persian Noworuz year continued.
The Chiese shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became a post-China virus spread centre.
More than ten countries had tracked their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March, 23 of its 290 members reported that they had obtained positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian penitentiary authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissidenty, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there was a greater risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lacked adequate medical attention.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the largest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As of 17 March, at least 12 expoliators or politicians in the Iranian exercise had died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes because of the crown virus.
According to a WHO official, Iran may have five times as many cases as reported.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran could be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to viral outbreaks.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the relief of economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists gave positive results in the SARS-CoV-2 trials in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, leading the Italian Government to suspend all flights from and to China and to declare the state of emergency.
Later, a group of non-related COVID-19 cases were detected, which began with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree to contain the outbreak, which included placing in quarantine more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "You will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.

On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Reimimation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations on the screening protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy beat China as the country with the largest number of coronavirus-related deaths worldwide after reporting 3405 deaths by pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, 128,948 cases were confirmed, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, and most of those cases occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that Italy's combination of a large age population and the inability to test all people with the virus to date could contribute to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the first virus emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any kind of social or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism of the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to the concerns faced by the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he discouraged social contact and all non-essential trips, suggesting that people work from their homes when possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced the early closure of all leisure facilities, such as bars and gymnasiums, and promised to pay up to 80 per cent of workers' salaries up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent social distance measures, which prohibited meetings of more than two persons and restricted travel and activities to those considered strictly necessary.
Unlike previous measures, the police could require compliance with these restrictions through the imposition of fines and the dissemination of meetings.
Most companies were ordered to close except those considered "essentials", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, railways, gas stations and workshops.

Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start in carrying out tests, which concealed the true magnitude of the outbreak at that time.
Tests were carried out by defective test kits produced by the Federal Government in February, the lack of approval by the Federal Government of test kits from non-governmental (academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February and the restrictive criteria for individuals to qualify for a test until the beginning of March (a medical order was then required).

The general approval of Trump's crisis management has been polarized among the party lines.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticized the dependence of the U.S. on the import of critical materials, including special medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of travel patterns was used to identify and predict patterns of spread and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on the information provided by the International Air Transport Association, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei in 2018, the largest number of passengers from Wuhan had.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported as popular destinations for people travelling from Wuhan.
According to information, Bali was the least-capable city among the 20 most popular cities of destination from the point of view of preparation, while the cities of Australia were considered more capable.

China's assistance, on the other hand, was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to control and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the outbreak of SARS from 2002 to 2004, when it accused the Chinese authorities of secretism that prevented efforts to prevent prevention and detention, and the current crisis, in which the central government has "provided periodic updates to avoid panic in front of the New Year's holidays".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that, although “it was definitely not a recommendation made by WHO”, it was “a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is more concentrated” and said that “there was no precedent in public health history”. On 30 January, after confirming the transmission of human beings outside China and increasing the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak of a public health emergency of international importance (ESPII), the sixth ESPII since the first call for action during the 2009 swine influenza pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that ESPII was due to "the risk of global proliferation, especially low and medium-income countries without solid health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that do not necessarily interfere with international trade and travel" and that "the WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the world community for a $675 million contribution to finance strategic preparation in low-income countries, and called for the urgent support of those countries that do not have systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, if any.
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest slab" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future". On 11 February, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros said that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to contribute the “power of the entire United Nations system in response”.
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which enabled the coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will allow them to “focus on the health response while other agencies can provide their expertise to address the social, economic and development implications of the outbreak”.
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was launched to provide international and WHO field experts in China to assist in national management and to assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with major institutions at the national level and to visit the site in order to assess the "impact of provincial and county response activities, including urban and rural environments". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of crown virus", and noted that, although it was too soon to call it pandemic, countries should still be "in a preparatory phase".
In response to a development outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation there. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global assessment of the threat of coronavirus would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement that "This is a verification of reality for all governments on the planet: Awake.
This virus can be on its way and we must be prepared," insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also said that the current data did not ensure that public health officials declared a global pandemic, and noted that this statement would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus".
On March 11, the WHO declared pandemic the outbreak of coronavirus.
The Director-General said that WHO was "very concerned about the alarming levels of proliferation and gravity, as well as the alarming levels of inaction". WHO has received important criticism as to why it is considered an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative response included the request for the resignation of the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of all persons during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts indicated that everyone had the right to save lives and that the Government had this responsibility.
The group noted that the lack of resources or medical insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts stressed that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, persons detained, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups that need government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impact of the crisis by COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, in addition to views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of bordering and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a country-by-country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a global coordinated response to the challenge of the crown virus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the Office of the United Kingdom, Michael Gove, and the son of the President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his pandemic management, which began in the province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) were dismissed because of their management of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political system to outbreaks in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger over the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example Zhao Lijian, rejected a prior recognition of the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the United States or Italy.
The administration of Donald Trump of the United States has referred to the crown virus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", and stated that "China's censorship has over-feeded a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which in turn was pointed out by some critics such as racism and "distraction" of the failure of their administration to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the U.S. Government that described a communication strategy with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and cited the strategy as "All About China".
We have been told that we are trying to deliver this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television shows. " Media such as Politician, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by the virus are part of a global campaign to get global influence.
European Union foreign policy representative Josep Borrell warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and generosity policy".
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China also requested that the United States lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sent assistance to these two countries.
On 3 April, United States sanctions blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid from other countries to their own country.
Disputes concerning masks between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and between the Czech Republic and Italy, have also been reported.
Turkey also seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of solidarity between the European Union and Italy, affected by the crown virus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said "Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged that the Russian army send military doctors, special disinfectants and other medical teams to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" that claimed that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of committing an offence of "geopolitical and diplomatic seduction".
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mayo rejected the reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that "by offering help to US colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when US manufacturers of medical materials and equipment cover impulses, they can also respond if necessary".
NATO's planned military "Defender 2020" exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be carried out on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticised the Defence 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, life is in danger not only of the United States troops and the various European countries participating, but also of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian Government was deeply affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of the infected Parliament, as well as 15 other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help and said that his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted the requirement that the United States adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, paid family license and higher levels of public health funds.
Political analysts predicted that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election possibilities in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticised Japan's "major and passive quarantine efforts", after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would remain in quarantine for two weeks in sites designated by the Government.
South Korea's society was initially polarized with regard to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed requests to demand Moon's resignation, which they considered to be a mishandling by the Government, or rather, to commend their response, and the pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that Governments might be able to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend Parliament and the elections and punish those who are considered to have disseminated false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
It was blamed for the outbreak of coronavirus in several cases of shortage of supplies, as a result of the worldwide use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and interruptions of logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Medicinal Administration has issued warnings on the lack of medicines and medical equipment due to the increased demand for consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left empty barns of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, resulting in lack of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in electronic product shipments.
According to WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment increased 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also resulted in a four to six-month delay in the supply of medical supplies.
It also caused a shortage of personal protection teams around the world, and WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food, none of these areas were affected by the acute shortage of food.
China and Italy's measures against the accumulation and illicit trade in essential products have been successful, and they have avoided a sharp shortage of food that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to industry representatives.
Food stores were empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pig meat reserves to ensure adequate food for the population.
In Italy there are similar laws requiring food producers to keep reservations for these emergencies.
The damage in the world economy was felt in China: according to a periodic report of 16 March, China's economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the Government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales dropped by 20.5%.
Since continental China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been considered a significant threat of destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the global growth epidemic could exceed those of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate of an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion in the world's supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly remained "revolving" after a strong fall in oil prices due to China's low demand.
On 24 February, world value markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside continental China.
On 27 February, due to the growing concerns about the outbreak of coronavirus, several US stockpiles, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, published their most pronounced drop since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the largest drop in one day since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with a decrease of more than 10 %.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH claimed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again on the basis of the fears of the crown virus, the biggest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is likely an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to the lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quantities, while the British regional Flybe airline crashed.
The impact on cruise companies has reached a level never before seen.
Several railway stations and transshipment terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, an important season of travel related to New Year's Chinese holidays.
Several events involving large groups were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also independently closed their tourist shops and attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many tourist events and attractions of New Year Lunar have been closed to avoid massive concentrations, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple holidays.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year ' s holiday until 10 February, and ordered most of the jobs not to be reopened until that date.
These regions account for 80% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to the highest infectious disease and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year's celebrations. The minority sector was affected globally, with reductions in time schedules or temporary closures.
Minorist visits to Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
The North American and Middle East minorities experienced a drop from 50 to 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a drop from 33% to 43% in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping centres around the world imposed additional measures, such as greater hygiene, the installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in an extreme poverty situation in Latin America than had remained in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the highest point of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were displaced in their homes in the provinces of the interior or trapped in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million U.S. workers lost their jobs and asked for government assistance.
The outbreak of coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to the estimates of the Bank of the Federal Reserve of San Luis. The border in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to Angus Reid Institute's survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some kind of unemployment. Around 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since they started the border in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit plan. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes supported by the Government, known as Kurzbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term employment compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The sectors of stage art and cultural heritage were deeply affected by the pandemic, which had an impact on the operations of organizations and on people, both employed and independent, around the world.
Cultural and arts organizations have tried to carry out their mission (often funded with public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public and support artists whenever possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and in varying degrees, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows had been cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence that increases to an accelerated rate of disease is the abolition of religious services. Important sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The cinematographic industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian prison season of Cuaresma.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of participating in the church on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live Internet or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
After the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome decided to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious agencies also canceled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the abolition of Friday's outbreaks in areas affected by the outbreak and then the sanctuaries were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant change in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the major sports events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 Champions League, the first League 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The outbreak interrupted the plans of the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to start in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will "reprogrammed for a later date than 2020 but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other places of play around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to use the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their rates of new subscriptions. The entertainment industry was also affected, several musical groups suspended or cancelled concerts.
Many big theaters, like Broadway's, also suspended all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work through the Internet as an alternative to the traditional live show, such as live concert broadcasts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet so that artists can interpret, distribute or publish their work.
On line, numerous Internet memes have been spread over the crown virus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people in Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Fear, suspicion and hostility incidents have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia and the Pacific region.
February reports (when most of the cases were still limited to China) have documented racist feelings in various groups around the world expressing that the Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered to be fair reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-cancer feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside of the virus.
Following the advance of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicions and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed requests to obtain a ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was a trend on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for referring to the crown virus as the "Chinese virus", a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chin.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign evacuations from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, who share a border with China, and who study in the main Indian cities, suffered harassment in relation to the outbreak of coronavirus.
The president of the state unit of Bharatiya Janata party in Western Bengala, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God came from them".
China's consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "erronous." In China, they increased xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and described foreigners as "foreign trash" and intended for "desire".
Many newspapers with pay walls removed them for parts or all of their coverage of the crown virus.
Many scientific editors have published scientific articles related to the available brothel with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results with preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronary disease 2019 (CVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed through the polymerase chain reaction test with reverse transcriptase, which detects the coronary DNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 DNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had too mild symptoms as to inform them or who were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence by March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had performed more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were major variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
It is also likely that this variability is significantly affecting mortality rates in reported cases, which are probably very overestimated in some countries.
Through the polymerase chain reaction with inverse real-time transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal hisopates or spout samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The response test in the polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase performed with pharynx is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In people infected with the test during the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory tract through suction catheter, or the material that is expelled from the toxin may be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time inverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), and constituted the base of the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the clinical grade polymerase chain reaction (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
Search for the "E" gene shared by all betacoronavirus and the specific RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the emergency use approval of the National Administration of Chinese Medical Products from a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their polymerase chain diagnostic panel with inverse transcriptase in real time for the new crownvirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in the previous versions of test kits generated inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and a gap in the performance of tests in the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples were successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests using two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only from that time was it allowed for the state and local laboratories to start carrying out tests.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use permit. US commercial laboratories began to test in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of COVID-19 evidence based on the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase.
Similarly, on 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made available evidence for COVID-19 at the national level.
No limits were announced on the quantity; the collection of specimens and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VectOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Care Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA for a test that could take place within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received the same authorisation for emergency use of the FDA for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using the isotermic amplification technology of nucleic acids instead of polymerase chain reaction.
Since this does not require a series of different cycles of temperature, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed that uses a monoclonal antibody that is specifically bound to the protein of the nucleocapid (protein N) of the new coronary virus, with the hope that it can provide results within a period of 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid test for influenza.
In March 2020, the publication review concluded that "Torax radiographs have little diagnostic value in the first stages, while the results of the TC [computerized tomography] can be obtained even before symptoms occur".
Typical features in the TC include multi-lobe bilateral opacitys in exposed glass with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, empedral pattern and consolidation develops.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the origin point of the current pandemic, which compared polymerase chain reaction to computerized tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "do not use computerized tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". Since March 2020, CDCs recommend polymerase chain reaction as an initial review.
Part of the immune response to the infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people about 7 days after symptoms, to determine immunity and to monitor the population. Analysis can be performed in central laboratories or through evidence at the point of attention.
Automated high-performance systems in many clinical laboratories can perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratory analysis, only one specimen of peripheral blood is usually used, although serious specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained through a puncture in the skin.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, there is no need for an extraction step prior to analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received Europe's approval for its test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional viral NARN polymerase chain reaction test.
In early April, the United Kingdom discovered that none of the antibodies test kits it bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspicious patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a sample tube", the patient spits on the tube, sends it and gets a result in a short time. British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, thus eliminating the risk that the patient will infect others if they go to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In tests at drive-through centers for suspected cases, a health professional takes appropriate precautions.
The drive-through centres have helped South Korea to do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Medicals said on 2 March that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the ambulatory environment and that 10 700 people had been tested last week.
Health insurance assumes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to perform 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, evidence was offered through the drive-through system in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first study of laboratories revealed that, in the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples had been analyzed, including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Institute of Technology and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to analyze samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of pooling samples and only do more analysis if the combined sample is positive. On 5 February 2020, in Wuhan, the BGI opened a 2000-square-metre emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese, or "Fire Eye"), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47 per cent higher and that the corresponding cost of addressing the quarantine had been doubled without this capacity for testing.
After Wuhan's laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjín, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of 4 March 2020, total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Multiple open source designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow to evaluate up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without using liquid handling robots.
In March, the shortage and insufficient amounts of reactives affected massive evidence in the European Union and the United States.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release DNA genomes to do more testing. On 31 March, it was announced that United Arab Emirates was now doing more tests of coronary detection per person in their population than any other country, and was directed to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at the level of the population of Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of response tests in the polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of the coronary virus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for making kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States was not available until 28 January, which delayed the available evidence in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia could not provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on the evidence.
On the contrary, experts say that the high availability of South Korea tests helped to reduce the spread of the new crown virus.
The South Korean Government has achieved its capacity to carry out tests, mainly in private sector laboratories, over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested an increase in testing programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays in hundreds of thousands of tests in private U.S. laboratories, and the supply of hisopates and chemical reagents was exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had avoided private testing. Spain bought test kits for the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that incorrect results could be due to incorrect sample collection or wrong use of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said it would remove the wrong results kits and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought to China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits to China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Atesz Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey bought to China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits to China, but in early April 2020 announced that they were not serving.
The carrying out of tests, supplemented by the quarantine of those who obtained positive results and the identification of those who had contacted those who had given positive results in SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vó, the place where the first death occurred by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of trials throughout the population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
About half of the people who achieved positive results had no symptoms, and all cases detected were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With the intensive tracking of contacts, restrictions on travel from outside, testing and quarantine, the pandemic by coronavirus 2020 in Singapore progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were canceled, and on 28 March Singapore began to recommend to residents who are staying in their homes, but schools reopened in time after the holiday of 23 March.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from outside, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent boundaries, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have performed more evidence in relation to the number of deaths have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries have more capacity to detect people who have only mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that have no evidence and that have national limited experience laboratories in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to any of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to perform confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 are in North America and 1 are in Australia.
In the following table, the column "positive as % of evidence" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only carries out tests on people entering hospitals will have a higher positive number than a percentage of evidence that a country that carries out tests on all citizens, whether they are symptoms or not, is the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands with a view to eliminating dirt, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The washing of hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by faecal-oral means.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as common influenza or coldness, for example, if their hands are not washed before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day in which it is important to wash hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing clothes, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If no water or soap is available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing the meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing clothes or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After sounding your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, food for animals or animal waste.
Hand medical hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause a disease) and chemicals that may cause damage or diseases.
This is especially important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many benefits for health, including minimising the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in births at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that improvements in hand washing practices can generate small improvements in the growth rate of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhea diseases can be reduced by introducing simple changes in behaviour, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action may reduce the mortality rate for these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes in about a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of the decreases in diarrhea episodes can be related to the washing of hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the most effective and economic way to prevent acute diarrhea and respiratory infections, such as automatic behaviour adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
pneumonia, an important acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year are charged.
Diarrhoea and joint pneumonia represent almost 3.5 million children's deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, converting hand washing with soap before eating and after using the bath in a rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce almost half the deaths per diarrhea and one quarter the deaths of acute respiratory infections.
In general, hand washing is integrated with other interventions in the field of hygiene as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against impetio, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that your frequent realization can cause skin damage due to skin dryness.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hand washing can cause skin disease that causes itching and makes the skin become known as an eczema of the hands or dermatitis of the hands, which is especially common in health workers.
The washing of hands too often is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the oral-fetal transmission of the diseases: after using the bathroom (orientate, defecate), after cleaning a child's tail (change your clothes), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other occasions in which proper hand washing techniques must be practiced to prevent transmission of diseases include before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after shaking, coughing or ringing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hands washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced hands washing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97%; the United States was close to half with 77%; and China had the lowest rate of 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behavior, to increase the habit of washing hands with soap at critical times. Hand washing in groups of children at school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate hand washing in the behavior of children.
The "Essential Health Care Programme" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of a measure of action to promote the health and education of children.
Disperse twice a year, in addition to washing hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of the microorganisms from the skin improves by adding soap or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
The water alone is ineffective to clean the skin because the fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in the water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of contaminated solid soap bacteria concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as bacteria are inflamed with foam.
Even so, the CDCs say "it is preferable to use the liquid soap with controls for dispensing that do not involve the use of hands".
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly promoted to a conscious public of health.
At present, there is no evidence that the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics are used to preserve organisms resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve the strains resistant to antibiotics, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surfactant agent that protects the skin, sophisticated formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon's School of Public Health revealed that common soaps are as effective as the antibacterial soaps for the consumer containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate hand bacteria.
The pleasant hot water to wash your hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
The bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, jabonous tibia is more effective than cold jabonous water to eliminate natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using tap water has no effect on reducing microbial load in the hands.
A hand disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a waterless agent for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the twenty-first century, waterless and alcohol-free hand hygiene agents (also known as hand-based hand-to-hand solution for hand-to-hand navigation, antiseptic hand-to-hand solution or hand-to-hand disinfectants) began to acquire popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol drying.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing between 60 and 95 % alcohol at least effectively eliminate germs.
Alcohol-based rotary disinfectants eliminate bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (SARM and ELV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based rotary disinfectants containing 70 % of alcohol eliminate 99.97 % (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99 % to 99.999 % (reduction of 4-5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectants are practically ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Enough antiseptic hands solution or alcohol-based solution should be used to float, such as to moisturize or completely cover both hands.
The palm and the back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are sprayed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is followed.
The fingertips should also be washed properly, spraying them in both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend hand washing before hand disinfectants to spray, especially when hands are visiblely dirty.
The increase in the use of these agents is based on their ease of use and on the rapid disposal of micro-organisms; however, they should not be used as replacement for adequate hand washing unless water or soap is available.
The frequent use of the disinfectants for alcohol-based hands can dry the skin, unless embolisers or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol drying may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based disinfectants containing emulsifiers caused a significantly lower irritation and dryness of the skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic dermatitis by contact, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in solutions for alcohol-based hand to rot are very rare.
The slightest tendency to provoke irritant dermatitis by contact was attractive compared to hand washing with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove the organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends largely on the ingredients and formula, in addition, historically, has been much lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions to float.
More recently, it has been proven that the formulas that use benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and use ash or land instead.
Ascensions or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of diseases rather than decrease them.
Like soap, ashes are also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, they form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent transmission of diseases includes the following steps:
Swallow your hands with hot or cold water.
Current water is recommended because the container with blocked water may be contaminated, while the water temperature appears to make no difference.
Swallow your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people usually wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Retrieval for at least 20 seconds.
Restricting creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and restricts during longer periods removes more germs.
Play well with running water.
Playing in a container can contaminate your hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let the air dry.
Wet and wet hands are again contaminated more easily. The parts that are more often forgotten are thumb, doll, areas between fingers and under the nails
The artificial nails and the enamel of unscathed nails can accommodate micro-organisms.
Humidant lotion is often recommended to prevent hands from being dried; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate hand washing when there is no running water or soap available, for example, to pour water from a well or a well with appropriate victims or to use ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is a limited supply of water (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "housewives" and other economic options.
A home grip is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jar of a soda and a leg-operated lever to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a bar soap.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a certain debate about the most effective drying in public bathrooms.
More and more research indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Paper Towels Association, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air towel dryers and more modern air towel dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was detected that the total number of bacteria increased on average 194 % in fingers and 254 % in palms.
Drying with the air soaker resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria of 42 % in fingers and 15 % in palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on average decreased by 76% in fingers and 77% in palms. Scientists also performed tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The airflow dryer, which breathes air from the unit at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow the micro-organisms of the hands and the unit and, potentially, to contaminate other users of the bathroom and the bathroom at a distance of up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot air dryer spread the micro-organisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of micro-organisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the bacterial count after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing hands with hands disinfectant is an alternative during travel, when there is no water or soap.
The disinfectant for alcohol-based hands must contain at least 60 % alcohol.
The washing of doctors became compulsory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide comments to remind hospital staff who wash their hands when they forget.
One study examined a decrease in the rate of infection with its use.
The washing of the doctors’ hands is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and restrict all parts of the hands.
Hands must be limited together by intertwining their fingers.
If there are residues under the nails, a pig brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to wash them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents hands from being contaminated again by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogen microorganisms ("germen") and to avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of hand washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
A study showed that correct hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a paper showing hand washing and standard hand drilling in the medical care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization's hand hygiene guide can also be found on its website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices may measure and verify the hygiene of the hand if the demonstration of compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
the addition of antiseptic chemicals into the soap (medical or antibacterial soaps) gives the possibility of eliminating the hand washing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments in which antibiotics-resistant organisms are very common. To wash hands before surgery, it is necessary to have a grip that can be opened and closed without touching hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry hands after washing, a sterilized brush to fry and another sterilized tool to clean under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and forearms up to the elbow, in general, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When ingested, water must be avoided from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands dry with a sterilized cloth and a surgical bat is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after treating sick people.
In order to control the infections caused by staphylococcus in hospitals, it has been proven that the highest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of the wash and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the rate of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
The common soap wash results in more than triple incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to the antibacterial soap wash. By comparing hand washing with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that alcohol-frotate reduced the contamination of bacteria by 26% more than the antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective in reducing influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium spores difficult of the hands than alcohol-based hand disinfectants. The interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centres may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of hand disinfectant for alcohol-based hands and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are the most effective in the different health care environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an economic and fundamental tool to achieve good health and even good food.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or facilities to wash hands in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing procedures.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few grips to wash hands near public or private portraits, although there are economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be the result of rooted habits rather than of lack of soap or water.
The promotion of hand washing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and bring about a change in behaviour in the long-term population.
In order for this to work effectively, it is necessary to follow up and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective to increase hand washing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Stars" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students wash hands with soap, including hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can finally pass from one to three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand-washing campaigns that are being carried out to reduce childhood diseases and mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness campaign that seeks to achieve a change in behavior. As a result of the pandemic of coronavirus 2019-2020, UNICEF encouraged the creation of a hand washing emoticon.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting hands washing with soap is significantly more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers to hospitals, was first recognized in the middle of the 20th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-related infections led the United States Disease Control and Prevention Centres to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of porcine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have made many countries more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters were hung with "right hand washing techniques" along with the bathrooms of public bathrooms and the bathrooms of office and airport buildings.
The phrase "to wash your hands" is a statement that you do not want to take charge of something or share the complexity of something.
It has its origin in the Bible passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but has become a much wider use phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which represents her conscience of guilt over the crimes she had committed and that she had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been proven that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to appreciate the elements for washing their hands.
Moreover, those who have allowed themselves to be washed after such reflection have less chance of being involved in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend washing hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, with water, but without soap, is part of the washing of ritual hands in many religions, such as Bahaism, Hinduism, Tevila and Nethilate Yadayim in Judaism, the washing of Christianity and the Wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend washing of hygienic hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force hands to wash after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sisanism, Judaism and Islam force hands to wash before and after each meal.
Risk controls at the workplace to the COVID-19
Risk controls at the workplace to COVID-19 relate to the application of hygiene and occupational safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and work and are based on a risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be willing to contract COVID-19.
According to the United States Security and Occupational Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work has minimal working contact with the public and workmates, for which basic infections prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, the recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Average exposure risk work includes those where frequent or close contact is required with persons who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19 but who could be infected by the current Community transit or by an international journey.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a lot of concentration of people and some large retail sales environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective coverings and individual protection equipment available if there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that workers in health care and funeral services, exposed to persons who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases significantly if they perform procedures that may generate aerosols in persons who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these persons.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, and individual protection equipment suitable for work activity.
The outbreaks of COVID-19 may have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may miss work because they are sick, because they have to care for others, or because of fear of exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are claimed and in terms of means of acquiring those goods (such as buying in hours that are not peaked, by sending to home or by window from the car).
Finally, shipments of articles from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted; a plan for preparation and response to infectious diseases could be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including exposure sources, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and risk factors for individual workers, such as age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls necessary to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to a outbreak include reducing the transmission among staff members, protecting those at greater risk of suffering adverse health complications, maintaining trade operations and minimising the adverse effects on other entities of their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk control is a widely used framework for hygiene and occupational safety to classify risk control according to its effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative and, ultimately, individual protection teams.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to the behaviour of workers and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures that require action by the worker or the employer.
Individual protection teams are considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but may help prevent some exposures.
All types of individual protection equipment must be selected according to the hazard to the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g. the breathers), used properly and systematically, reviewed frequently, maintained, replaced, cleaned and disposed of properly, and disposed of in order not to be contaminated.
According to the U.S. Health and Occupational Safety Administration (OSHA), work at a lower risk of exposure has minimal work with the public and workmates.
The prevention measures for basic infections recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, the recommendation for workers to stay at home if they are sick, the standards of respiratory hygiene that include covering themselves when coughing and sneezing, the provision of paper panels and containers for waste, the preparation for teleworking or shifting if necessary, the deterrence of workers from using foreign tools and equipment and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of persons who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others at work.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms stay in their homes until they stop having fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms during at least 24 hours without taking medicines to relieve symptoms or reduce fever; that sickness licensing policies be flexible and allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, medium exposure risk work includes those who require frequent or close to six feet (1.8 m) contact with persons who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but who could have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of the Community transmission of the time around the company's location, or because the person made a recent international journey to a place with generalized transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a lot of concentration of people and some retail environments of large size. Engineering controls for this group and the higher risk groups include installation of high-efficiency air filters, setting up increased ventilation rates, setting up physical barriers to places that are not essential to the existing plastic spills of COVID-19, developing a service window for the client to ask for the car. Administrative controls for this group and the higher risk groups include recommending sick workers who are staying at home, replacing existing meetings with high-efficiency communications, setting up extended tours, suspending visits that are not essential to sites with existing releases of COVID-19, developing the client's client's client's instructions, developing communications that are available to the client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's client's account.
Workers in this risk group rarely have to use breathing aids.
If a person is sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the other person at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to take care of the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper panel when he or she is coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should use disposable surgical gloves to care for a sick passenger or to play body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and perhaps individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruises and other ships carrying passengers, risk controls include delaying the journey by disease, self-infliction and immediately informing the medical centre on board if someone has fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the case of schools and childcare centres, CDCs recommend short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of the community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical or corporal education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between the dolls, scaling up the arrival and departure schedules, limiting visits that are not essential and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, it can be considered to extend the cancellation of classes. For police personnel carrying out daily routine activities, CDCs consider that the immediate risk to health is low.
It is recommended that police officers who should contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19 follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers must clean and disinfect their work belt and their equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning towels before re-use them and follow the standard operating procedure for the storage and disposal of personal protective equipment and the storage and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgue workers are in high or very high risk of exposure.
Among the high-risk exposure work are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.
These become very high exposure risk work if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling.
High-risk morgue work includes those in which workers are involved in the preparation of the corpses of persons with COVID-19 or suspected to have it at the time of death; these become a very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsys. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19, even when they are performed with aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some medical and morgue settings.
Samples should be manipulated by taking precautions at Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter different waiting rooms be separated depending on whether or not they can have COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those who work up to 6 feet away from patients who have been infected or suspected of having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who carry out aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 must be used with filter mask approved by NIOSH or higher in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes proof of adjustment, training and medical examination.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve the worker’s comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one transmitted by body fluids.
The WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples of patients with COVID-19, give them attention or transport them without conducting aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses or facial protective, bat and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is carried out, the surgical mask should be replaced by a breather N95 or FFP2.
Because the provision of personal protection equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimising the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the admission permit to a patient's room with COVID-19 only to those involved in their direct attention, using the same mask without withdrawing it while giving attention to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection equipment and encouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic persons.

Subject: [Covid-19] To ease the burden and prepare for the future
Date/Time of dispatch: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, coordinated universal time
LICENCE: CC0: No reserved rights
This month, we meet in unique circumstances.
The epidemic of COVID-19 highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges we face have no precedents, but we know that our best response is rooted in the empathy, cooperation and overall Community construction that are at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues in e-mail messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible the people with whom we are lucky to work are.
I could not feel more grateful and proud that all of you are my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
His work makes this possible, whether by maintaining the sites in operation, helping our partners to receive their payment or to keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides today more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do but how we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, starting next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and our schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to talk about our approach and our schedule for the next days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we thought would be an adequate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be very useful for the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place at present, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, shopping or going to the doctor, our priority is their well-being.
We're not taking account of your hours.
If he's sick, he doesn't work.
Although you shouldn't have to say it, we say it.
It is not necessary to apply for sick leave or paid free time; only inform your manager and assist your team to review the schedules and schedules to ensure that the key areas of the work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, notify Bryan of T&C Operations so that T&C can help with support and ensure that the management is at the best of its situation).
The people who work an hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and staff members working per hour.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly gratifying, especially in these times.
Again, it is about your personal care.
What we ask them to communicate with their manager is that we know what to expect and can adapt properly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we have to keep doing.
The site Trust Engineering, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fund Recovery teams, among other things, are carrying out a critical work that could require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and modify our approach in order to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing speed today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We don't plan to "double the hours to get us up" when the pandemic is over.
I will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and we will work to set new goals and deadlines when appropriate.
What happens to APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of working hours daily, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our Annual Planning 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that gives more time to the budget so that employees can prioritise the critical work, personal care and care of loved ones as we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of our timetable greatly reduces the current planning and pressure load across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will inform delegates and teams of the next steps we have only one confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Status, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week we realized that one of our partners in the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hire an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and lifts that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our associates in New York City already know, we also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing, but they may be delayed.
Some of our partners work remotely for the first time.
Our partners who have worked remotely since then know that this mode requires adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
Limits the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them during the course of several days.
It clearly defines the meeting with a list of themes and sends reading materials with anticipation.
Adopt video usage by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Design a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls the questions in the chat and list of speakers, and someone who helps to take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable earphones.
Use the refrigerated welfare refund.
Join the channel #remotes in Slack to talk to your partners about distributed work
The RR. HH. Operations team is analysing the guidelines on ergonomics based on web seminars to support increased work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This last week we are asking all beneficiaries of Community subsidies to cancel the public events financed by Wikimedia, such as the editions, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for having to delay or modify those objectives.
This week we will follow up with additional guidelines in Wikimania and other Community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at the global level seems to be partly sadness over the interruption and partly relief from the clarity and ability to focus on its own communities, both that of Wikimedia and others.
Next, CRT will be working to establish a page in Meta-Wiki in order to give the community a space to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keep in touch with the issues of COVID-19
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 h, coordinated universal time 07:00 h, Pacific time, for a special meeting of staff.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We are together in this and we are available to help in the way we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information about this email message and all additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries currently severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, coverage problem or anything you might need help with, don't hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If you have confidential or sensitive issues, send an email to Bryan Juden, Director of International Global Operations of RR. HH.
None of these changes should be considered as abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, I am aware that, at this point, our work and our obligations must probably be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe necessary to support each other so that we can continue working, give our movement the necessary support and give the world the service it trusts.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need you all so that this is possible and, therefore, we need you to take care of yourself and your families so that you can find yourself in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leaderage team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The convertible enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme that adheres to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, the heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) related by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic dial for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as an entry point for some crown viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme that contains zinc and is located on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a C-terminal domain of collectrin amino acids.
ECA2 is a single-type I membrane protein with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is removed from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as shedasa and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and, ultimately, is excreted through the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is mainly attached to the cell membrane of Type II alveolar cells of the lungs, to the enterocytes of the thin intestine, to the arterial and endothelial venous cells and to the arterial cells of the smooth muscle of most organs.
The expression of ECA2's MARN is also found in the brain cortex, the stranded body, the hypothalamus and the brain trunk.
The main function of the ECA2 is to counter the ECA.
The ECA lowers the hormone of angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
ECA2, in turn, reduces the amino acid carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis to form angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 may also remove several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinine, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and grelin.
ECA2 also regulates the movement of membranes of the transporter of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup’s disease.
As transmembrane protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronary viruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus).
More specifically, the union of the S1 protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the surface of the cells results in endocytosis and the transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to endosomals within the cells.
This input process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the guest's TMPRSS2 protein serum, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain assumptions that reducing ECA2 levels in cells could help fight infection.
However , various professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing ECA and standard BRA inhibitor therapy .
A systematic meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ECA inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not so solid for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury and seems to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in lactons with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharides.
The mean life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour effect (duration).
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to the classical renin-angiotensin inhibitors (SRA inhibitors) or in diseases in which angiotensin II is found to be high. rhECA2 infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronary pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") that might have been in contact with a infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with the official support of the Government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Concerns have been raised about privacy, in particular regarding systems based on the geographical location of the users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly on their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is already in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore it is using an application called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by a local IT community, it was launched as an open-source application and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia it was launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to the health authorities.
The implementation was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that the tracking of contacts was at an advanced stage of development and that it would be available for implementation in the coming weeks.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the Singapore BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetry application for patients living in Moscow and have received a diagnosis of COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of Safety Engineering at Cambridge University, exposed several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and possible lack of effectiveness if implementation is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of fraudulent or harmful “coronavirus” applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications in its App Store to “official” or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through the applications of the crown virus and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the pandemic of the crown virus will be dismantled once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations submitted a communication demanding limits to this kind of monitoring.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and monitoring would have to have extermination clauses;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
Digital monitoring should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
Protection against abuse should be implemented and citizens' rights to respond to such abuse should be established;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be mandatory. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Without Borders, RSF) of Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by withdrawing the tracking mechanism from your operating systems when you no longer need it.
In some countries, a network-based location was used, instead of applications, which removed both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to gross data from locations present potential problems of significant privacy.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems that use central servers only for intercom purposes have been established (see the following section).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an application was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn about possible contacts, the government has also made information on the location available to the public, something that is allowed due to large-scale changes to information privacy laws after the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been published.
The tracking of contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a large number of published investigations that are at least to 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on respectful privacy solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that includes both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, previously known as contact event numbers, CEN) and mobile contact tracking mechanisms for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never come out of the device and all matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location or intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Applications Out of Control: How to Maintain Personal Privacy during an Epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the Enigma MPC SafeTrace platform, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally based on the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of such data.
On 5 April 2020, a number of groups joined around what was essentially the same approach and with highly consistent protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with a view to reducing fragmentation and allowing the global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect for broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms announced an initiative to track contacts that they assured would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, it is intended to implement the system in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official crown virus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address persistent adoption and monitoring problems by distributing the system through operating system updates and then removing them from the same way as the threat has passed.
b'Reperilation (also known as repositionation or therapeutic change) is the re-adjustment of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with the scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfusion of plasma of convalescent. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites.
Analysis of these sites of union provides a reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against the proteins of COVID-19.
Among the most important daily proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papaine-like protease, RNA polymerase directed by ARN, helicase, S protein and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that were then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an anti-paludic medicine that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that New York State trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by an urgent authorisation (USA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised according to an U.S. only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
CDCs said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
In the University of Duke and the University of Oxford, large studies are under way.
The NYU Langone Medical Faculty is conducting a safety and efficacy study on the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen demonstrated that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen showed negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half was administered omifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is low and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug in Japan for its reservations and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug can be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that joins SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, there have been criticisms about the allocation of resources to drug rehabilitation specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international solidarity test.
Reddesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that reddesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple philovirus, nuemovirus, paramix and coronavirus.
An antiviral treatment problem is the development of resistance through mutations that may result in a more severe disease and transmission.
Some initial studies prior to the trials suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by hospitals at the University of Cleveland; one for people with moderate disease and the other for those with a more severe disease.
Three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials are under way for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin antibiotics on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Teijin Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhalable short steroid for asthma, as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new crown virus.
An angiotensin 2 converting enzyme form, a Phase II trial is under way and 200 patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine to reduce inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolled in 6,000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant, who are breast-feeding or who do not have an affective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Heparin of low molecular weight is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on their use.
On 14 April, a multicentre study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin at preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying close attention to the rehabilitation of antiviral drugs that have developed for earlier outbreaks of the SROM, SRAG and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in line with the seventh edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in line with the seventh edition of Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that have been identified for possible re-adjustments for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (block IL-6 receptor): approved by China.

b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop this vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was not expected that there would be a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
An important outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investments and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the genomes published to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were being investigated and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the major platforms leading to Phase I safety studies are the following:
nucleic acid (ADN and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to ESCI scientists in April, a total of 115 possible vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 others are announced, but with little information available (it is assumed to be planning or developing).
A Phase I or II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, is controlled by placebo and is performed in several locations, while determining more precise and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease while controlling the adverse effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccines (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (continued in preclinical research).
About 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a vaccine with molecular subjection that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
About 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human tests to begin in 2021.
Vaccine Development Projects were announced at the Center for Control and Disease Prevention of China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is codifying an oral vaccine with his biotech partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing association with Vaxart for vaccine development.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine similar to that used in the treatment of neo-antigenous cancer vaccines.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and that the tests were beginning.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Genex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that he was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in the west of Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
About 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a phase I clinical trial and trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, although it was moving fast, it would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a particle similar to the crown virus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is in the laboratory research phase and human tests are expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "a large amount of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against COVID-19", against which the German Government complained.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced an association with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an ARNm-based vaccine.
The potential BNT162-based vaccine is currently under preclinical testing and it is expected that clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that human tests of the possible final vaccine could begin in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Innovation Coalition in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a research alliance of a vaccine against COVID-19, which includes the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which leads to the total investment of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other CEPI partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Modern, Curevac, Inovo, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing animals for six possible vaccines.
The researchers at the Imperial College of London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-replication RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine developed within 14 days of receiving the China sequence.
At the end of March, the Government of Canada announced a funding of CAD 275 million for 96 medical research projects to counter COVID-19, including a large number of possible vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national bank of vaccines" with several new vaccines that could be used if another outbreak of coronavirus occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School announced PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in mice and said that "Vaccines of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 administered by MNA received powerful responses from specific antigens (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal sprayer.
Using bacterial agents, DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacteria and produce virus-like harmless particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. Government, industry and three universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with computing resources in the cloud of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have no specific effects.
This means that they can benefit beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
The vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other non-human laboratory animals and primitives, show the need to include level 3 biosecurity measures for the handling of live viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SRAG that has proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAG was a priority for Governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When the SROM was generalized, it was believed that the existing research on SRAG could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against mers-CoV infection.
In March 2020, a SROM vaccine (based on DNA) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, the other three were in progress, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenovir vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications in the social media promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus caused by COVID-19 was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SRAG coronavirus.
b'Cronavirus 2019 disease (CVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms are fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of breath and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary between two and fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organism insufficiency.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been recovered. The virus is spread mainly among people during close contact, usually through gouts that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these drops occur at exhalation, they usually fall on the floor or on the surfaces, instead of being contagious at long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread is also possible before the symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is the reaction in the polymerase chain with inverse real-time transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hyopate.
The use of masks is recommended for those suspected of having the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend not to use them, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those infected by the virus may be asymptomatic or have symptoms similar to those of the flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and face or blue lips. If these symptoms are present, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as dizziness, nasal discharge and throat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been identified as variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented chest depression and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multi-organism insufficiency, and death.
This is called incubation.
The period of incubation of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people with symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. According to reports, not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, the preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to spreading the disease.
The proportion of people with no symptoms is unknown for the time being and is being studied. The Centers for Control and Prevention of Korean Diseases (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of confirmed cases remained symptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both spout and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking aloud frees more drops than when speaking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth on the tosser can cause the gouts to travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually air-transmission, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission through biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the corridor outside people's bedrooms gave positive results in viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary animation (RCP) may lead to aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility that the disease is spreading, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread is possible before the onset of the symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not quite clear the ease with which it spreads, a person is generally infected with two or three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surface.
In particular, the virus was detected during one day in the cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99 % copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergent are also effective if used properly. The soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, besides removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saline samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second test day.
The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the associated natural coronation viruses.
Outside of the human body, the domestic soap kills the virus, as it returns its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs of COVID-19, due to the virus entering host cells through the type 2 angiotensin I (ECA2) convertible enzyme, which is more abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicula" (peplomer) to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, a acute heart injury was identified, which is more frequent in serious illness.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute myocardial injury may be related to ECA2 receptors in the heart.
The ECA2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in its operation.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in patients with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a prognosis. In the autopsys of people who died from COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes in the lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropics for epithelial cells expressing ECA2 from respiratory pathways, patients with COVID-19 have severe symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that GM-CSF secretaries T were associated with the recruitment of IL-6 secretaries and a severe pulmonary disease in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsys, lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with inverse real-time transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in samples of respiratory pathways obtained by a nasopharyngeal hisopate; however, samples of nasal or sputum hisopate can also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood analysis can also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two weeks of difference and the results have very little immediate value.
The Chinese scientists managed to isolate the strain of the coronary virus and published the genetic sequence so that the world's laboratories could independently develop polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect the virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were being developed but were not widely used.
Experience in China with evidence has shown that accuracy is only between 60% and 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnosis test on 21 March 2020 to use it for the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University would suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobular embossed glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common at the initial stages of the infection.
As the disease progresses, there may be subpleural domain, disordered empedade pattern (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and physiopathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsys are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia may be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, neutrocyte hyperplasia, atypically large neutrocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxaemia.
treatment pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: dilute intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with water and soap frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The CDCs recommend covering the mouth and nose with a towel when coughing or shaking and, in the absence of panels, use the inner part of the code.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
CDCs have recommended the use of screen covers in public places, one of the reasons is to limit the transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies seek to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and places of work, restricting travel and canceling crowding public meetings.
The distance patterns also indicate that persons must maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As no vaccine is expected until 2021, as very soon, a key part to control COVID-19 is to try to prevent epidemimal peaks, which is known as "planning the curve".
CDCs also recommend washing hands frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are clearly dirty, before eating and after sounding the nose, coughing or shaking.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant that has a minimum of 60% of alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available on time. For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to obtain, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are given supportive attention, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of having the virus use a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory insufficiency, but the benefits are still being analysed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and lifestyle and healthy food have been recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms at the initial stage of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensiveists and neurologists in the U.S. have compiled the recommendations of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend parthetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen.
Caution should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care environments when procedures that may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation, are carried out.
CDCs recommend health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 to place the patient in an air-infection isolation zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. CDCs highlight the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (EPP) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is EPP, mask, protective fronts and medical gloves. When available, the breathers are preferred (instead of masks).
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorised their use by means of an emergency use permit (U.S.).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but do not guarantee effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not specified in the product indications.
When no masks are available, CDCs recommend the use of protective belts or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is actively being studied for people hospitalized with respiratory insufficiency associated with COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a nasal canal of high flow or positive bisection on respiratory pathways.
It is still not known whether any of these two benefit the same person in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high flow nasal canal. Serious cases are mainly performed in older adults (over 60 years and in particular older than 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough bed per head in hospitals, which limits the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in serious cases of COVID-19 that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators that have different pressure control modes and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply while minimising the risk of pulmonary injury associated with the respiratory and neumotorax.
The oldest respirators may not have high PPTE.
The research on possible treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The reddesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may take up to 2021, several medicines that are already being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced tests.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends that volunteers take part in efficacy and safety tests for possible treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation to plasma of convalescent as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been submitted to the necessary clinical studies to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect the "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-confining, but also warns local health officials. Analysis of cell information macrodata, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those who were in contact with South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track data on the mobile phones of persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect those who could come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summary data of the location of the phones with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine failures.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said that mobile telephony operators have informed him that "in any way, 40% of people are still moving".
The German Government carried out a 48-hour weekend hack with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of the crown virus.
People may feel anxious about the quarantine, travel restrictions and side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety about health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's health and well-being."
The disease can follow a slight evolution with little or no symptoms, so other diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as the common cold will appear.
Light cases are usually recovered within two weeks, while serious or critical cases may take from three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of contracting a serious infection by the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SRAG virus and the SROM, but the data from COVID-19 are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In cases of more serious, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to water difficulty syndrome (SDRA) causing respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organism insufficiency.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, changes in coagulation and cardiac, renal and hepatic damage.
The change in coagulation, specifically the increase in protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; while the change in renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with CODIV-19 have high liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, the mean time between hospitalization and death was seven days.
In a study of early cases, the median time from the onset of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a complete range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and among women was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with exuded cell fibromyxides in both lungs.
Viral cytopathetic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs was similar to the acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage resulted from high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to the March data in the United States, 89% of hospitalized persons had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic aspects of a region could also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates for the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The insufficient count of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that death is the result of cases in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or to die compared to non-smokers. Long-term sequelae of this disease are concerned.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20-30 per cent reduction in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and the images of the lungs suggest organ damage.
This can also cause the syndrome after intensive care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity appears to be possible, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of recovered COVID-19 have been reported that were subsequently positive for coronavirus.
These cases are believed to be an exacerbation of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered natural and of animal origin by means of an interspecific infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to the transmission between humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of onset of symptoms as of 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on 8 December 2019.
A number of measures are generally taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary regionally and over time, in addition to being affected by the volume of evidence, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time spent from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency CIE-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection laboratory. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a specified time interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the overall mortality rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who die from a disease, and the mortality rate in infected people, which reflects the percentage of people who die from a disease (with or without a diagnosis).
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, their presence may provide information on how many people were infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) had already died.
In Gangelt, his disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the younger ones, so there was relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths by COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exceeded.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3 per cent of the population has antibodies, according to blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004 per cent of the population) died of COVID-19.
The impact of pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only 90 years old.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in males and 1.7 in females.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are not known, but it could be due to genetic and behavioural factors.
Immunological gender-based differences, the lower number of women who smoke and the fact that men have congested diseases, such as hypertension, at an earlier age could have contributed to the higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were males and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were males.
By April 2020, the U.S. Government did not trace information on sex in the virus infections of COVID-19.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAG, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, in particular nursing staff, are women, and have more exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
The head of WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of persons, in accordance with international recommendations is named to prevent stigmatization. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in public communications.
It is common to use coronavirus to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and the disease as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and the disease, according to the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials, such as nasal hyopes and respiratory parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a breather valve and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local emerging company performed reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves during the night.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation about origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that were rapidly spread over the Internet emerged.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study did not find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no medicines or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and sector researchers are conducting international investigations into vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "Solidarity Test" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds in terms of effectiveness.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ECA2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.
First, researchers seek to develop a full virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on protein S that helps the virus to enter the ECA2 receptor.
A third strategy is nuclear acid vaccines (ADN or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains a safe copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
By April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven studies evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Re-adapted antiviral drugs constitute most of the Chinese research, including nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries and are to be submitted by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible drugs against COVID-19 was under way. Several antiviral medicinal products for the treatment of COVID-19 are evaluated, including the following: reddesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
In March 2020, there is evidence of attempt on the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. The chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer review for the investigation.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Virology Institute recommends a daily dose of one gram, it points out that the double dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The seventh edition of Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
More in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended, after finding that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial excretion of the S-protein by type 2 transmembrane serum (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the receptor ECA2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines can be a complication of the last stages of serious COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that avoid the release of cytokines. The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in treatment guidelines after completion of a small study.
It is in a national test not randomized in Phase II in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a blood test of serum ferritin to identify cytokine releases, you have countered these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of cytokine-resistant steroid-induced cytokine release syndrome, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes in 2017.
To date, there is no unsolicited controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 is being investigated to people who need them as a passive method of immunization without vaccines.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with unconcluding results.
Viral neutralisation is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cellular cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies are being developed, for example, using monoclonal antibodies manufactured.
The production of confluent serum, which is the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died of COVID-19 after generating awareness of the spread of the virus.
