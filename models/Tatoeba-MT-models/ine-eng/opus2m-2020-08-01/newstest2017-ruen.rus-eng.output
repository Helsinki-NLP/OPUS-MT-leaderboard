Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years
The International Panel of Biologists concluded that the most expensive pets are Greenland’s polar sharks, which may live for about 500 years, is transmitted by RT.
Scientists have conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the crystalline of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark in its length of more than three feet may be between 272 and 512 years.
Biologists believe that low metabolism plays an important role in the longevity of the shark, leading to slow development.
The female Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity of only 150 years.
It was previously believed that the “neighbourly” shark is a Greenland whale.
The oldest person known as the scientist was 210 years old.

Is it worth going to a sanatorium if there's no health problem?
Our expert is the chief health doctor, Olga Bogush.
And if a healthy person just gets tired of his work, does he have to go to a sanatorium?
We need health care not only to treat, but also to prevent diseases.
Under sanitary conditions, a person can check the condition of his or her body and receive advice from a doctor as to how to live so that his or her health is not ruined.
Such recommendations will not be too much for anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal to the body, and it doesn't have to be removed.
Persistent stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is about 90% of the visitors.
The most important thing is that he is subject to people from large cities from 45 to 55 years of age.
So it's better not to make the situation more difficult and give yourself time to rest.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people have reduced their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to leave with your children, you won't have to break up with them.
For children, even the youngest, health programmes include both diagnostic services, paediatric consultations, analyses and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, acidic cocktails, medical physics.
The course of procedures shall be determined by a doctor taking into account the individual evidence and characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, a children's club with animators is usually used in sanatoriums, where children can attend games, different master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with young people, provide the necessary conditions for the breasts and provide experienced nurse services.
The mild winter, long summer, the sunny days of the year (over 300) create good conditions for a round-year vacation in the Caucasian Mineral Water resorts.
And then the organism needs to rest not only in summer.
So there is no need to fear the weather behind the window, as most procedures are in the room and do not depend on the season.
In general, health care is desirable twice a year, especially for adults.
The main fish of the Caucasian Mineral Water region is, of course, the treatment of mineral sources: Slavyanovski, Smyrnovski, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects different systems of the body.
Water varies by temperature, amount of salt, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks water depending on the patient’s feelings.
Thus, Narzan has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating effects, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and the exchange of substances.
"Essentuki-4" affects the stomach tract, reduces sugar levels.
“New sensations” have anti-inflammatory, greedy and wet effects.
The same effects also have the Slavian water.
When appointing water, the doctor must take into account the condition of the heart system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks less salt water because the salts hold the fluid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
The intake of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be consumed at a certain time, in the required quantity and specific temperature.
Different cosmetic procedures for individuals and bodies are now available in the sanatorium.
What forms of healing based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus can be obtained in the resorts of the region?
Close to Petitogorsk, for example, there is a salty lake of Tambukan, adding a sin that is useful for the components, the bellows, the internal organs.
It provides anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immunomodulating action.
These are healthy walks on individual routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort (second in size in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is close to the mineral source Narzan.
There you can also take the baths of wine, vegetables, iodine, lignite, sulfane-lacric, depending on what your doctor will appoint you.
We're renewing fertility.
What can you do to make the harvest go to the end of the season?
As told by Julia Belopuhova, an agronomist and a tax collector.
It is time for the high - volume atoms to set up a cutting: to remove new beads, to cut the beads, to remove all leaves until the last box with fruit and flowers with small bonds - can not be harvested.
All tomatoes, regardless of “constitution”, as well as pears and bacteriums, are fed by a copper-superphosphate extract, processed by bio-preparations (Assistant for the acceleration of influx and growth of fruits, Phitosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamair, Bactophyt - of diseases, Immunocyte - for the improvement of immunity, Bitoxybacillus, Lepidocide, Fitoverm - if there are harmful).
From chemicals at the end of the summer, only honey cocoons, colloide cheese and green flour should be used.
We're doing the last crop.
The long-lasting heat bubbles are lowered from the spalers so that the lower, covered part of the tree (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, drained by warm water and Circone solution, and 5-7 cm of compost.
It is also easy to extend the fertilization of the cavities: cut old leaves, pour hot water and a solution of complex welling, put the fertile soil under the bush.
In order to protect from night colds, lay above a chain of length with concealment material.
Keep the plant open on the day of the plant, and close the sun after sunset.
The signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia ' s exit for the last 20 years.
As noted by Bloomberg's analysis agency, GDP RF shows a positive trend - in the second quarter, GDP fell by 0.8 per cent per annum.
This indicator has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to Russia's latest data, the Russian economy dropped to 0.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The stabilization of the situation was also recently stated by the Central Bank and the Mineconomy Development.
Go ahead, slow growth.
In the opinion of the CBD experts, the recession in the Russian economy remained in the past.
"The index assessment of Russian GDP says that the recession remains behind and forward is slow economic growth," says the Bank of Russia 'what trends are talking about.
The monthly GDP estimate for the current quarter of the regulator ' s specialists increased to 0.4 per cent, and the fourth quarter was 0.5 per cent.
As the representative of Mineconomy reported, during the second quarter, the fall in GDP fell in the second quarter, accounting for 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared fall of GDP was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
But the fall occurred during the quarter: in April it was 0.2 per cent, and in May and June the change in GDP was within 0-0.15", - quoted the representative of MER RIA "Newsto".
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the last five quarters shows that it is “underway”.
Among other markers indicating the revitalization of the national economy, Bloomberg calls for increased demand for electricity and rail transport, business revitalization.
If an amendment to the year is high, it is understood that the dynamics of plus 1 per cent of electricity consumption can be partly due to an additional working day.
Let's add a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is an increase in freight transport, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data here, and a further 0.5 per cent of the half-yearly volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Kirill Jacobenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering the price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, Rosstatt has been working on deflation for the past two weeks.
The prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble course, which, although showing strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has increased by 12 per cent since the beginning of August.
It is also one of the signs of recovery that indicators from the real economy must be followed," said Jacobenko.
In addition, there has been an increase in industrial production since April.
In June, the figure rose by 1.7 per cent.
The rate of decline in external trade from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May is slowed.
A positive trend is also demonstrated in the labour market, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.4%.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the issue of the real income available to the population should be left to wish for the best.
The annual figure is reduced by 4.8 per cent.
This factor could slow the recovery of the economy, as household costs contributed little to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the economy exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the strong policy of the Bank of Russia can also be called risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator maintains a rate of 10.5 per cent, which is not best affected by the real sector.
A negative factor is and is not sufficiently high in investment, which hampers industrial capacity development.
Overall, however, it can be expected that by the end of the year, the fall rate of the RF economy will be slowed to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015," said GK Forex Club Irina Rogova, analyst.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and experienced in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, until they develop so actively in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and ex-foreigners are involved, in most cases the natives of the former Soviet Union.
Therefore, in Rio de Janeiro, we can see the reverse process - a sufficient number of Russians are under the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of citizenship varies.
Some parents have moved to another country as a child without leaving the choice.
Someone didn't compete for a place in the Russian assembly.
And someone felt that the best conditions for sports development would be set up abroad.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian nationality.
A 27-year-old girl's German passport says her name is Liza Rizich.
But before she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omska.
Only four years after the Soviet Union broke down, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow her older sister’s steps — to take easy sports.
Like her sister, Lisa picked up six beds.
Stay in Russia if you can't move Elena Isinbaev from the throne.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio Lisa will be our only lander, even though the former, in the six-bedroom sector.
Its best achievements in this form are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaev.
Elena Pirozkova was born in Novokuznecz in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelists.
Much because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight more children were raised in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena started to fight at school.
With good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where another former Russian Vladislav Izbojnik continued to attend the U.S. Training Centre.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost her first shot.
That's why the world's champions won the same year.
Before that, she was able to win the silver in the 2010 World Cup.
Then there were bronzes in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Mary was born in Yaroslavle, where she first met a synchronized swim.
But it says that she was raised by our coaches in Russia, it would be wrong.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
That's where Maria went on her own.
She was soon in the United States and was showing great results in the Pan-American Games.
It is understandable that at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America its indicators are ceilings.
The new name, which sounds more Russian, was received by Kristina Shaldibina at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue training a girl in the arts gymnastics after the ocean.
So far, the girl has been engaged in a popular sport in the Yaroslavle family.
When she immigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the youth assembly in that country and later joined the main national team.
At the American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first place on the world stage, she certainly did not have to fight, but for the United States, she organized this breakthrough, which led to a star-college rally at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Another one of our former "stupid" is Jan Berezko-Marggrander, who is behind the German assembly.
She was born in Tolita.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more opportunities to join the National Assembly.
She was soon representing her country at the 2012 Olympics in London.
There, of course, she was able to take only 17 seats that were not enough for her to fall into the final competitions in private.
So two years earlier, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Youth Games.
Another gymnast, only this time sportsman, Irina Sasonova.
If the ways of emigrating the above mentioned sports are to be called standard, the Irish family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is an educator of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she became the country's champion.
True, Ira is still trained in Russia, especially in order not to lose her skills.
She's not as successful as she'd like to be in Rio.
Better place is 40 in the private pool.
There is very little information about the Navy of Maria Ugulkov in the Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria has been living and training in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it had been under the Russian flag, showing good results - even the country's record was 200 metres away butterfly.
In 2015 she became a Swiss national and became a member of the Red and White flag.
In Rio, its best speech is 14 places in the 4x100 complex.
To get into the game, the girl launched a stealthfanding project that enabled her to collect about 6,000 francs that allowed her to pay for her training at the Olympics.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter, Adam Batirov, spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
At that time, Hasawurta's native was able to become a three-time champion of Europe, a Russian champion, and an international sports master.
When he stopped falling into our national assembly, it was time to think about the change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter has disappeared from sports.
Triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asia Championship - Batirov has already represented Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and received a trip to the Olympics in Rio.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhaila Kudinova, knows more about her family than even about the Swiss sailor Maria Ugulkov.
His parents emigrated from the capital to New Zealand when the boy was quite young.
That's where Michael started sports gymnastics.
He has not achieved more success at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40 seats in parallel drills.
But for New Zealand, even the Olympics in sports gymnastics are already breaking up.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her activities with a synchronized navigation, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, a girl took the sixth place in a synchronized swim at the European Championship in Berlin.
In a duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum Anastasia took eighth place.
In the solo program she was the fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Croyer is in charge of collecting Israel.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, Dmitry had already become a national champion in 17 years.
That same year he won the youth world championship.
The year later, Croyer won the Golden Youth Olympics in Singapore.
In addition to high heels, Dmitry is working long and triple.
31-year-old Albert is another Hasawurt native who, after long speeches to Russia, decided to change his sports nationality.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert has chosen Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia he attended the School of the High Sports Masters of Krasnoyarsk, even becoming the country's champion in 2011.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow as a member of the USSR volleyball team of Yaroslav Antonov.
Almost a year before Yaroslav’s son was born, he was recognized by the best volleyballist on the planet.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained there for a long time.
In 2015, he became the bronze champion of Europe in the national team, which was held in the territory of his new family.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and joined his family in the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
Norway was a real goal, but this northern country had failed - it had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn to fight freely.
He soon won the World Cup among the Juniors, and later qualified to participate in the Olympics.
In Rio he will be the only representative of France in the fight tournament.
And a free fight again, and a former Russian again.
This time it will be about the native of Northern Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain, about Timorese Freeway.
He was granted Spanish citizenship at the end of December 2012, and is currently in charge of the country ' s assembly team.
Before that, the 30-year-old sportsman had been able to score a high score in Russia.
He became the bronze champions of the country in 2007 and 2008.
The Charter of Infallibles in the Assembly decided to change sports nationality.
The last one on our list is a Czech boxer born in 1995 in Dagestan Mahachala, Artur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took his family to Canada through Azerbaijan.
There Arthur, at the advice of his older brother, started boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been a three - time champion of Canada, and in 2012 he has become a world champion among young people.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the gold of Pan American games, the first for his new family since 1975.

Wife, she has a son.
Why do kids talk at school?
According to Governor V. Kondratiev, “it is said to be brought up, not by action and advice, but by system. ”
They must grow and at least 7 years of age realize that they must be storytellers and educators.
But as long as this work seems to me to be done formally and I suspect more on paper.
If the class talkers get all the positive things they've collected before, at a qualitatively new level, I'll be happy.
If I'm all drunk and we don't know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
The GCC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country ' s economy.
There is an impactor on the funds allocated to the community from budgets at different levels.
According to the Gender Procurator ' s Office, overrated tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the field of GCC.
As a result, the region ' s consumers have over 170 million rubles of energy.
In the days and time of the Prosecutor ' s Office of the Krasnodar Region, the fact that the charges were included was unfounded.
The costs of IV-consulting (cold water), however, amounted to 4 million rubles for the rental of cars at a higher market price.
And such examples in the country of mass.
The people gave up the latest money for the municipality, which they paid correctly, according to the Ministry of Finance, the average payout from the population was 94 per cent.
It is immediately accused of several articles of the Penal Code: desertion, the legalization of proceeds obtained through crime, abuse of powers, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the city facility repair fund, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, and the work on them was not actually carried out, but was paid.
Businessmen just gave him a lot of money back.
As the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the people, but to the service providers he did not pay and spend it on his own.
As a result, millions of rubles have been damaged in the budget and residents.
Macarov's machining scheme is typical of Russia.
The whole wave of arrests and detentions by the leaders of the U.K., who had spent money on citizens, had been broken down.
In Kamchatka, the trial against A. Kohan continues, by the way, as well as former forest deputy accused of machining 91.7 million rubles.
As a result, in 2012-2013, he established 6 governing companies in Elizovo Kamchatsky and established 3 companies with limited responsibility.
One of them played a leading role for the UK, and the other two played a role in cashing, i.e. receiving money from the population.
However, A. Kahan did not count the funds but spent it on himself, his favorite.
It is quite difficult to judge in the area of the CCC.
Things aren't starting, they're slowing down.
And “helps” in this extremely confusing housing legislation, it considers Svetlana Desversov, the executive director of NP “ZKH Control”.
We don't have a single law to make, as we're thinking, a new one that has to make the previous one work.
There were also few specialists, including judges, on the subject of CCC.
Lawmakers themselves recognize that housing law is given very little attention in marriage.
Refusals in criminal proceedings are also discussed in the Office of the Attorney-General in the course of investigations.
Of the 3.5 thousand crimes in the proceedings in 2015, less than half are sent to the court.
In the remaining investigation, it was prolonged and each fifth was suspended in connection with the instigation of the accused.
There are often gaps in the activities of law enforcement authorities in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the intelligence authorities are not quick to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeits - a total of 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In the current year, their number increased only slightly -99.
What is the falsification of the protocol for the collection of residents?
This means that changes in household management, financial and other issues are about ownership.
And this also means that housing and community services cannot be run by normal companies who want to work honestly, not "to touch" the population.
It's got to be a low-income, small and medium-sized business, too.
First of all, through the eradication of corruption as a whole, Anton Zarkov, a member of the Committee on Property Affairs, is convinced.
And now this work is underway.
It's not just a single action, it's a targeted anti-corruption course.
Of course, not all regions are in such a dire situation.
In particular, there are no scandals in the capital.
Why are there no GCC scandals in Moscow, like in many other regions?
Since the capital Government had exercised its will and ordered, the “Aif” told Anatoly the Electoral Committee, a member of the Committee of the Voice on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean both personnel and legislative amendments and legal education.
The management companies have been closely monitored and all of them have been licensed.
Citizens' complaints are quickly resolved in public space (and the treatment of residents and response measures are placed on the Government of Moscow portal).
Many not only pay monthly receipts but also carefully follow the way the house is written.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and obligations of resource and management organizations is very high.
In addition, Moscow examines the eligibility of housing and community service tariffs, because a large portion of the budget is available for grants and benefits for many categories of population.
It must be all together and explains the peaceful conditions in Moscow.
Is everything supported by the regional authorities?
Maybe it's useless to change the place of work?
Turkish gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, issued the U.S. ultimatum, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup.
He said so in front of his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to renounce the support of the "Terrorist Fethullahists" organization.
This is not Turkey's first statement, in which the United States is called upon to change its position.
Experts believe that the break-up with the West is increasing and may lead to a new attempt to change the country.
"In early or late America will make a choice between Turkey and the FETO ("Terrorist Fethullachist Organization").
Or organizing the conversion of FETO, or democratic Turkey.
She must make this choice," quoted the Anatolian Agency for Erdogan’s Treatment, which was held in Ankara on Wednesday evening.
The President of Turkey once again, but it was already more urgent for the United States to meet his demand for the first time since the rebellion.
It is recalled that on the night of 16 July Turkey ' s high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army tried to overthrow the legitimate authority in the country, as well as attempted the life of the head of the State.
However, after Regzep Erdogan addressed the population, the riot was suppressed and his organizers and participants were arrested.
A total of about 8,000 people were suspected of becoming teachers and scientists, in which there were, in addition to the military.
According to Recep Erdogan, their teacher was Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
Erdogan's supporters also admitted that Americans can be involved in the hospital.
All claims were rejected, refusing to issue Guilen and advising to change the tone.
The last statement made by the representatives of Gosdepa on this issue was made at the time of Erdogan ' s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - it insists on it and also demands other Western partners.
"Ankar will cease to fulfil its obligations under a migration agreement with the Euro Union if Brussels does not call the date of the abolition of visa restrictions on Turkish citizens," Turkey ' s EU Minister for Affairs Omer Chelic said on 9 August.
He said that the amendment of the anti-terrorism law by Ankara, as the EU requires, would endanger Europe's own security.
It is noteworthy that on 1 August, German Deputy Chancellor Zigmar Gabriel demanded Turkey to stop the Euro Union's blackmail with promises of opening the borders for migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were a response to the relevant statement made by the head of the media of Turkey, Mevlut Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement by Chavushoglu made in the past Wednesday, allowing Turkey to leave NATO.
The head of Turkey did not rule out that the country would consider getting out of the alliance unless it met the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the field of defence is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries working with foreign defence countries - they import missiles," Chavushoglu said in an interview with the Anadolu Agency.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system based on its technology and to cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has so far tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun looking for others," said the Minister.
Experts believe that all of this refers to Turkey ' s serious differences with the West and the country ' s reorientation to the East.
The Head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Evgenian Minchenko, believes that Regzep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go to a hard confrontation with the West.
He has a lot of business in the West and from the military point of view (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance it by maintaining a framework of relations with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a fully obedient person in this position," explained the AIF.ru expert.
According to him, it was not excluded that after the Turkish leader ' s statements (not paying for EU compensation, demand for visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulena from the United States) would be put to pressure.
"Rezep Erdogan will face the deterioration of relations with both America and the European Union, and they will press on it on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of country management and so on," says Minchenko.
The Head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, allows the President of Turkey to change his views on Russia as soon as he can.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took a very harsh position against Russia and sought favor in all ways in the West.
For a very short time, the situation had changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities for a while.
I think Erdogan entered the lead period.
When he is between the two Poles - the West and Russia - he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Muhin says.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to retain political power in the country, so that he needs Russia and his partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting the United States of America.
Turkey needs the EU and the United States, which are using it to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Consensus with Turkey will therefore be achieved," he said.
In other words, the head of the Asia Centre and the Middle East is Anna Glaza.
At present, both Turkey and the EU and the United States are sufficiently tense, and this is primarily linked to the internal policy of Erdogan.
I think that this crisis will be intensified in relations, and in the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to recharge both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
Not by accident, the President of Turkey and a number of Turkish politicians say that they are ready to change their position on a number of Syrian issues, that relations with Israel have been resolved, that there is an active political interaction with Iran," explained AIF.ru Glazas, which will allow the next step of Erdogan to normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, Erdogan's policy now is to return to the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in the "no problems with its neighbours".
The President of Turkey's visit to Russia and the country of Africa has now been very successful.
The foreign policy vector will therefore develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's position both on the regional and international stage," the expert said.
The vote believes that it will be extremely difficult for Turkey to return to its former relations with the EU, and now the question is whether the EU will start to respond strictly to Turkey, which can go to the opening of borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Medical strike: Calls for new collective protests
The representatives of the doctors asked the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute about the new employment contract.
The Committee of the Young Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is planning to request its full advice to support more collective protests since the beginning of September.
JDC said the ministers had not been able to answer questions about the employment contract.
The younger doctors and medical students in July voted in favour of the cancellation of the contract agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret vote.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, President JDC Ellen McCort said that the Government continued to "keep silent" about the problems that she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: “In view of the current situation, the leader of JDC voted for the rejection of the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiation on all your issues.”
In response to the Government ' s silence, the leader of JDC today made an official request to the extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme for the expansion of collective protests from early September.
The dispute led to the participation of young doctors in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of BMA, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after voting for the cancellation of the agreed terms of the contract, which was recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was good to be accepted during the meetings in advance of the vote by 54,000 young doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that this contract would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: Bad Alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague to the gold courtroom in St. Petersburg, I found it hard to believe that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was handcuffing, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked tense, and he could hardly remove the heat even according to his own held standards.
Regzep Taipei Erdogan, in contrast, repeatedly spoke about his "other dear" Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their precrisis level but even above.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to be coming back.
But the prolonged cold coming from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the crisis was the first one he mentioned in his introductory comments: Turkey had beaten the Russian excavator at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that time was unbearable.
Mr. Putin was angry with the angry tyrant, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
Grief was even stronger on the basis of an alleged friend.
Retrieval of real trust would be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
Over the months, the media-controlled State conducted a staggering, total attack on Ankara.
It turned out suddenly that the Turks should be held guilty.
The most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Mr. Erdogan ' s own family had engaged in the illegal trade of oil from the Syrian zone controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He totally denied it.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin had received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could have claimed victory of its kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of the proclamation of peace are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost kicked off his post last month while trying to turn.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit heavily — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually take several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The quantity fell sharply by almost 90%.
With regard to Russia, tour operators and charter companies here, of course, feel relief when the flights finally resume.
They're putting a peak at the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," said the report in the newspaper Vedomosta.
But the visit also had added political value to Moscow.
Ankara's evil against the West because she thinks it's a weak response to a coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged dissatisfaction with the slow pace of the EU accession talks and Mr. Putin's move, which seeks to take advantage of the cold and gradually destroy Turkish relations with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the bonus rounds with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after a coup attempt.
Remember, this data is for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of changing the regime.
Thus, the summit in this shining palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine that one analyst described me as a “bad alliance”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated in the West are uniting forces.
Nevertheless, despite a public demonstration of reconciliation, the two remain in significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently been a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
He may be speaking for himself that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents had given a press conference, they had not even touched on the topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of a complete disaster when a member of NATO struck a Russian reactive outlaw, it is certainly better that at least two leaders speak again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland
Brand RBS should be brought into the role of back office, according to the Executive Director of the Bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank withdrew from them almost eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies were used by RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
He was supported by millions of pounds of international sponsorship, from Cuba to Wimbledon Andy Murrey.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national fires to come out first.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scotland's clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external headquarters and the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already being used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the banking of private individuals who will have more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan interviewed customers and staff in Invernessshire during the tour.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brand RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one that will employ our staff, because we are now becoming more brand banks."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its population groups, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship support to Cuba of six nations, and it is increasing the profile of various brands in sport sponsorship.
"This is the right time for us to drive a brand bank, because on the basis (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said that we were going to be a remarkable bank for customers and close all these brands.
But with the work we did, focusing on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can return these brands again, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori comes to 3,000 winners with victory in New Market at Pristrasti
The kids are spraying champagne after the double in New Market brings it to 3,000 wins
Jokai Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th British victory in New Market on Friday.
He came to this outstanding note with his second winner of the night on his home path, at the Pristratia, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who has reached this remarkable mark in smooth jumps.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Long Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Idder and Willie Carson.
A three-time jet champion, Dettori, who had won the Ghaiyar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here, too.
I'm very glad it happened in Newmarket, because it was here that I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big world event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free from business and I'm very intimidating.
Children accept applause when they are satisfied after victory
Two jockeys reached such an obstacle jumps: Richard Johnson's jockey champion and retired 20-time Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4300 for a record career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time winner Derby, 4493 wins in the career
Franky is one of the best jockeys of the modern era, and it is not surprising that he reached this mark, which so few have reached.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical sleigh that distinguishes him from others in the brass room.
He was a great jumper, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans in this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epse, he'd have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey of out and big jumpers!
And if you're serious, Franky's been leading the winners in Britain for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character that's good for British jumpers, but more than that, he's an amazing jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a firm racing horse
From the racing finish to the racing jumps, Frankie Dettori is a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
It was a fall and a fall.
A number of large jumpers, including his famous "Veicoleptic Seven" in Ascott in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and had been disqualified for doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed tremendous will to challenge the skeptics and return to form.
And he may not have finished for some time. The Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue to participate in the competitions, at least until he was 50 years old.
Putin releases Sergei Ivanov's administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly fired his head of the administration of Sergei Ivanova.
Ivanov has been a part of the trusted close circle of Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old was now appointed as a representative of the environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “decided to free Ivanova from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President,” but did not mention the reason.
Mr. Ivanova's deputy, Anton Weino, has been appointed his successor since 2012.
Mr. Wayne, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGIMO) and served at the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later, he was the head of the President ' s protocol management and the Government ' s apparatus, reports the Kremlin website (Russian).
At the time of appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as heads of State in developing draft laws and monitoring how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin told a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released from this position and recommended that he be replaced by Wayne.
Are the smiles convincing?
It's a move that has failed Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has been one of the closest supporters of Vladimir Putin for a long time and, like him, has served in the Soviet Security Service, the KGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At the meeting with President Putin, which was shown on public television, both men stated that the head of the administration had resigned at his own will.
But despite the camera smiles, few were convinced here — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this an unforeseen consequence of any fight for power?
Until no one knows.
But the official statement is that a man who was once called a potential president suddenly wanted to govern Russian environmental policy was confronted with enormous skepticism.
In the comments of Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very difficult position, even if it is a difficult position, for four years.
Well, I've been the head of the president's administration for four and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as was Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed its deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanova one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once considered that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since Putin's third term would be contrary to the Constitution.
However, this post was taken up by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister until he returned to the presidency three and a half years later.
The star series "Think Like a Criminal" Thomas Gibson fired after the producer's dragon
Gibson was a participant in the theaters of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotner, apologized on Thursday before he was announced removal.
There were creative differences in sampling and differences in opinion.
I regret that this has happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be removed from the show that is being followed by the FBI agent team is expected to take place later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor who previously played the leading role in Darma and Greg was on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love To Think as a Criminal" and put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there before the end, but now it's impossible.
I would just like to thank the screenwriters, the producers, the actors, our remarkable team, and, above all, the best worshipers that the show could only dream of.
It is noted that the show will return with its twelfth season, 28 September.
Myth: fish landed in the Banfa Garden
A man from Banfa sought help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could have been sands left with water.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, has put up a harvest in Periskop, hoping that someone can shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
Project of 1.35 billion pounds now to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have united the northern spring and Viaduk Quinsferry Crossing, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four smacks between the "perpetual vertebrae" that are now approaching the completion of all three pilot bridges.
The Fife Bridge section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contained 10,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of bridge.
The $1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Kit Brown visited the square today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Krossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering really epic scale in this project, where over 30,000 tons of concrete have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
In spite of the massive size and weight of the bridge, the finality of the lubrication between the wire and the bridge coat is a virtual operation using extremely accurate assembly permits.
A total of about 79 per cent of the entire bridge area now on site, for the last section of the canvas, the concrete cover is being poured into the Rosite today, which means that everything is ready to be taken to the bridge.
Michael Martin, project director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first touch on each bridge project is always a significant wave.
In this amazing project, this blend is the most modern construction work.
After installing the last section of the road deck and connecting it with the expanding North Pilon road deck, we were then left to close the remaining sights on the north — or the shoreline.
This was done by pulling the north-based pipeline at 700 millimeters south.
It was a large and at the same time a very clear operation.
It is large because the 222 metre-length van is about 6000 tons long and should have been raised to about 3 per cent of the angle.
It is understandable because the permits that the team was working on were tiny — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Luckily, it all went very well.
Rescue in the Moelfr Gulf: Three men were 'lucky to stay alive '
Three men were "lucky to stay alive" after they were released from a fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station was alarmed at 13:20 in British summer time on Friday, after the team saw the incident unfolding in the Moelfr Gulf.
Three men from all over the force tried to get to a safe place while their ship continued to move.
"We saw their ship circling around with them and supposed to be the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones, a roller coaster.
"Good luck, by the time we came down to the water, the strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were saved by a local fishing vessel, and the third man was found exhausted and trapped without a lifeboat.
They were all taken aboard a lifeboat and delivered to a rescue station
Jones said, "The three men who are thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and harmless.
The boat engine had an accident extinguisher, but he somehow separated himself from the man who operated the boat when she woke up.
Someone saved these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's interesting to see how the world changes.
The fact that adolescents and children no longer go out the street to play, preferring to spend their free time watching screens, has been a complaint to many in the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people away from the couch and engages in some physical activity.
Time on the screen was initially limited by TV, then by video games and recently by smartphones.
It is so good to see that technology and street activity are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the slow involvement of Pokémon Go, an application based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (later produced a series of multifilms, playing cards and other responses).
Like many other pop-cultural events, all of this has lost its relevance a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Starting in other countries was then delayed because of the massive response that the servers had overloaded.
In the days considered, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, smartphone players are going to look for Pokemons that are tracking the GPS and, being found, they can be "photographed" (through the box on your phone) or "peaks".
The generation that played the game, being younger, joined the slow pull, ridding themselves of the savages to search.
In the United States, the game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of “normal” steps per day.
The Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which monitors 35,000 users, recently reported that within two days from the start of the game, the number of people who were tracked by them, who had performed 30 minutes daily, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing in Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data about the level.
Many health campaigns that convince people to “purchase 30 minutes”, “get up from the couch” and “to be active every day” have not found a response because most of the health messages are boring and express themselves to people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who practice regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to correct weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But Pokémon Go's pretense is that she's pushing people out on the street to do what they love.
Thus, three health bases are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends in the hunt.
As usual, there are boredoms that seek to appeal to.
And yes, someone can knock on the door.
So what?
A break-in happened.
Although smartphone applications, such as Fitbit, were able to monitor our physical activity earlier, they did not give us the motivation to exercise as this game does.
The news will arrive and use will weaken over time.
However, because of the success of Pokemon, more games will emerge, which will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good form and healthy.

Simona Bailey wins the gold of the absolute championship in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the sum.
Simon Bailey is vulnerable to all of this.
It's dynamic on the back.
Not forced into the womb.
It's a sex breaker.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympics.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of an absolute championship on Thursday, placing the gap between himself and the rest of the world in a convincing demonstration under the close attention of the Olympics.
Her general ball 62.198 was far enough away from the silver medalist and partner of the team "Finally Peterka" Eli Riceman and the Russian bronze medalist Ali Mustafina.
Bailz from the United States is performing at the gymnast during the final of the women's individual absolute championship on art gymnastics in 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bayles became the fourth-ranking American woman who won the title of the champion of absolute primacy and the fifth at all, strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps at any time.
She was upset when she was shown her final general ball and her long journey to this point ended.
This achievement puts her in the same league as very rare athletes, such as Michael Felps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Bayles has spent the last three years mastering his sport by winning 15 medals of the World Cup -- including 10 gold -- with such amazing programs in their mix of love and precision that the 1984 Olympic Championship, Mary Lou Retton, called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One final test was expected in Brazil, not so much a match between Bails and the others in this area as between her and the cargo of high expectations.
Anything less than going back to his family's home in Spring, Texas, with the worst gold medals, would be considered an unjustified expectation.
Simona Bails from the United States, left, and Eli Reisman are included after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual absolute championship for the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Bayles won the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final agreement for a farewell party in the resignation of the national collecting coordinator Martha Caroli.
While Bailey insisted that she never looked forward to the future during her long journey to the top, that was not the case.
Part of her program of free practice — including her corporate walk — is based on Latin American music, which would come directly from home on the street right outside the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was devastated by her grandfather and grandmother, starting to walk as a child and an open mother of coach Amy Burman during a visit to the classroom where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She has not lost any competition since the summer of 2013 at the absolute championship, which should continue as long as Bails would like.
Although Mustafina had a small advantage with two turns, it was peace.
Gymnastic snow and free exercises — where Bayles protects the world’s championship — are under siege.
She went out again from 15,433 to April and ended from 15,933 to sex.
Raisman gently hugged her while they were waiting for the final account — the pure formality — and the tears appeared around the shining red with white and blue eyes of Bailey, when the idea she had ever recorded in the album for cutting was realized.
Raissman's speech was a small place four years ago when she divided the third place, but she lost the bronze of Mustafin on the Thay-Break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team that Americans call "baby" was far ahead.
She sent the kisses to the crowd after her free practice covered by the return, which sometimes seemed to be the case.
As far as Bayles is concerned, the 19-year-old virus tweet from the beginning of this week is now quite new:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer case shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most deadly attack on the first serial killer of Phoenix in the last decade were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and the daughter of Ellis, Malia, were shot on 12 June, when their car was parked on the driveway, the authorities said.
The criminal made about eight shots of the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, then hiding on another vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police claim that the triple murder is apparently not the result of a robbery, since the perpetrator did not take the wallet or $2,900 that was available to one of the adult victims.
The representative of the Phoenix police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooters had motivated investigators to check whether it was related to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others were wounded as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas over four months.
"This is happening in the residential area before the house," Howard KPHO, a CBS branch, said earlier this month.
Several vehicles, including brown Nissan at the end of the 1990s, black BMW at the end of the 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln, were believed to have been used.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were related to each other and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and ended later.
Liner, 31 years old, and the daughter of Ellis, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, aimed at an empty pickup half an hour before a triple murder, which they believe was the case of a serial killer.
The investigators found the bullets and pulled the bullet out of the seat and the parts of the bullet out of the motor compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivoto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of her peers, Edmund Microcephaly is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixivot did not know when she was pregnant.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign it.
What's really not true is, of course, you're signing on it," she said.
She and her husband told Vincent that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical facility.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing that yet," said Pixyvto.
Edmund's walking through the halls.
Edmund didn't sit down and use it until he had three, and he hasn't spoken yet.
But it's slow at some stages.
He's on the sidewalk and he's on a bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth is showing the gesture that Edmund thought of "please join me."
"We're learning his sign language," said Picxivoto CBS News.
But not just the usual language of gestures, she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur as a result of a variety of different circumstances: genetics such as Edmunda, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as roots and zika.
Symptoms and projections may vary considerably.
It's too early to talk about how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Pixito remembers emotional losses because of an uncertain future.
I always told you what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven't really asked for a life-long forecast because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Pixito has a encouraging advice for mothers with congenital defects because of Zick.
It'll be better.
You know everything's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding is the cause of rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare the emergency on Friday, with even more sediments expected to fall beyond the state until Saturday.
Many rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the South of Mississippi have emerged from the shores and are threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Governor Louisiana John Bell Edwards said that public officials were in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance had already gone to the affected.
Mike Steel, a representative of the Office of the Governor for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that high water, boats and sandbags were being requested.
Styl said that only the arrival of Tanjipahoa had asked for tens of thousands of sand bags.
The danger of flooding remains in force until Saturday for most of the southern part of Louisiana.
The Weather Service stated in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could be applied to the area.
In southern Alabama, the watering trip lasted until Friday, as the rain continued to reach the Mobila area.
The Comit River near Baton-Ruzez and the Amyt River near the Springs Day, both in Louisiana, were projected to have established a record of the flood levels in the past.
Synoptic Alex Krautmann said that both rivers could drown many houses in the suburban areas near Baton-Russia.
He also said that the sinking down at Assenshen's entrance was a threat, since these inflatable rivers would slowly reach the Morpa Lake.
The Tikfo River, to hear the southern border of Mississippi state in Liverpool, Louisiana state, reached the highest ever recorded level at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
The rescuers were still drawing people out of the water in the districts of Amyt and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and passport were among those who were saved early Friday next to Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that the waters of Bever Creek, which are usually located in more than 400 feet from his home, rose quickly at night.
He said another belt that lived nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water continued to rise," said Hansford.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the greatest flow she'd ever seen in 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers saved all three by means of an army truck and delivered them to a fire station in Gloster, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood was “supply spreading”, as the rains continued, noting that officers were examining the evacuation order.
Krautmann says that one observer near Livingston reported a fall of 13.75 inches from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was oversaturated by rain from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets have led to the rescue of residents from the homes of Tangipagoa and the abolition of occupations in five school districts, the authorities say.
WWL, a branch of CBS, reports that counsellor Tanjipahoa told about 200 drowned houses.
The residents were evacuated into two churches, but they are both now flooded.
The President of the coming of Robbie Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals in high water.
The Priuts were opened in the city of Amyth and the city of Hammond to receive those who had been evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water begins to recede," he said.
In the town of Hammond, about two dozen streets were closed because of the high water level, and sandbags were available for distribution to residents in hopes that they would keep the water away from houses and businesses.
"The last major flooding we had was in March," said urban governor Lacey Landrum.
It's on its way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that the rainy rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but no one was registered on Friday.
Kate Tousson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Emit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I saw water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tauson, "and it still flies on the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "pulled out", remains alive after shooting in Philadelphia
Police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shooting at 6-year-old in the city this week.
The grandmother and grandfather of the child introduced him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandmother and grandfather say Brown received numerous gunshot wounds, including his smell, foot, hand, and life, but was aware when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot, his little body was fired with bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melandez at the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in the hospital in critical condition and has survived several operations.
The family told the station what it was expected to fix.
He had to go to first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29 and one 32.
One of the 29-year-olds is reported to be critical; two other victims were registered in a stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front seat of the car near the 29-year-old in critical condition, reports the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether any of the wounded men could be shot.
The investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shooting between several armed people.
The semi-automatic arms slags attributed to various copies of the semi-automatic weapons have been put in place.
It seems that this was certainly a long battle.
There were bricks on the street, on both sides of the road.
Therefore, it seems that there were several armed fighters there and they were actively involved in the shooting," said the captain of the Philadelphia Police Station, Anthony Ginaldi.
Many homes and cars in the area were also affected.
There were no arrests, and the police reportedly watched video surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old girl was hit in the hands of a crazy pool on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabby, and Lori
That's what I call the women's Olympic Assembly for Gymnastics this year and for a few reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts in this collective role: Simon Bayles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Ernandes, who have inspired so many blind girls.
The composition of this collection, supplemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This collection looks like America at last.
This also strengthened the black and Latin American women's presence at the top of this type of sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African American.
Last year Simon and Gabby were No.1 and No.2.
It's powerful.
The last Gabby Douglas Olympics was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
The world could now be a witness to the incredible three-time World Championship of Simona Bayles, Douglas and Lori Ernandes performances of unexpected but yet virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday Simon became the fourth American order winning gold in a woman's individual absolute championship.
And a colleague at the Ellie Reisman Congregation made a silver one.
We're going to witness this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like it in gymnastics all over the country.
Simona, Gabby, and Lori all chose the same path as Ellie and Madison to form an Olympic assembly.
They are the “final fifth” because the next Olympic gymnast will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroli's training.
But gymnastics is actually a expensive sport, and gymnastics are first trained in private gymnastics clubs supported by parents paying the cost of training, equipment, travel, form, contributions to competitions, hotel services (for coaches and their gymnastics and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are located where gymnasiums receive everything from their training, and this is a costly and long-term responsibility for gymnasium families.
Amy Burman, coach Simona Bayles, and Maggie Hanni, coach Lori Ernandes, both have been training their athletes since they took up high school.
We must create a more affordable and affordable gymnastic education for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gym fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 young urban boys (mainly black and Latin American) and trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand in Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as sustainability for boring work, discipline and mind-resistance.
This combination has a positive impact on good health, success in school and work for the rest of its life.
It is the inspiration of this congregation that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and that is wonderful.
Sports is so important, especially for girls.
Now is such a great time.
Thank you, Simone, Ellie, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in the victory of the Olympic gold team and for motivating so many girls of different origin to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Younger doctors were hired to announce further strikes following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on the change by agreeing with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July Hunt announced plans to introduce this treaty, said that NHS was on “nothing” and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first younger doctors were transferred to a new contract, which included changes in working hours at night and outputs to improve service at an out-of-hour time.
Dr. Ellen McCott, Chairman of the Committee on Young Doctors' BMA, said yesterday evening in a statement: “The younger doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it is undermining the current labour crisis and that it cannot apply to all doctors fairly.”
It was only eight weeks before the first group of doctors would be transferred to a new contract, progress was needed and time on the basis.
The WMA ' s attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with an unwillingness to take action and sometimes with full silence by the Government.
And this despite the promise of Jeremy Hunt last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremi Hantu needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of the younger doctors.
If he does not do so, then the younger doctors are sure that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The last strike at the end of April delayed about 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 nurses, while nurses and consultants were involved in providing medical replacements on the picketing line.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute on changes by agreeing an amended treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants better pay for 54,000 young doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Employers, urged younger doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: “The strikes reach little or nothing, but they put pressure on those already working outside the team and services, and cause concern, physical pain and distress to patients, seats and their families.”
During the past two months, we have spoken with the Committee of Senior Doctors and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of supervisors and corporate information policies.
Workers hoped that continued positive support on other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility of training, additional training for those who returned after a break in their career, the value of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differences in medicine, were a sign of how serious employers, the Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to meet the conditions achieved by WMA in November, February and May.
Preparation of 2 £ per day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attack are going to take advantage of the drug for £2 per day, after the authorities have recommended that it be given more people and for longer periods.
The anti-inflammatory drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated interventions for people with heart disease.
The product has already been appointed for 12 months after the heart attack, reduced risk of stroke or a new attack.
The NICE National Health Service of the United Kingdom advised that it be given to people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service of the United Kingdom has now advised that it be given to people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack takes place with about 140,000 people in England every year, and a fourth of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat on the arterial walls and the formation of flashlights.
If the lamp breaks into parts, it can cause a thrombosis that blocks access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the trumpet moves, it can move through the bloodstream and block the bloodstream to the brain, causing stroke.
People who have already been attacked are at greater risk of getting another.
The ticagrellor produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique reduces the risk by making the trombles less likely.
The draft NICE directive, published today, recommends that people give 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the existence of effective methods of secondary prevention of approximately four people who have had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke occurs, often with devastating consequences.”
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that ticagrellor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already undergone heart attack.
In advance, we are pleased to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, particularly the risk of bleeding, is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment beyond that time limit.
The culture of PC ownership allows for the falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim areas
Ex Mayor Touer Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year because of corruption, using a press release from the Government
The culture of political correctness has led to the closing of eyes, which has been turned around by the widespread falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim communities, for information from the devastating report of the Government published today.
The former member of the cabinet of ministers, Sir Eric Pickles, is in violation of criticism of the police, election observers and city administration for ignoring the evidence of election violations due to “excessive sensitivity to raciality and religion”.
The former secretary of local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that police had to be allowed to set boundaries outside the polling stations to protect the fearful voters.
He proposes that voters take personal certificates to prove who they are when they vote.
To date, voters must only indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests wearing unsweetened ink on people's fingers when they submit their ballots, in order to exclude someone from voting twice.
There is a need to provide better protection to the public, said Sir Eric.
He called for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from the more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that is leading to it," he said.
A report was made on the Downing Street as a result of a scandal with a vote in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Court, which was considering elections, decided that the current mayor, Luftur Rahman, had to be removed from office in connection with a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman “skinned” religious feelings of his Muslim community and had his critics silenced, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as it was said, “led his campaign on the basis of the duty of believers to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were cast in doubt or were the result of a person ' s personation when a person votes, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concerns about fraud by an e-mail in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for their elected candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photograph, made several recommendations on cleaning up the voting system, including the requirement to give his identity certificate to prove who you are.
His report stated: “The evidence of the pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, particularly women and youth, was presented to vote at the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There were concerns that... public institutions had closed their eyes to such conduct because of the excessive sensitivity of “political correctness” to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations for clearing the system, including removing political activists from work with postal ballots to stop the “harvest of votes”.
The report of Teresa May also calls for rigorous registration checks to prevent the use of the list of voters for immigration fraud and privileges.
An option is considered to require voters to submit a certificate of identity before the vote.
Use unsweetened ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent someone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year limitation on applications for automatic mail voting.
To remove political participants from the work of campaigners and activists with filled ballots and postal ballots.
To give the police authority to establish boundaries around the polling stations.
To amend the law in order to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation under the Constitution of the People ' s Act of 1983.
Take illegal photographs on the polling stations.
To require only English to be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Enhancing training to ensure that staff force voters to go up one by one.
Sir Eric is furiously attacking the city police, claiming that it was "defeated", that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamletts case.
“The electoral court has declassified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corruption and illegal acts,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of proof — for a number of reasons.
It also criticises the inconsistency of the "percussion checks" of the electoral divisions of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: "The best ruling of the court in Tower Hamlet was a signal for trial.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, yet the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Mindful of Kate's bicycle analogues and other two famous Olympics in Rio
The 2016 Olympic Fantasy in Rio this week came to mind on the French biker Polin Ferran-Prevo, which seemed to be impressive like the Cambridge Duke.
But the 24-year-old participant in the Olympics is not the only athlete who fights for gold this summer, who can boast of his own famous double — at least, according to reports in the Socites.
Thus, in honor of Game Rio and all the famous people who appear on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has made up a list of Olympics that have more than a superficial similarity to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: U.S. male team members Bradie Ellison, left, compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's bicycle bike, many people online have rushed to point out how a certain doll could be the twin of Leonardo DiCaprio's superstar.
A member of the U.S. male team, Bradie Allison, was the cause of a hurricane on Twitter after his images appeared that looked like a scary Volk star with Wallstreet.
And in fact, he knew about the insanity of the bastards and admitted that he heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I don't personally see a huge likeness, it could be except vegetation on the face," Brady Huffington Post said.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons in London 2012 will no doubt indicate even more this year: the striking similarity between the British pressure Greg Zaireford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, with her very expressive eyes, is said to be a true copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Stefan.
And in the pool of South Africa, Cameron Van der Burg was compared to the star of Mattie Morrison for many years.
Going to more unexpected: This user thinks that Nathan is a "sport version" of the "Start" actor
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who could be admired with similar heavy brooms and loss.
A silver medalist from Russia, Julia Efimova, can boast not only of burnt skin and bright hair but also of an actress AnnaLinn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, according to fans, resembles Joseph Gordon Levitta's "sportual version".
Cruel women: The Hope Solo football star, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same faces and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason why the couple's appearance is similar.
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to announce his warning that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical".
In fact, the U.S. football star and Dexter's actress have incredibly similar shapes of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of the actress Lori Linnie, as well as the winning gold medal by Gabby Douglas, who can admire her own beautiful broad smile, which resembles the smile of the star Gabriel Union.
CBC's Olympiad commentator apologizes for saying that the Chinese fleet "has died like a pig"
Analysis of the fourth MacDonald place in the 14th grade Ay Janhan in the women's style 4x200 m in the middle of CBC in the direct broadcast of the Olympics
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of her commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “started as he” and “dead as a pig” during the flood.
Commenter Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final female staff 4x200 m in free style.
It was possible to hear McDonald, who was attracted to the CBC's commentaries to "distribute her color," said, "This is a 14-year-old Chinese girl who has drawn a ball, a child."
Too excited, she started out like him, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
China’s 14 - year - old Ay Yanhan sailed the second stage of the esophagus at 1:57.79 — for 1.61 seconds slower than Canada’s Taylor Rock, allowing the Canadians to remove the distance from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly to the network after being shaken by tone and expression
Emmett McFallain tweeted, "Did the CBC actually just say that a 14-year-old sailor from China 'died like a pig'??"
This idiot didn't realize they were still in the air."
About Ay Janhan from China at the Women's Estraphate 4x200 m in free style, they said, "This is a 14-year-old Chinese girl who won the ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately hit the Bayron McDonald, and many called for him to be fired.
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sara Paradiz, wrote: 'Nothing to yourself #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who was delivering the CBC, apologized in the direct air for McDonald's comment, saying, 'We are sorry that the comment on the landing was made in the air.'
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.
ALL have concluded that more than 90 people have apologized for the statement.
Scott Russell's friend had to apologize to McDonald
CBC then copied and apologized to over 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
The body was also quick to apologize and make a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to enter the air.
Last night we acted quickly to apologize to our audiences in the direct air and our subscribers in the neighborhood.
Let's make it clear that the Beyron's comments were about a swimmer's speech, not about her personality.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald apologized in a direct atmosphere and tried to clarify his comment, stating that he did not think his words were interpreted as an attack on his identity.
'I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the female staphyte',' he said on the broadcast of the CBC Olympics.
'I was talking about a sailor's speech, not about her personally.'
'I understand for myself that there was no disrespect, and I am very sorry.'
The Buyer Primark insulted a woman who unscrupulously imitated the lower white in the middle of the store
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman found out to look at the shirts on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she imitated what she looked like, rocked them, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually died of four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkston.
Primark Shop of Bouverie Place Trade Centre in Folkston, where a woman was wearing t-shirts before putting them back on the pole
The mother of the two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after the example of the low white woman, the mysterious woman had once again “dressed and left the store without buying anything”.
She said: "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the hall, she took a couple of shirts from the window, took off her own ankles and shirts and wore them.
"She didn't try to find somewhere else to do it -- she was just standing there without complaining."
"They all stopped when she took off the shirts again, and they obviously didn't like her because she put them back on the pole."
She did the same with three other couples before finally deciding that there was nothing that she liked, dressed, and left.
"It doesn't look like she was worried about who was watching her, or that she thought about the man who eventually bought these rabbits that she'd seen."
The 33-year-old Jenny Davidson of Kent said, "How do you think someone's going to take a rabbit's house that someone's already wearing, and they weren't thrown away?"
It happened on Tuesday.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to get these items out of sale after she left -- well, better."
"I don't want to come home with a new couple of women's rabbits and find out that the other woman was wearing them and taking them off, and they weren't raped."
The representative of Primark reported: "Primmark knows about the incident that happened in our store in Folkston on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the goods concerned were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Gun Attacks Using a Cow
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Misrachi, the head of the federation of the maga in New York to find out how to deal with the armed robbers at a close distance.
Whether they approach you in front of you or behind you, this video will show you how to beat the kidnapper with his own weapon.
If they approach the back, according to Misrachi, the first thing they have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and "open the line of fire."
Then you'll take a strong shot of a gun between your forehead and your shoulder before you hit them in the face with a free bow.
Then you should blow your knees in the breath, and as long as the attacker turns away from the pain, you shake the gun out of his hand, hit him in the face and walk back, holding the gun on him.
For an armed, fit forward, the way you do it looks like - get your body off the fire line, quickly catch the gun and shake it so that the thief can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight of the gun and hit the bullet in the chest, then pull the gun out of its grip before you go back and aim at it.
Does it sound complicated?
Look at the video to see how that's what Misrazi is doing.
But remember, the safest way to get out of any robbery -- if you're not a master of the maga -- is to give up your cash.
Traveller Jan Wright speaks his language in the most filthy places in Europe
The British traveler has undergone a serious test of his immune system and a ruddy reflective test, resulting in some of the most filthy and repulsive places in Europe.
The leader and author of the book on travels by Jan Wright, 51, from Saffolk, conducted the euro banknote, the Perils of Circa Piccadilla, the unitage of the train and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before approaching each object, he used a luminometer to show us what he's going into.
But the experiment, which should be a film entitled "The Traveller-Lizun Guide to the Internal Force", produced some surprising results.
The idea of licking the garbage button on a train used by thousands of others may be extremely repulsive, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen.
During the entire trip across Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and nurses about the increase in oxygen bacteria and their own health.
Luckily, none of the wounded brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for the tests on the strength of his backpack, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public wash to unitase wipe button, this task has undoubtedly tested its immune system.
In the film he filmed, he said, "From childhood I was completely unconcerned about my health, and I put a lot of stuff in my mouth from the earth, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused is a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test fat showed the value of a luminometer exceeding 4,000 units.
For comparison: just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to go down after his luminometer was worth more than 4,000 units, while the washed hands show less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio recorded a film about a traveler called "The Guide to the Internal Force of Traveller-Lizuna", which demonstrates the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the toilet
In the movie he said, "This is close to one of the worst things I ever smoked in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to do anything 'cause it's ominous.
The Guide to Internal Force Traveller-Lizuna was taken together with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygenic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of oxygenated human bacteria and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice-President Valio on snacks, juices and new categories of Niko Vuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time explain the benefits of the probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "give Jan a call."
They claim that interest in the health of the lawnmower is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to place them in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the health of the insect and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in the health of the baker is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information about this in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was director of the film, added, "Let's say I'd lose respect for Jan, if he had some things that I asked for, for example, a disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, some things made it easier for John to get close and some were rather harsh.
I'm glad that some of these scars we've been able to sleep in a cage.'
During the survey conducted in 2015, 84 per cent of respondents linked oxygen-depleting bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and bladder, and 58 per cent said that they used at least occasionally products containing added oxygen-depleted bacteria.
The Huligan family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall municipal house, before eviction
The Huiligan family left their municipal home with a loss of £ 50,000 after they had been evicted for intimidation of their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilkok, were expelled from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forced out of the property, the shocked housing and construction cooperatives found this property in a condition that required repair.
The walls had been left with the sawing holes, the half was opened, the trash had been scattered over the floor, and the walls had been scratched with graffiti.
The family is now moved and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna McEvoy, a resident of Cornwall Houseing, said she was afraid that she wouldn't save him.
She said, 'That was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live that way.
There are many things that need to be weighed, because this property will probably be known as the not very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys stupid glory, and their name is called stupid glory.
A couple of three sons who lived in real estate from time to time, and the police reported that the reign of terror caused by the family included fighting in the streets with baseball bats, intimidation of the nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive shouting, disputes and abuse.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behavior in June.
In a few rooms of the house, which could be taken down, there was an old trash.
Sex boards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were exhausted
Neighbors say they saw dragons on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Houseing forced her and her partners to leave the house this week after they had been granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The eviction was welcomed by neighbors who said that their lives had been turned into the essence of hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care."
We lived with them for 20 years, and that was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is incredible.
'That morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we didn't get used to it!
Now that they've finally left, it's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Neighbourhood Group, said that the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in a house for 20 years, with the police and regularly called the police
Mossor and old toys were thrown down on the left-hand side of the municipal house
He added: 'It is a disgrace that the tenant could not accept any responsibility for the conduct of her and her family, since eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, since the conduct was limited and their actions must have been horrifying to her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to give us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a signal that social behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but he said they all had a little more 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the burned houses after eviction
Dwelling workers will now have to remove the breasts of the garbage that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police conducted a search in the house and found more than 70 g of rope, as well as weights, related supplies and £1700 cash.
Skeldon was fined after he recognized himself guilty of possession of Class B drugs for delivery.
She stated that the money was going to pay for her son's funeral, Lee Skoldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After making them homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in the house were smashed with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to evict tenants who are not subject to the rental rules
Angela Crow, from Devon and Cornwall police, said that this eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they can be brought to justice without being accused of it, as well as to those who are harmed by it,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a low - flying warplane barely touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro, Portugal, tourists who love sundial were terrified of their lives
P-3C Orion Air Force P-3C Portugal flew incredibly low
Air Force reported that it had conducted a training flight but insisted on a lack of security risk
That's the moment when frightened tourists start panicking, while the moment when a low - flying plane flew over the overcrowded beach.
The dramatic scene shows a warplane flying from the sand catchers in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Breathing leaped on their feet as soon as they became for some reason concerned with the noise of the aircraft's engines, but unable to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident happened last night not far from the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandesh, one of the few resters who posted the video of the shocking spring in social media, said, "He flew down quite twice, and there was a moment when it was some time that he was going to break up."
Nuno Arroja added, "I took care of the serfing and I swear, it was such a feeling that the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the Aveiro beach were terrified when the plane showed up from the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the P-3C Orion aircraft was flying a training flight to find fishing vessels at the shore and was forced to relax so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said that the plane flew a little lower than usual due to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby hot forests, but the military forces insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, forest fires damaged Portugal ' s motherland and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low due to circumstances — dense fog and power from forest fires, which had deteriorated visibility
The flight was conducted by a training flight and the pilot was ordered to find fishing boats within the mission
The HASP system has been mandatory for more than a year, but most of the coffee and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet been implemented.
Checks are becoming more active, and the business is threatened with fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system has been a risk analysis and critical control points for food manufacturers and carriers, as well as companies in Russia as members of the Customs Union (TS).
In February 2015, the checks carried out by the Business Monitor in accordance with these standards began in Petersburg.
But so far, officials have issued fines only for certain violations of the regulation (see “A list of documents”...).
In general, the failure to implement the regulation will result in an enterprise of 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HASP as a system that took into account the risks and risks of working with and preventing food, developed in the United States in the 1960s.
Then it was about food security for astronauts.
The system is now being used not only in the United States but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASP has been operating on TS territory.
The development and implementation of the business system was 4 years old (the requirement of HASP appeared in the TS regulation 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the rule applies only to food products, not to restaurants, - explained by the head of the Social Council of Elena Certel.
Now everyone's trying to get lost.
The expected deadline for the resumption of charter travels to Turkey, at the end of August, is beginning in September.
But they won't raise a question of curiosity, because their target audience -- the family with children -- is already preparing for school, the experts say.
Yesterday, the Alliance of Tourist Agencies sent a letter to the Government requesting that the charters be authorized.
“For many Russian tourists, the choice of quality and accessible sea vacation is unresolved, as most accommodation facilities are already banned in the resorts of Krasnodar and the Republic of Crime by the end of September”, notes the authors and stresses that opening of charters in August does not have a significant impact on the demand for Russian sea tourism.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union of Tourism (RST), if Russian and Turkish aviation authorities agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of when the charters will be renewed as far as possible depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even in August, if the tour operators quickly set up programmes and agree with the airlines on board," said Pavel Romanians, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office of the RST.
He said that the possible resumption of charters was good news, but did not have much impact on the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - had already returned from vacation and had been prepared for school or had been given leave in other countries.
During the summer season, mostly single travellers and couples buy tours.
Charter programmes can count on those who have the opportunity to take a spontaneous rest," said Paul Romanians.
"Turkey has a chance to attract many tourists, if it will now offer very budget proposals -- 50-60 thousand rubles for two tours, because there are people who are looking forward to very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosental, Director General of Optio-Travel.
In another case, it is certainly not worth counting on the rest of the day - the main mass of travel is already planned.
Paul Romanians also believe that since there is a demand for regular trips to Turkey, the charters will also be cut, but there is no need to wait.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters is now a repetition of the next season," said Paul Romanians.
"The opening of charters in Turkey is a positive news for the next season," said Valeria Rubzov.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from NDAFs established by law from compensation payments within the limits of approved standards relating to compensation for damage caused by injury or other damage to health.
The issuing of milk to workers employed in work with harmful working conditions is provided for in section 222 of the FMR.
Accordingly, the norms and conditions of extradition were laid down by the order of the Russian Mining Development No. 45 of 16.02.2009.
According to this document, the free issue of milk or other equivalent foodstuffs is made by workers on days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions due to harmful production factors at the workplace.
On the basis of those rules, the Russian FNC concluded in the letter under review that, pursuant to paragraph 2(3), 217 FNRs were exempt from the NDF's milk-value incomes issued to workers in the days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Standards and conditions approved by the Order of the Russian Mining Development of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
Moscow's Gastrobank has no license.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew the licence for bank operations with the credit organization of the Share Commercial Bank "GAZSTROIBANK" registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, the GAZSTROIbank AKB has conducted high-risk credit policies related to the placement of money in low-quality assets.
Adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank's assets have given rise to the credit institution's grounds for implementing bankruptcy prevention measures.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in suspicious transit operations.
The Bank shall appoint a temporary administration for a term of office until the date of appointment of a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization are suspended in accordance with federal laws.
AKB GAZSTROYBANK is a contributor to the deposit insurance system.
It is recalled that the payment of an insurance refund to bank investors, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Law No. 177-FZ on the Insurance of Individuals' Deposits in the Banks of the Russian Federation, provides for a balance of 100%, but not more than 1.4 million Rubs in total per investor.
Payments according to the Deposit Insurance Agency will start no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the report, 335 seats in the FF banking system were held on 1 August 2016 by AKB "GAZSTROIBANK" as assets.
A London schoolgirl who joined IGIL died in Syria
Cadiz Sultan, one of three British schoolchildren who left London last year to join IGIL, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akundji said her family learned about her death in Rakke, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is supposed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqka, the area of grouping in the country, as ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she was planning to leave the war country and return to England.
"It can only be hoped that the only advantage of all of this is that it is a funeral and a testament to others, that it is the risks involved when travelling to the war zone, to convince people to make the same choice at any time," Akunji said.
In February 2015 Sultan and two other students from East London were on a plane to Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family said she married IGIL in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reed claims that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge in the event of election
The leader of the Democrats in Senate, Harry Reed, said he was convinced that a democratic candidate in President Hillary Clinton would appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president.
The members of the Senate blocked Garland's approval, and President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Mitch McConnell Senate said that the next president would choose the man who could replace the last Judge of the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reed said Thursday at the conference bell that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "by some degree of confidence".
Mrs. Reed later said that he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to raise Garland and just make assumptions.
He commended Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want to "spare a boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States District Court of Appeal.
Reed said that Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination were "appropriate" and "persons" of the Republican candidate in President Donald Tramp.
He said that Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treatments states that erotic calendars for “women, as well as for men”
The Journal of Treats collaborates with photographer David Bellmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of being famous, they are aimed at finding the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with museums.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of rich models is different from old-fashioned Playboys, because Playboy is for men.
I'm doing it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar too.
"We need to return to the exhibition of an eternal and classic entwined figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a woman's body," said Shaw in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women would like to be part of this project because it is a wonderful art.
Models can take photos online or in open cages in Los Angeles and New York.
They'll give Moscow some memories of unscrupulous Internet stores.
In Moscow, they are going to release a memory that will tell us how not to become a victim of the Internet store.
That's what they reported in Rosusłanzore, writes M24.
It is reported that experts from the agencies are preparing a memory that will help citizens to choose the Internet store correctly and identify possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure provides for several sections.
These will be common information and legislative frameworks, rules on the supply of goods, ways of protecting their legitimate rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to correct the claim and so on," said Rosusłannazor.
The memory is being prepared so far.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the Planter's Watch in Moscow, also planned to release a printed version and to distribute it to the mosquitoes.
MID Russia issued a statement calling the name of the second suspect in organizing a diversion in Crimea.
Persons from Ukraine and Russia have been detained, assisting in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them are Mr. Evgenian Alexandrovich and Mr. Andrei Romanovic.
"They all give acknowledgeable testimony," says the report.
The former resident of the Zaporozh area of Evgeny Panov, who was detained for suspecting the organization of acts in Crimea, confessed his guilt for questioning.
FAS costs Google 438 million rubles.
The Russian Federal Antitrust Service (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on the Google corporation of 438 million rubles, says the department's website.
"The fine for Google's violation of antitrust legislation amounted to 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine soon," said FAS Deputy Director Alexei Dozenko.
During the FAS investigation, it was found that Google provided smartphones to manufacturers sold in Russia, the Google Play app store only provided that other corporate app will be installed on the device.
These annexes also include a search system to be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates section 10 of the “Competitive Protection” (disuse of the dominant position).
We are confident that compliance with the regulation will enable competition on the mobile market in Russia to develop, which will benefit our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act should be respected by all companies whose products are placed on the territory of the Russian Federation and by transnational corporations, including," noted the Head of the Communications and Information Technology Management Office of the Russian Federation, Elena Zaeva.
The Ministry suspects 16 Russian stores.
The New Book Network was fined for selling the book "50 days before my suicide."
The New Bookshop network for the sale of State Kramer's book "50 days before my suicide," reports Moscow City News Agency.
As reported in Rosuszar, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be viewed as “provocative or motivational for the suicide of children and adolescents”.
The district court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products to children and decided to impose a fine in the form of a fine of 49 copies of the printed product seized by the administration of the Rosary.
The source of the New Book confirmed that it was Stace Kramer.
In March this year, it was reported that Moscow's largest bookstores were carrying out checks on the book "50 days before my suicide."
There's going to be a night in Moscow to remember Ernst the Unknown.
In Moscow there will be a night of memory of the sculptor Ernest Unknown, the TASS reports.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central Literator House.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States.
It was therefore decided to set up this evening for those who wanted to mention it on their native land," said the Russian Jewish Congress press service.
There they noted that it was important to the widow of Anna Graham and his friends all over the world.
In the evening, close friends of the Unknown, including Evgenian Eutushenko, artist Boris Messerer, GMI President Irina Antonov, director Mark Rosovski, as well as Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinski, head of Moscow Culture Department Alexander Kibovski, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Printatnik.
It was previously reported that the families of Ernst Not known are planning to carry out a Panichid on a sculptor in New York by 14 August.
The final consumer was guilty of: who actually buys the plates?
The single men of the Middle Ages love guilt.
And as long as you have not been allowed to interfere with the comment section of the commentaries with gross insults under the pseudonyms of the Men of the Middle Ages, this claim derives from the actual data.
According to YeGov, the so much debated recovery of plastics is not caused by the boom of the two-month generation that want to penetrate a new material object, but by the nostalgia of the middle years.
Those who have recently purchased a wine album c most of the probability are 45 to 54 according to the data.
Moreover, those of the 18-24-year-old group are least likely.
This is also not simply an act of love, which is emotionally important: older buyers are more likely to keep their feelings on their own (56%) and enjoy their loneliness (69% vs 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk through the center of Soho's relived street, in a humble serum of costume and horticulturalize before the stop, laying hands and saying something exciting, "Yes, let's see."
Yeah, let's see.
While Soho’s heart slowly fades away from its charms and possessions — hotels, cafes, and shops in Paperchasse have now filled the buildings once occupied by independent sellers — several musical shops with fantastic specialists have remained.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene where I'm close to different people in some of these stores and try to evaluate their age and emotional mood through observation.
The native of Glazgo Stuart, 55 years I went from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably more than 20 years old), in London on the afternoon to meet, and walk around the shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I think so," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 bottles.
These posters shown above (he sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), walk through the walls of his guest.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles is partly due to his available income: he can now buy the plates he could not afford when they only went out and buy the items he sold when he was young and in the mill.
"Many of what I buy is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plastics are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
It's my fault.
Wez, 25 years old who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets are in line with the profile of YouGov.
He noted, however, the new concern of people who were affected by the noise in the media, people who heard about the return and felt an obligation to buy their old plates.
According to the conversations I had, people were released from their collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their fault to buy compact discs are now selling their compact discs to buy their patches," he says.
This may explain the origin of a certain age among the returnees.
What about the emotional importance of the plastics?
It is enough to spend a few seconds in a store, such as Phoenix, to understand that plastic shops offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wezza, some senior clients, in particular, are being abused by the payment system.
Some wine lovers may feel a shock from the digital world and prefer to move away from the well-known envelopes for plastics, items that arouse memories of unscrupulous youth.
"I think that sometimes it can be a filling of waste or a possession of material things as a kind of comfort," Wez says.
Because I'm a collector, I have it, and I think many people have it.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We're like their social workers," said a colleague from the plastic store.
The ICM survey in April showed that almost 50 per cent of the people who bought the wine album last month had not heard it.
The survey also found that 41 per cent had a player they never used, while 7 per cent of those who bought the product did not have a plastic player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look very busy, with the bosanos.
The "Trophene" aspect of rebirth is what Johnny, 42 years old who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came up recently and said, "I don't have a plastic player, but I want to buy a radiohead so we can put it to ourselves," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More composition, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a plastic player."
They're younger people, not older, they're a little less than 20 people who just know about it.
Fopp, who now takes almost all the floor of the wine, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There's a couple of 70, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less unencumbered than in the above-mentioned shops — the latest synth and sex pop Wild Beast, not jazz improvisation — it is pleasant to see the diversity in its customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to establish a painful psychological trauma that lasted 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleonora, 27 years old, had been on Fopp for several minutes, considering the various plates available for sale.
She's looking at goods, not spending money.
She doesn't earn much, she says, so it's not a very good option to collect the plates.
It's worth it.
Listening to music on a computer or another device -- simple, but the beauty of the wine -- it's ..." -- it's loaded into dreams with a breath filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really unrepeatable.
My last stop was a store that, as they say, contributed to the emergence of a new generation of lovers guilty of: City fashion.
While I'm making an illusion that I'm looking at ginsy binding shorts, I'm watching a bunch of teenage girls, every minute they gather around the Polaroid chamber, before their father and his daughter start discussing buying Crosley.
On the left is a staircase with a wall of Adel, Jeffa Bakli, Amy Waynes and Flitwood Mack plastics: a modern-style blend of classics, binding plastics for any medium-sized collection.
No one sees — perhaps because they are simply decoration, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's this bad-ass guilt.
However, given that any attention to these objects could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the depth of Soho for a while, almost nothing to complain about.
It is no wonder that the layer of population with more probability than most have more time and money than most is the layer that spends most money on luxury items, such as guilt.
But as long as my conclusions show that yougov's results are accurate, at least in Soho plastic shops, they do not rule out the existence of a huge number of women collectors and lovers of wine that exist in reality, in plastic shops and online forums.
These people are probably working at school or in offices.
But they obviously don't spend the morning on Thursday, walking around the shops of plastics on Bervik Street, prosthetic plastics and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake leader who writes on the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland polar shark — the most long-lived belligerent animal — video record
Scientists say the Greenland polar shark has the longest life span of all the world's bellows.
Julius Nilsen, who is studying these sharks, claims that the record has put the female from 272 to 512 years of age and length of five meters
The French court rejects the proposal to take a shop to the Jungli refugee camp
The French court rejected the proposal of the Kale authorities to remove dozens of shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court hearings this week, the Kale authorities said that the State should be able to remove a total of 72 shops where people in the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to sell or sell tea for 50 cents (40c) or simple dishes for several euros in private restaurants.
The Cale Prefecture said that these places should be removed because they were a parallel economy that did not pay taxes and because they were at risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vitally necessary, claiming that free vessels offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp.
They said that shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those in need.
The Lila Court ruled that there was no legitimate reason to expel the people who managed 72 shops, but stated that the problems of the Cala Prefecture “were fully understood”.
Judge Jean-François Mola said that bakeries, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely shady conditions."
He said that spaces provided peaceful points for meetings of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat was the Children ' s Book of Jungle at the camp, which worked for no benefit and offered 200 lunches a day, English- and French-speaking sessions and asylum consultations for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escort to the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the child's coffee.
A letter sent to the Guardian stated that its closure would be “a disaster for these children, some of whom are not more than eight years old”.
Two charitable agencies, the Refugee Assistance and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of people in the Jungle camp had increased and exceeded 9,000 — the highest in all history — after a sharp increase in the number of new arrivals during the summer.
Micro-area libraries invite young volunteers to get to know programs.

Britain stays on the silver in Regby-7 after the Fiji Master's Class allows them to take gold
The impressive series of Great Britain in Regby-7 was severely halted by the Fiji team at the end of Thursday evening, when they were completely destroyed 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has given the master-class in the control of the ball, the spade, the retreats, the support of the game, the running of the lines and the rough force to win gold — their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was not too poor in the form of a silver one in Britain per day, and they could be proud of their efforts at the first Regby-7 Olympic tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on their way.
The sick beat of Boxes, 7-5 in the semifinal earlier that day, could be returned to negatively affect them in the final.
But no matter what, Fiji has won the best team of 15 in this form.
This may be a comfort to Britain — but probably not — that at least one Britishman will hang on a gold medal’s neck tomorrow: Chief Coach Fiji Ben Ryan, former British chief of Wimbledon.
This was some kind of trip to Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they lost all of them.
These blows will cause pain, but progress is devastating.
Fiji began great, for fun attempting to catch the ball in Britain.
It was like hitting a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Ocean Collinsau entered the corner.
With four minutes at the time, Jerry Tuwa added another tachydoon on the right flank, which was realized.
12-0 and the United Kingdom barely touched the ball.
The great attempt to capture Mitchell kept Leon Nakarov from killing a third, but that only held Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jasa Veremaloua made a rounddown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the restart and there were still more minutes... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravova then broke through a few more major attempts to capture Britain, and the storm took the line to get his father.
Implementation led to 29-0 breaks.
It seemed as if Fiji were born to play in Regby-7, while Britain still owns a craft.
That's a great deal of it.
Great Britain has made massive replacements for half the game, and they've got a Fijian lady... for all four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton picked up an attempt for Britain to make a tachdown in the left corner to make the account 36-7, but the game took a long time on the way to the islands of the South Sea, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the thrones.
It was impossible to admire Fiji's full joy.
Mother William has decorated a Fijian cake that did not need to be decorated, another attempt in the last few seconds.
It sounded like a whistle, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, totally defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in its semifinals, and Britain went a little way through South Africa in a tense semifinal to each of them, the difference in British implementation.
Kyle Brown pulls the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great work, broke his leg and killed under the beams in the second half.
The final attempt to capture Marcus Watson, the 15th brother of the English team, Antony, finally won a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning were inspired to win the gringles of a cancer coach.
There won't be any more exciting gold in these games, and that's what he's talking about.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy gains in history, Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning found their added value in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who held the beads, there were three votes in the boat, the echo coach Robin Williams had always been as long as they were striving for the second order of the Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the British sports annals that reached such height.
Their superiority was absolute, and in the end it was their 39th unconquerable speech, again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant sportsmen on the surface with the elegance of the bees do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
After every gold battalion of ready hands that contribute to progressive gains that are important and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who had been diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago did not know whether he would experience before seeing that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
This could have been a pretty bad situation.
It's a little bit of changing your species for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
It was lucky that he was able to start treatment early in 2014 in the interseasonal season, keeping the break of the schedule minimal if this could be a correct expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed pay, so I needed to fix it quickly.
It was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital and was playing at the office — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they were talking enough.
That's how it starts.
The handle itself is a journey, but it does a little more.
In the next instant after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking to hear more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own concerns.
Stanning, the captain of the Artillery Police with the service in Afghanistan behind his shoulders, said, "I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe it's a bit of a crossroads, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much that means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin too.
These were fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we'd be no one, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I could not ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning didn't lose any race in five years.
This couple is at a tense rate that their competitors could never match.
Even at the last 500 metres when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were in a big phase.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
Now it's very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do something amazing.
We weren't waiting for fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to get a good bite and get out and win this race that we did.
Couples will need a year to decide their future.
Glover has to be at the wedding next month, at her own TV screened by Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government extended the time limit for the destruction of authorized products
By the end of 2017, the Government had extended the time limit for the destruction of foodstuffs prohibited from entering Russia.
The decision was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, published on the Official Legal Information Portal.
The embargo on countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was imposed in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban has been extended several times, now in force until 31 December 2017.
Russian imports of certain agricultural products, commodities and foodstuffs from the United States, the Euro-Union countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein are prohibited.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, marine products, vegetables, fruit and milk products were prohibited.
The use of food imported into the country into the embargo is being carried out in Russia since August 2015.
Only for the 1st quarter of 2016, around 100 tonnes of banned products were removed from the sale.
The hunt for "ban"
On Friday, there are rains and droughts in Moscow.
The capital region will pass through the atmosphere front, which will bring sediment and lower air temperature.
The air rises to 25 degrees in the day.
Yes, on Saturday night in Moscow, there will be short-term rain, possible dangers and wind breaks up to 15 m/s.
The day is expected to rain up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains are also predicted in Orlov, Kursk and Voronez areas, reported by Dni.ru.
For the next working week, the landings are unlikely.
The WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
Import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia upon accession to the WTO.
"This is the first case where the WTO has taken a decision against the RF," says the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the Euro Union did not provide sufficient evidence that the Russian measures were “systematic” or “complete”.
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators soon.
This is reported by the Russian Mineconomy Development.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to appeal to the World Trade Organization for action by Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in a statement by the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the conduct of the United States in resolving the issues at issue in WTO undermines the principles of discussion.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the Euro Union and other WTO members for refusing to approve the second term of South Korean Judge Chan Son Hwa.
Russia will therefore not address the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions against the FP.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now comprises 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
In the administration of the President, the manager changed
Russia's President Vladimir Putin appointed the head of his own administration, former Deputy Sergey Ivan Ivan Weinno.
Vladimir Putin moved to the President ' s administration and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and of the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Weinno said during the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work that he had begun in the post of President Ivanov ' s head of administration and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Earlier, the Reports said that experts considered the situation of the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of manager of the administration of transparency and understanding and reorganization would not change anything in principle in the administration of the Kremlin.
They note that the leader who worked in the President ' s administration for a long time has effectively set up the AP.
Instead, the deputy head of the administration of Anton Weino came, a man who was well aware of the specificity of the work.
In Poland, they're saying they won't buy gas at the Gazproma.
The Polish oil company PGNIG does not rule out that after a few years of gas supply from the FP, it may become intractable to it due to the reorientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company Boguslav Manzez.
His words are transmitted by TASS.
"It can happen that we won't buy gas at all (Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main routes of delivery for us will become the East, the commodity from the SPG terminals and Norway," said Manzetz.
Gasprom is currently dominant in gas supplies in Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had placed almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, which was 30% higher in 2015.
The share of Russian gas giants in PGNIG's procurement increased to 49.8% compared with 40% earlier.
Recall that on 22 July, the Polish antitrust agency did not agree to the establishment of a joint venture of Gazproma and its European partners on the construction of the pipeline "North Stream-2".
This month, Poland left a request for Gasprom to deliver 11 billion cubic metres of gas on the North Stream-2.
This was said by the Vice-Chairman of the management of Alexander Medvedev.
The North Stream-2 auction will take place in 2017 and the auction is scheduled to take place on its site in the autumn of 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action in connection with the Polish party ' s intention to refuse long-term gas contracts from Russia after 2022, said the Vice-President of the government of Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the 1st quarter of this year, the Polish had only increased to 42 per cent the purchase of gas from the FP.
Gazproma added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG itself made a statement to the Stockholm Arbitration Court did not mean that negotiations had not yet been terminated.
The Polish company had previously appealed to the court to obtain a reduction in the purchase price for Russian gas.
It was recalled that the Polish government ' s gas and energy infrastructure authority, Petr. Naimsky, informed that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the gas supply contract with Gasprom.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the authorized Government of Poland on gas and energy infrastructure, Petri Niemsky, stated that six years later his country could refuse to deliver blue fuel from the east.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian Shelf.
"North Stream-2" provides for the construction of two pipelines with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia in Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The Special Monitoring Mission (SMI) of OSCE has increased the number of observers around Ukraine ' s border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first SMM lockup in Ukraine by Alexander Hughes.
"I can confirm that the MMF has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, responding to the relevant question of journalists, conveys the “RIA News”.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is peaceful, security-affected incidents are not recorded there.
Observers were tracking three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
There was a video on the ground at the Ufa airport of the Jak-42 passenger plane, which ran outside the 400-metre runway and landed on the left wing.
The video was released by the 360 television channel.
The CPC took place at 4.30 a.m. in Moscow.
Crassavia's flight arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place where there were no victims.
Only the aircraft was transported to the station.
Ufy Airport is operating in a normal way.
The Privy Investigation Office on the Transport of the CRA was responsible for the sharp landing of the liner.
The United Nations is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in the areas held by rebels in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Stefan de Mistura, considers it undisputed.
Such statements were made at the beginning of the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations to begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists have launched an investigation into reports on the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on the use of toxic gas, allegedly chlorine, was presented on 2 August.
At that time, the opposition stated that in the area where the Russian military and transport helicopter had been first bombed, the aircraft dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow these charges had been dropped.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence accused the opposition group Harakat Nour ad-Din az-Zinki.
It soon became known that two bombs were launched by toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later I felt the smell of gas, the burning of the eyes, the difficulty in breathing," he quoted the words of a visionary.
At least 7 people died as a result of the attack, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of the poison gas is confirmed by experts, actions will be considered as a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: “The evidence that this really happened is a lot.”
The prohibition of the use of chlorine for military purposes is contained in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015, human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of the use of Syrian army chlorine against “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo complicates the day-to-day shooting of its areas, and terrorists prevent people from getting out of the city.
As Reuters reports, the UN expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian break” in military action.
The current system of daily three-hour silence in the organization is considered "insufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians who have been hunted".
Counsellor Staffan de Mistoura on Humanitarian Affairs, Jan Egelann, said that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to provide assistance and evacuation from the city to the sick and injured every week.
"We have to send bulk goods from the colonized trucks to places where the roads are almost destroyed and what remains is abandoned," Mr. Egelann said.
Consultations between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian break” continue in Geneva.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing fight against Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia, announced on 11 August that a three-hour ceasefire regime would be in place, which would take effect every day from Thursday.
The establishment of "humanitarian windows" is designed to ensure conditions for the delivery of drugs, food and items of the first need into the city.
The decision of the FMF was taken in the light of increasing international pressure on Moscow, requiring the military operation to be withdrawn and facilitating the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of the series of explosions in the Thai resorts, four people were killed.
A few explosions immediately broke out in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
The attack killed four people, wounded 19.
The explosion was in the city of Hua-Hin.
Ten foreigners were found among those affected, four-State nationals were not Russians.
The responsibility for the incident had not yet been taken over by any terrorist groups, but the IMF had hurriedly declared that Islamists were not involved.
Several people have already been detained for suspected explosions.
According to the preliminary local police, the magnitude and specificity of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leader.
The attacks took place in popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the area of Phuketa and the city of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat-Tani.
Following the arrival of the military junta to the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few sectors that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, with 1.5 million more in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attack have already been detained, police officer Chris Patanacharoen reported.
As soon as he spoke of the goal, he added, but in the CDM countries “it is certain that they are not related to international extremist groups”.
Too early to make conclusions, Mr. Patanacharoen said.
But we know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact they are local diversions, and we are trying to identify the individuals behind them.
The explosions occurred on the day of the birth of Queen Thailand Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy one of its main priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to police general Scythia Srisopacharoenrat, the bombs were bombed remotely with a difference in half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on lively streets filled with restaurant eaters.
It is already known that one of the four deaths was a Thai girl who was selling street food.
The remaining victims are unknown, but they are known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, four of them were German citizens, three of whom were submitted to the Netherlands, two of whom were Italian and Austrian citizens.
Russians are not the victims of the explosions, the Rosturism press reported.
Local experts also linked the explosions to the referendum of 7 August, in which 61.4 per cent of the country ' s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the Commission for the Development of a Constitution appointed by the military junta.
The voter had to determine whether they supported the system in which the upper House of Parliament was fully appointed as military and had a significant role in the election of the Prime Minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Remember, on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the commander of the Pryut Chan Eye Army.
In his view, the army had raised an ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military set up the National Council of Peace and Order, introduced command time and censorship, set up the protesting and high court of Parliament.
How Bangkok proved to be in an emergency
The Government of Thailand, headed by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat in January 2014, announced the introduction of an emergency situation in Bangkok and adjacent to the capital of the provinces.
The special regime was extended for 60 days.
How two explosions have been made in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions took place at the centre of Bangkok at the Monument of Victory, where one of the main protests took place, resulting in 28 people being affected, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions were made unknown on motorcycles.
The authorities stepped up security in the capital and attracted military forces to protect demonstrators.
The dry log began to develop.
As “U” has become known, the Government has been invited to agree on the draft terms of the auction on the gold mining site of Sukha Log, with the maintenance of two key constraints.
The auction is proposed not to allow companies with 25 per cent or more of the aliens and applicants with no less than 25 per cent of the attendance.
The industry did not expect the Government to rewrite the conditions, noting that many players were not at risk for a complex and expensive project.
Auctions can be announced in August and held in October.
The Government has introduced a draft order and auction conditions for the largest undeveloped gold mining site in Russia, Suhai Log (Irkutian area, stocks and resources of 130 million U.S.), which has two sources of "U " known to the situation.
The project was introduced in the middle of the evening, one of which is clear.
The project had been introduced to the Government by “U”.
The representative of the smoker's non-use of Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Cloponin said "U", that the project had not yet been implemented in the officer's unit.
"The auction may be announced already in August, immediately after the Government's order has been issued, and in view of the deadline for the collection of applications for potential participants (at least 45 days) a tender may take place already in October," they say.
According to “U”, two key requirements for potential participants were maintained in the project, as described in the option that was addressed to the ministries and the FOIVA in July (is "U").
First, there is at least 25 per cent of happiness in the applicant's capital.
The second is the refusal to have access to auctions for foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on investments in strategic societies.
According to the two FZ articles, as "U" was already written on 2 August, the auction may not allow companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent and above) are not FF tax residents or have dual nationality.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, since the Sukhoi Log is related to the federal nerds (more than 50 tons of gold).
The project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies” was confirmed in the mini-naturals but refused to comment on details prior to the Government’s disposal.
The requirement for participation in the capital of the auction participants was raised by the Irkutsk Region, said "U" in Munich in December 2015 and later confirmed the governor of the Sergey Levchenko region, noting that it was sent to Munich by his predecessor Sergey Jerostenko, who had "agreements on investment projects with Rostech".
Anyone who lobbyed the restrictions on the admission of aliens, the U interviewers didn't specify.
"But this is in the spirit of time: not to give control over the largest gold settlement in Russia in the background of Western sanctions," argues the interviewer "U", who is familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The Chief of the Interior, Sergey Donski, stated on 1 August that foreigners “can go to a consortium” if applicants attract them “as a financial structure, technological partners”.
The “U” interviewers consider it unlikely that the government would adjust the conditions.
The main applicant for Suhai Log in the industry is considered a consortium of the largest gold miner of the PAO PAO, the subsidiary son of Suleiman Kerimov Saydu, and Rosteha.
As "U" wrote, in July the partners created S.L.G.S. Gold, where the "Polish" 51%, the "Rosteh" RT-GR 49%.
In Rostehé, the comments were rejected, in Poland, stated "U " that "are certainly interested in this asset " and have all the necessary skills and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the announcement of the conditions," added Paul.
ALROSOA may participate in the auction, but the decision on the Government of the FF said the sources “U”.
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, who were developing assets in Chukotka, said that they could participate in the development of the Dry Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to "U", were not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of gold industry RF Sergei Kashuba estimated U investment in Suhai Log in December 2015 at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants not only detract from the volume of investments but also the complexity of the project: there is a need for a serious survey of the stocks and technology of complex mines, explained by the "U" interviewers in the industry.
In the pension market, the largest M&A transaction -- "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" -- was launched by the merger of four NPFs.
As a result, NPF will be established on the basis of the GasFund Pension Stockpiles of around 373 billion rubles.
Initiating the merger procedure of four pension funds - KIT Finance, Promogrofund, Heritage and Gazfond Pension Stockpiles - the owner of 100% of the KIT Finance Pension Administrator reported yesterday.
“Reorganization is carried out in accordance with the requirements of the existing treaties,” the company reported.
The merger is carried out on the basis of the Guest Fund Pension Stockpiles.
As noted by NPF's manager Oleg Bálošický, the pooling of funds addresses several challenges: increasing the geography of the presence, concentration of resources for development, lowering costs, disseminating best practices for each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
He said that the indicative deadline for completion of consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF, the GasFund Pension Stockpiles will become the largest player in the OPC market.
As of 31 March, the pension stock of the pooled funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As reported on the fund's website, the beneficiaries of its owner's "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" are now Anatolie Gavrilenko (through the control of 65 per cent of the OAS) and the Gazfund NPF (35 per cent).
However, only a group of competitors started much later.
Yes, the O1 NPF sub-control group "Future" swallowed "Stalfund" early this year.
Currently, this combined NPF is joining the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
"Assembly into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to meet the structural challenges," notes NPF "The Future of Nikolai Sidorov.
Active work on the consolidation of funds from April is also under way in the Sofmar Pension Group - the European, Education and Science, and the Region Fund - the Sofmar Pension Group should be involved in the Sofmar NF by the end of the current year.
They will be joined by the NPF Deveria in 2017.
"The pooling of funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operating processes and costs," noted the Sofmar Pension Group.
A break in the pool of funds supported by the “KIT Finance Pension Administrator” may be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, the NPF could not purchase more than 40 per cent of the amount of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively deployed.
Following the amendments to the CB's decision in March of this year, there are no more restrictions on a number of issuers that meet the regulatory requirements.
If necessary, the whole issue can buy up one big game," said Akra's financial institutions' rating group director Yuri Nogin.
Several NPF leaders from top-15 on assets are calling for a further possible reason for a break between the spheres of influence and, as a result, staff appointments in a single fund that should have been agreed upon by the group ' s owners.
Yesterday, Anatolie Gavrilenko was unable to comment.
At the request of "U" in the NPF, "Gasfund" was also not answered.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and low-cost event, it will be justified at a long distance.
As Sergey Okolesnov, Senior Consulting Partner General Sergey Okolesov, says that the Gasfonda Pension Stockpiles are less liquid, accession will allow stabilization of the base of other group funds.
This will call for more successful NPF KIT Finance and Promogrofand experience in the construction of retail ODPs, as well as the use of more modern POs.
The CB's requirements for processes and NPF staff are constantly growing, so it is inappropriate to double the infrastructure on the four funds in a single investment policy, as the managing director of the Corporate Ratings Expert RA, Pavel Mitrofanov.
"The effect of the reduction of duplication would clearly outweigh the possible costs of merger," notes Mr. Mitrofanov.
The cost of pooling four funds, Sergei Okolesnow, is estimated at 30-50 million rubles.
“The cost of maintaining four such funds is approximately 400 million rubles a year, with the consolidation of the medium-term budget actually cutting down twice”, Mr. Okolesnov said.
The best Disney movie "Pit and His Dragon" was in the Russian Prokat.
The beautiful types of New Zealand, the charming dragon, the fascinating story and the country-style song are enough to re-believe ancient magic, according to ELENA CRAWCUN.
The frightened little one improved the dragon, who became a human child and a gentle infant, and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of a box of stories, plays with him in the race and sleeps in the picture.
Six years later, he was left and in a tight - knit relationship, not to distinguish himself from the other purposeful forest raven Maugli.
In this way, Pete and her husband, Bryce Dallas Howard, discovered a red-haired woman, while the Gavin (Karl Urban) brigade, her husband's brother, was aggressively forested.
Now she will have to believe not only in the existence of the dragon but also in helping him to save.
Pete is on an accelerated course of being "human" in the environment of idyllic Americans wearing cowboy shirts, a moral code in the heart and smiling more blindly than in any advertisement.
No person looks or acts too horrible to be hated or feared by the viewer.
Even Gavin, who was hunted down by a notable resident of his own forest, was far away from the uncorrectable villain.
The huge wild dragon also gained no fear, with a good morgue of bulldogs, an aerial range of wings, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon makes fun of it, whispers, even grumbles, and, fortunately, does not say, because he always wants to starve, so it is beneficially different from all the famous cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of holding on to it ensures such a high level of emotional involvement that at the most tense moments, not only small viewers but also adults will cry desperately in three arms.
Amazingly good and young Oaks Figley in the role of Pete, which breaks up between a possible family and the present.
And Robert Redford puts out a canonical grandfather with the pleasure of having literally every child.
How did Director David Laurie manage to take away the fantastically sweet novel of the forgotten Disney movie Dragon Pete in 1977, mediated from nose to tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and play, and make it the most soulful movie this summer?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
In his painting, Laurie from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There were music numbers and most of the weird jokes left behind.
This good story reads the drawings from Bobby, Inoplanetian and many other sweet-hearted children's paintings.
Disney's studio continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality novels in the 21st century.
Of course, Pete and Dragon aren't as charming as the Jungle Book, and it doesn't have an experienced villain that Kate Blanchett has become a cat in the new Zulushke.
But this naive film is no less successful than helping to believe in miracles and good in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to the magic castle The Disney director, Laurie, will get another one for the artistic film adaptation of the story of Peter Penne.
The tandem David Laurie and the scriptist Toby Helbrooks, who worked in Pete and his dragon, entered a new ambitious project on a non-adult boy on James Barry's unique story.
Journalist RBK Aleksandru Sokolova introduces a new indictment
Lawyer Dr. RBK Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the extremist structure, stated that the prosecutor ' s office had found shortcomings in their defence.
That the prosecutor's office made such a presentation, we learned from the investigators yesterday.
We had been scheduled to attend a court meeting on the issue of limiting access to criminal matters, but there was no meeting at all, and the investigators had informed us of the submission made by the Prosecutor's Office," said legal counsel Olga Dinze.
She said that the prosecutor ' s office had instructed investigators to disagree with the qualifications of the case and the collected materials.
The investigators will now have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and submit a new indictment to Alexander Socolov.
Or another article of the Penal Code (UC) will appear in the case, or will remain the same, but with other evidence and new evidence, Ms. Dinze is clarifying.
According to “U”, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation ruled out the accusation by the journalist of the RBC of the formulation of “disastering the political situation towards instability” and “refoulement of the power by illegal means”.
Correspondent "Commersanthoboscosport" ALEXANDR ZILBERT experienced the Olympics in the Olympic Village, inspected the Russian Assembly House, ate at the local table, and even passed the WADA test.
Life doesn't seem to die here for a second.
Even at night.
The last startups are sometimes completed at midnight, after which the athletes need another half an hour or two to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, there is an uninterrupted settlement and eviction from the village, as some athletes finish their speeches and leave Brazil, while others, on the other hand, only arrive here.
By 7:30 a.m., the heads of all the Olympic delegations will be drawn to one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings we usually discuss some operational domestic issues, as the head of the Olympic team of Russia's sports delegation, Igor Kazikov, relates.
It's a hot water problem, so I'm sorry about the uniforms.
We've been fighting for purity for a long time.
At first, no one came out.
Then the clinics came in, but they only sprayed some substance on the floor, yes and everything.
They have sex, do you see any innovations?
Mole, you can't wash them humanly.
Let's know these fields are normal laminate!
In general, changes have been made to the clinning company and now everything is OK.
The Olympic village is South Boutovo, a sleeping area fenced on one side of the mountains, and on the other, an impressive river, a watery area.
Well, there's still a two-metre rail fence across the perimeter, along which the autographers walk.
The entire village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings, a huge Russian flag hangs - this house is completely dedicated to our collection.
Looking at the small lobby at the entrance, you can immediately identify the problems that appear to be the most pressing for the home team.
There are two advertisements on the stand: the printed "Please don't throw paper in the toilet!" and the hand "First in the gift badge.
The stamina itself sinks into the booklets.
Their festive growth contrasts with the headings of the booklets: "Reservation of infectious diseases for those travelling to Rio de Janeiro", "First assistance in melting, inhaling of the international body, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiovascular rehabilitation", "First assistance in fires, heat strokes, fractures and bleedings".
Text inside in a generally encouraging way.
For example: "Infection is accompanied by disease and subsequent treatment.
However, not everyone looks forward to a positive outcome.
Of course, there is a centre in the Russian Assembly that is ready to provide qualified assistance to the residents of the home at any time, including relaxing and sporting massage.
On the contrary, the centre is the headquarters of our delegation.
A row with the door is an inspiring poster "Despite anything, we'll win!"
Well, of course, the verses are:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear will believe in it.
Let us be less, the sweetest taste of victory, Russia won't retreat, won't break!
And for the further enhancement of the Spirit, there is a proclamation: 'Brothers and sisters, the way!
Under the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia Kirilla's spiritual care for the athletes of the Russian Olympic Assembly is carried out by the protoia of Andrei Vladimirovic Alekseyev.
You can order requests and other needs on the phone...
In general, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Obligations for all confessions in the village.
Well, the Russians, they get it, in a privileged position, they have their own watch.
With regard to the cargo of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the ladder, which is recommended to be used during the fire.
And in the darkness he met the bodies on it.
According to all, these were sleeping employees of a new clinning company.
I think at any time they were willing to go to the pool of innovative sexes, they decided to set themselves up for a quiet time right on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with a former acquaintance, Vitalie Fedorovic Dubko, the coach of our Batutists, who brought them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and the educator, European champion Jan Paulov, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
We're living in two beds, of course we're almost on the move, but it's not critical.
Sanzell's one in four, but that's why it's spacious.
Of course, it's funny, from fabric, trust doesn't cause, but something can be done.
"No, you're saying they're out of tea!" said the tennis player Svetlan Kuznetz, whom I met at the main table.
It is primarily called, at least because it is an area of 2.7.000 sq.m. and is ready to accept 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There's 60,000 servings per day free of charge.
The menu options are: "Freaks from Brazil", "Cooks of the World", "Asian Vests" and "Pizes, pasta products".
The last option I saw is that our volleyballists enjoy a lot of popularity.
And let's say I didn't find soup in any of the giant restaurants.
What soup?
It's good that I caught myself a Chinese, a bum.
And a cup of tea.
But in general, to make you understand, we have even worse food on the cards.
There's something you can choose here, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I picked a pair of strawberries and fries in a tomato sauce myself.
Each dish has a table with its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, as well as an indication of the food value of the product and the availability of allergens.
Well, admit it was edible.
I'm not even going to understand why this is always in the local McDonald`s.
Weak, relaxed athletes are expected to say that our best friends, representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), are coming out of the restaurant.
They're subversive to a beaver whose winner is a football player.
They're provocative, you can say!
To receive a gift, at least eight out of ten questions must be answered correctly.
There's questions in Russian! I was attacked by a Wada virgin.
But she didn't attack it.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic break, of course.
The situation has become even worse on the second question: "If I have received notification of the Doping Control, should I go to the Doping Control Point immediately?"
I said, "No, I've got one hour."
He's lost, so to speak, watchfulness.
He forgot that WADA's weak expectations are not coming.
In general, it has to be immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage of Victoria, my situation became totally critical.
I had some reason to think that if I find it difficult to keep a balanced diet because of my fat schedule (and I think it's hard!), I can use bio-additionals to get “additional nutrients to enhance my productivity”.
No, they won't!
More precisely, the answer is that categorically it does not prohibit, but it is imperative, in a number of proposals.
It's not fair. It's WADA!
What's the matter, Russia?
To retreat somewhere behind Ephim, Isinbaeva and all of our unveiled team.
That's why I focused, and I've won an unhappy football.
Know what it says, ours!
In a winning mood, I went to the gym next door.
I'm taking the coach count.
It's 250.
Surprisingly, there was no Russian sportsman in this enormity.
But maybe it's right?
Let him who can't play be trained!
And here's one of our guys sitting in a nearby polyclinic.
To the eyelid.
Don't worry, not a shot.
In a polyclinic, however, like in the whole village, there's a condom machine hanging out everywhere.
And there's an exciting call on him, "You're wearing a condom."
There is still only a round of iron that reminds the handle of the door lock and the condom made from the Amazonian natural latex is ready to come out of the apparatus.
I took one, remember.
The athletes won't make it, they've got 450,000.
For holiday and holiday entertainment in the Olympic Village, there is an entire entertainment centre.
In any case, it has a recognizable table, which reminds us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes.
The center is equipped with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some weird devices like video trainers.
What is this? I'm interested in a Ukrainian company that is actively using a wild game.
Of course, I could just say that you don't want to talk to a man in the form of a Russian assembly, yes.
Here, by some strange faction, it's in the eyes of the guys in the yellow-blue.
The most playing assembly is provided.
It takes at least three hours to walk around the village, looking at every corner of it.
But if you're walking, not riding on electric cars, you're also going to open a house with a Canadian lawn mower at the entrance and a closet with a repair bath, and a ticket office, and a washing machine, and a dry cleaner, and a parking lot, and a flower shop, and a box with everyday consumer goods, and a mail with unique brands (only you can't get rid of the Chinese philatelists), and a bank, and a search office, and a photocosque.
And in the late evening, you'll be sitting next to an olive tree that's lined up with colorful tapestry in the memory of those who left the world with friends and relatives of athletes.
And you're going to be under the accompaniment of a machine that undisputedly scatters fluid to kill insects, thinking about forever.
It's about the Olympic movement.
Which doesn't stop in this village for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was hiding their breath, watching as the Australians had not been sent to the American Dream Team, these patients went online.
Little one knows: The news that Inna Deriglasza won gold in the rapper at the XXXI Olympics, I got the first.
Maybe I'm the only mosquito that's ever seen it happen, not considering those who were watching the Carioca competition that night.
This can only be understood by the present patient.
Here's a deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors down - as always before nighttime - fall apart and begin to cry out unhappily, but it is very loud to yell at each other.
And threatening to drive the furniture.
There's no time to go to the market and buy as the plumber asked.
There's nothing in the TV schedule, so he was just in control of the Match, the First, and in any case, Russia, although it's almost pointless.
"Russia" is a family of times, all the sports there for some reason in the records.
There's a live air show broadcast.
Hope, of course, at Match, a young man screamed all night in news releases first about the great semifinal Deriglasa-Shanaeva, then about the upcoming gold fight.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is U.S. Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about that.
The Australians were equal, the first half won at all.
They put in place officers of their own size.
As a result, they have lost, but as they say now, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be an old one.
It's all right, but it's getting close to the fight with Dee Francis, but on the screen with no change.
In an easy panic, I'm starting to write down channels.
That's the feeling, the second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep down on the cables.
There's no "Matthew" on any of the subjects.
And, in my opinion, the fight will begin.
The text and tweets of some sports sites don't set me up.
The surrogate serfing produces an unexpected but brilliant result.
The "First" website provides a direct technical transmission of all the competitions that are currently taking place.
I'm clicking on fat, I'm getting a unit for gold.
Deriglas are well-contracted, go forward in the eye - and clearly begins to take the time.
The Italian plays almost all the breaks.
Our one point forward, to the end hear more than two seconds.
De Francesca is thrown into Deriglas, and retreats, the time is over, and the Italian is making a move.
Victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic messenger on the phone reported the fourth gold medal.
I'm the first one to see it with his eyes.
The foolish, the faithful, the deserving.
Tatarstan's spiritual management of Muslims (DUM) refuses to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the prisoner of the DUM committed his possessions to preaching Friday only in Tatar to force young Tatars to "student their native language".
The board states that it is "in no case prejudices" the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani believes that the Tatar language does not understand up to 60 per cent of foreigners, including foreign students, migrants and tatars themselves.
We are afraid that their sermons in the tatar "will not reach the whole audience."
Yesterday, the DUM Tatarstan prisoner unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic only in the Tatar language.
As Tatarstan's Mufti Kamil Samigulin said, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "student their native language".
"For those who say "weight", in each large mosque we intend to organize the teaching of tatar language absolutely free," said Mr. Samigulin.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force” and today in all mosques the sermons “must be in Tatar language”.
He recalled that DUM Tatarstan is publishing the magazine Shura with typical Tatar sermons.
I've got something that doesn't say well enough, "it can be basically prepared."
DUM Tatarstan brings together more than a thousand incomes in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to Muftia, Friday’s sermons are conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, Russian was used mainly in some mosques in Kazani.
In particular, as Mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev mosque, Zakabana and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed, the leadership called for all students to have both State languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"No harm can be done to a Muslim netizen," stressed Mr. Muhammad, explaining that the preaching itself "is not an obligatory, fundamental part of the framing."
In doing so, Namas will continue to read in Arabic, lessons and lessons in Russian will remain in the mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said "U," that there was no serious threat of getting Tatar language out of the mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar languages, such as Uzbek or Tadjik, it is reported that the sermons in the Republic are not used.
DUM's decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatar (WCT).
The head of the WCT Colonel Rinat Zakirov said "U" "Mecheti is an important part of our national life".
It would be sad if the Tatar language had left this area.
He noted that preaching in the Tatar language was only “the desire of the possessives”, but in the WCT's statement, it was “considered to be correct”.
The "U" surveyed have spoken in Russian and are willing to comply with the DUM decision, but they believe that there will be difficulties with the understanding of the clergy.
There are tatars and Russians in the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course they'll be sad.
"It has to be rebuilt," says I have the Burnaev mosque of Farhat Mawletdinov.
According to him, preaching in Russian is closer even to many Tatars, because “Russian and in schools and in kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere originally.”
However, he believed that the Mass could continue lessons and lectures in the Russian language, which were held on other days.
We put our trust in Allah.
God will bring about the end of this state of affairs."
But about 60% of us don't know Tatar.
It's both Uzbek and Tadjik and Azerbaijani.
There are many foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been in Russian for four years," says I.
He believes that the sermons in Tatar will “come to a tighter circle and not come to the whole audience”.
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
It's just the result of the sermons.
But time will show.
"For example, it'll only be easier for me, because the Tatar language is my native language," concluded Gabdulla Galliulin.
Former Director of the FSIN
The Moscow Procurator ' s Office has passed an indictment on the criminal case concerning the theft of the budget allocated to FSIN Russia.
A former head of the prison department, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, who had caused FSIN damage to more than 2.7 billion rubles, will appear before the court.
The Central Prosecutor ' s Office has sent a criminal case to the Zamoskovorice court with respect to former director FSIN of Russia, Alexander Reimer, his former deputy Nikolai Krivolapova, as well as the director of the GSP Information and Technology Services Centre of the Federal Criminal Enforcement Service (CITOS).
Depending on the role and extent of participation in the commission of the crimes, they are accused of the CSF in Moscow by section 3, 285 of the FMR (infringement by officials with severe consequences), section 4, 159 of the FMR (a fraud committed using its official status as an organized group, particularly large).
In addition, Krivolapov is accused under article 1, section 222 of the RF (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR version, in 2010-2012, the persons identified by fraud kidnapped the budget allocated by FSIIN to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems of the sub-controllers, called electronic bracelet.
In order to steal the budget money, the group developed a scheme whereby its subsidiary CITOS FPF, which had concluded the relevant public contracts, produced control and oversight techniques, including electronic braceletes, and implemented several times higher prices.
Although CITOS had no production equipment, buildings, facilities for the deployment of production capacities to create a completed cycle of production of electronic braceletes, five Russian-owned pipelines were completed between them and FSIN Russia, of more than 3.3 billion rubles.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles have been stolen from the Samara branch of the FPU, of which 1.2 billion rubles have been stolen.
According to the investigation, over 140 million of the funds recovered were personally received by Mr. Reymer in his office from one of the partners in respect of whom a criminal case had been handed down in separate proceedings.
Nikolai Krivolapova, who participated in the machinations, found an unknown origin of the patron to the award gun, allowing him to be charged with further charges.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, a claim of 2.7 billion rubles was made by FSIN to the accused.
Soccerist Hakan Suquor is suspected of taking part in the pike.
The Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for a former footballer and then a member of the Hakan Sukura Parliament and searched his family's two houses.
The Turkish football star of the 1990s - the early 2000s of the attack by Hakan Sukuur is being searched by the country ' s authorities for a coup attempt last month.
Forvard, who completed his sports career in 2008, was accused of belonging to “an armed terrorist group”.
This is the Hizmet movement, a society associated with a well-known Turkish religious figure and opposition to Fethulla Gulen.
It was his President Erdogan who was the organizer of the military coup on 15 July.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, a warrant was issued today for the arrest of Hakan Shuquur, and the police have already conducted searches in two homes belonging to the family of the former footballer.
According to the investigation, Fethullah Gulen joined his father in addition to Hakan Shuquur himself.
However, neither the former footballer nor his close friends proved to be there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
In his home, he protected the colours of several Turkish clubs and spoke for the assembly country.
He spent most of his career at Galatasarae.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as English "Blackburn".
True, he did not spend more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukuur is still the most effective attacker of Turkey's assembly: in his assets, 112 matches for the national team and 51 bullets killed.
In 2013, Hakan Shukuur left his post as a deputy because of an initial corruption investigation around the Erdogan party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, an arrest warrant for at least 42 journalists was issued in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of promoting military conversion and the links with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
In view of the severity of the charges, media staff can wait for a long prison term from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovski wants to create a film theater network only for home movies.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for the Russian cinema, which was 2-3 times smaller than for foreign production," he said.
Mr. Konchalovski noted that Russian films were difficult to compete for the audience with large Hollywood bands.
We have over 100 paintings in our country every year, with an average of 20-25 tapes.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with the Transformers and the Iron Man, in which there are huge budgets," said the film director.
Remember, on 1 July, the All-Russian Youth Education Forum "Tavrida" began working in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals from different creative and humanitarian backgrounds from all over Russia and from a number of countries in neighbouring and remote countries.

Former Deputy Governor Nikolai Sandakova Konstantin Akulic was detained in Miasse (Chelabean Region).
According to U-South Ural, another accused lawyer, Sergei Kolosovski, Constantina Akulic, today called into the investigation department of the MISS SCR to file an annual case of assault.
Konstantin Akulic then went to the DTP as a lawyer to assist one of his participants.
"It was originally set up against unidentified people, and now that he started protecting Nikolai Sandaków, it turned out to be Akulic," says Sergei Kolosovski.
Constantine Akulic became a former deputy governor's lawyer in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the call of a lawyer in the MIASS SCR, the defence party was informed that Monday was due to be informed of the material of the fraud case in which Nikolai Sandakova was accused.

The Russian Honey Company (RMC) is prepared to take on social responsibility and to pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMK has been considered to modernize one of the country's oldest and most environmentally “bad” enterprises, the Carabas med fleet.
The Karabish Medeship was founded by an English stocking company headed by Leslie Urkwart in 1910.
In Soviet times, this was important to the country ' s economy, and it actually ensured the vitality of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, production was halted due to financial problems, resulting in serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, a decision was taken to resume the work of the Caribbean med fleet.
It was also necessary to address one of the major environmental problems of the Caribbean.
By the early 2000s, Karabash had been known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation in Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company was run by the Russian Honey Company.
The company began to modernize production, gradually reducing environmental pressures on the environment.
This was recently noted by the Governor of the Caribbean area, Boris Dubrovski, who visited the first issue of July, Karabashmede.
The head of the South Ural called the major changes that have occurred with the company since Karabashmede moved to the RMK group.
The main event for the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sero-sero-sero-stolen seal to capture up to 99.9 per cent of the metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Honey Company, the amount of investment in the project was about 7 billion rubles.
The next phase of the modernization of the Karabashmede ZAO is the reconstruction of the convertible.
The replacement of three converters, vacuum cleaners, the gas tract is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016 it is planned to launch a new one-billion rubble cleaning of industrial goods.
In turn, the amounts of taxes allocated to the city's budget will be increased.
During the entire period of implementation of the Tominsk HOC project, from the start of construction and before the second round, the federal penalty will be 8.9 billion rubles.
After the introduction of the GCC, the revenue from all levels of the budget may amount to 80.9 billion rubles.
For the year of production in the Varnen region, there were 346.3 million rubles in budgets at various levels.
And this is the first year.
"The more successful the company is, the more it can be," added Valerie Ulanovski.
In the RMK, it was clarified that in 2015 the tax deductions from the Miheev HOC approached 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of SMEs in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax deductions.
RMK companies are helping to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and entertainment facilities, and to foster territory.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Honey Company in Karabash has become a capital repair, and in fact, almost complete restructuring of the N9 child care facility to 95 educators.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency condition.
Also on the territory of RMK Arenas are a landscape park with artificial powder, underground and underground parking for 600 machines, coffee and sports shops.
The RMK Arena will allow the conduct of mature professional sports activities at the international level.
But the main objective of this project is to make exercise in physics and sport in comfortable conditions accessible to the inhabitants of Chelabinsk, especially for children.

The Montenegrin Navy has undertaken a decommissioning of anti-water protection measures in the Black Sea aquarium.
The RIA Novosti reported on this by a representative of the Mino Defence Press Office on the Igorj Digalo Marine Fleet.
Training was carried out in the first phase of the special activities of the WFP forces.
“The anti-water-diversification units have deployed a anti-water-diversity defense at the base of the fleet at the shore and adjacent Black Sea aquarium,” Digalo said.
About 400 military personnel, more than 10 military units, including Mi-8 and Ka-27 helicopters, anti-diversity Cats of Grachonok and Reptor, participated in the studies.
During the maneuvers of the fuelled ships using hydroacoustic means, conditional diversion groups were detected and the attack by the sea on the CF force base was reflected.
From the Ka-27 helicopter, a desantno-sturmous group was deployed, which blocked and destroyed the dispersants of a conditional opponent.

WSJ: The United States is considering sanctions against RF due to the breakdown of democratic servers.
Officials of the United States are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the invasion of the Democratic Party servers, writes The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, it is reported that the U.S. President Barack Obama's administration will be officially accused of assaulting Russian servers or backed by Russian hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other American services are almost convinced of Russia ' s involvement in cyberattack.
WSJ notes that the United States usually prefers not to mention specifically those who engage in hacker attacks.
The exception is the acquisition in 2014 of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, which was officially responsible for the CDR.
Last year, however, Obama issued an order facilitating the imposition of sanctions on those who implement or promote cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be long, the publication writes.
Even if officials found that the hackers had acted with the support of Russia, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose information.
They have to determine whether such a serious incident is likely to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
It was previously reported that the Barack Obama administration was allowing sanctions against a State whose hackers had been hacked into by servers of the Democratic Party.
WikiLeaks has published an electronic list of the National Democratic Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the burglary.
In Kremlin, such messages were called absurd.
FAS punished Google almost half a billion rubles
There was a distortion of competition in the mobile app market.
The antitrust procedure was initiated on the Yandex initiative.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphones with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited applications from other developers, in particular from "Jandex".
FAS found confirmation of these claims and found that the company had abused the dominant position on the market and imposed on mobile devices manufacturers the installation together with the Google Play store of other applications.
As a result of the verification, the Federal Antitrust Service decided to punish Google, informed FAS Manager Alexei Dozenko.
The fine shall be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
In FAS it was concluded that the competition protection law should be observed by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to study the decision first and only then to define further actions: to implement it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antitrust Service recognized the company as a competitor in September of last year and ordered that contracts be adjusted until 18 December.
However, Google did not agree.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting judicial proceedings.
In FAS, it was noted that despite the fine, they were discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a world agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This was the opinion of Ehu Moscow, a leading researcher in the Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would not affect the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

The Anime effect Snapchat criticises as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some viewers say it is racially insensitive.
With the help of the Linza Snapchat tool, approximately 150 million users are allowed to change the reality and play with individuality in ways that limit the absurdity.
You can turn yourself into ananas, a dog or a character to stand up to the painting of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are rough, distorting lines of instruments that create more than 30 million adjusted self - esteems a day.
Any mistakes quickly become public.
The Snapchat Lenses were criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of the person or encouraged the whited persons as ideal for beauty.
So when some users this week were offered a lens that gave them hairy eyes, curved teeth, and horny dogs, some critics considered it racist cartoonism on Asians as "yellow".
And they asked whether these repeated contradictions to the more serious problem of a company related to diversity were indicated.
On Wednesday, reports on The Verge and Motherboard were distributed, and the following day after Snapchat stated that they had removed this function.
The company commented: The lens was designed as respect for anime characters, not as Asian cartoons.
But experts who know about racism are not aware of it, the lens has been reminded of the oppressive stereotypes in effect.
Others completely rejected the comparison with anime.
In an e-mail, Grace Spapani, a Korean-American art student, who was actively involved in photography, said that the lens was “suffering and at least uncomfortable”.
She added that "it was hard to argue about the side of a very rough caricature on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowing, it's a highly destructive yellowing.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
The American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, starting from the corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the ladies we all carry.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat, who are more racially diverse than their older generation, can mean that they are more likely to expect understanding.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that's insulting to the user, then she said in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Ju, "it's so much harder to stay undetected as it was before."
On Thursday, Ju, the product manager and the engineer working on the Medium, decided to remove his account in Snapchat and urged others to do the same.
In the article for Medium and in the telephone interview, she said that racial contradictions were due to insufficient diversity in the recruitment of staff in Snepchate.
Already criticised mainly the white management of a man-only company and ended her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Xu, who himself is an American of Chinese origin, wrote: "If they did not have enough people in the state who could make such decisions, or have people who are blind, they did not have a position which is safe and transparent."
Other observers shared her view by expressing discontent that Snapchat had not answered most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but according to a trusted person, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on insufficiently represented populations and on active efforts to involve domestic resources.
For her part, Ju said she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can say they won't go."
Military leadership has broken down IGIL intelligence, reports Congressional Commission
The officers of the United States Central Armed Forces had modified the reconnaissance reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the ground for the on-the-spot developments, the congressional commission reported in a report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Presidents of the Committee of the Chamber of Representatives of the House of Representatives of the COP, the Committee on Intelligence and the Sub-Committee on Military Appropriations found “widespread discontent” among analysts of the Central Command Intelligence Service, who claimed that the leaders had undermined their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
The central command, known as Centcom, is the main military management in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The research documents confirmed by the Centcom High Command generally gave a more optimistic picture of U.S. counter-terrorism actions, as confirmed by real data from the scene, and were stablely more optimistic than the analysis provided by other specialist services,” said the report.
"What happened in Centkom is unacceptable: when the top management seems uncertain, our military suffers," said a member of the House of Representatives of Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The problems of leadership in Centcom reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report provides a detailed understanding of the shortcomings that have constantly occurred in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training Iraq ' s armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain definitive evidence that Obama ' s management has been ordered to falsify the reports, he claims that analysts felt that Centkom ' s management forced them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as IGIL or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies of the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than actual events”, the report reported.
For example, Officer Centkoma publicly stated that the major military attack aimed at Mosul's return could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is probably known," said a member of the House of Representatives Mike Pompeo, a Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence officer in the U.S. Central Command has provided command intelligence to reduce the threat from IGIL in Iraq.
The Republicans set up an operational group when they learned that the analysts were concerned that the Islamic State was being investigated had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report, published on Thursday, will follow up more disaggregated data.
An additional, uncompleted investigation carried out by Centkoma is conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the Committee on the Exploration of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican operational group.
" Between 2014 and 2015, Centkom has established an over-closed intelligence assessment procedure for IGIL and Iraq's security forces," said a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Shiff, the lead representative of the Democratic Party of the Committee.
According to Shifa, this procedure “stopped the issuance of intelligence documents”, damaged the moral status of analysts and “depressed the growing views”.
But Shiff and the Democrats claim that there was no evidence that the White House was trying to force the analysts of Centkom to bring their conclusions under the “response or political interpretation”.
Preliminary results of the Congress' investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of Pentagon, which was opened after the complaints by the analysts of Centcom.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress until the investigation of the Chief Inspector continued.
But he said that “experts sometimes have an opinion on integrated data processing, and the services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues relating to national security”.
The consequences of the investigation are beyond the scope of whether US-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is achieved (as the Ministry of Defence is now increasingly claiming).
But last year's statements cause doubt as to whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of the Islamic State repeats the disputes that took place more than ten years ago when an intelligence analyst by St. Gregory Hucker wrote a research article that claimed that the administration of President George Walker Bush, as a result of the protests of many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not consider what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Huker also played a key role in the protest caused by the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, the Huker team concluded that despite public declarations of return, aircraft from Islamic State-owned oil factories did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil pipelines to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not spread outside the Central Command, as reported in the Times newspaper in September.
The then Commander of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony at the Senate, which many MPs considered to be overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.
The United States has won four rounds of women ' s hockey in grass, thus drawing closer to the crucial understanding with Britain.
Killing once three goals in a match that ended the victory over Japan with an account 6-1, Katie Bem opened the account on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's hockey team on the grass when the Americans won the win over the India team with an account 3-0.
Five heads in two games must be a memorable achievement, but Bem, 27 years old, says she's not sure she would ever do anything like that.
"You're not an app," she said.
I'm really not one of those people who follow their goals.
This is what she knows: American 4-0s in the Olympics, and they are meeting for the first place in their team with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan's 2-0s win on Thursday.
The British and U.S. teams will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams claim a quarter final, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their team of six teams and who will take the second.
The winner will avoid meetings with a strong team of opponents from the Netherlands, the leaders of another group, a bit of weather when the fourth-finals games begin.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made the noise of their unexpected series four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in London.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time took a pot for hockey on grass when she was 3 (the oldest twins played this kind of sport in Drexel) and joined the National Assembly at the age of 16 and became her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she did not take her turn to the finals.
Then, in 2012, she and her teammate didn't make it all up.
The following year, Koyg Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed a coach, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, physical training change," said Bem.
We didn't have the productivity in London that we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bem opened the account in the first half of the game with an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India has come to play without a single victory in the tournament, but the team has shown themselves to be surprised and has kept account 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bem took the initiative.
She made a long walk with a ball down the left side of the field, then the spiral went into the middle and she pushed the ball straight into the door, thus giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The dry win was the first one on a U.S. door trip to Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
So is Bem.
"We are in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how well it depends on the result of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the Olympics - "Day" battalions
Wherever you are, any time now, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro appear to be unchanging and inevitable, a combination of competition and ambition.
It's an Olympic fire, and there's that hot façade that goes from the sink to the sailor, to the gymnast, to the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper or listen to your neighbors' conversation in a coffee order and not hear about Simone Bails, Katie Ledecki or about the enmity between Michael Felps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Duli.
Duli, for the first time involved in the Olympic Games, a beautician with eggs on her cheeks, could be among the celebrities shown in the premieres promoted by sponsors and vital advertising roles if he was a sailor, gymnast or even a festive.
But 28-year-old Dolly from Lake Forest in California is fighting for gold in the Olympic Battalion.
The Olympics don't highlight all the same events.
Far from the center, in part in the shadows, there are sports that are not widely recognized: shooting from a pneumatic gun, shooting from a bow, vasminton, tekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long time for him to reign.
But if I'm allowed to speak for my personal passion, let me draw your attention to the modest pledge of the boots on the boat.
Although battalions have been an Olympic type of sport since 2000, when they competed in the games in Sydney, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many of the people I have been interrogated have not been aware that they are generally related to the Olympics.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to competitions, they have never won medals at the boot and their athletes have not been in the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians usually share male awards, while the Chinese and Canadians are women.
Dun Dun from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But the battalions have an outdoor charm, especially because for an uneducated ear they are more associated with a circus college than with the Olympics.
Here I must admit that I am not an expert, but just a ground-based enthusiasm.
In fact, they have comedy potential — a caricature of endless bunnies — but also the beauty of gymnastics and bunnies in water, two kinds of sports that they mainly combine.
The word "batt" comes from the Spanish word "el trampoline", which means "trample for springs in the water."
Applicants for victory are drawn on a giant boat, flying almost 30 feet away, and must perform acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and salt) before the final landing.
They are evaluated for performance, complexity and “flight times”, according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will meet in Rio.
The most popular Olympic course is ahead.
Medal applicants must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth in the field.
They seek not only the final drawing or the starting wall, but also, as seen by the camera, the other driving edge: the world record or the Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, worthy of admiration, even fanatical — and it is enough to make even the sight pass.
But it, in my opinion, gets a little tired when you watch the Games.
He's got his boots on the boat.
The drummer's direction is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, seems like an astronaut flying up, then down, then no effort up again.
And of course they don't have any competition or difficulty, but there's no crazy passion for finish throughout the program, there's no shorts in length, just a strange, obvious disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the closest to today's Olympic sport.
Women ' s qualification competitions, and then the finals will be held on Friday, during the day on Eastern European times; men on Saturday, also on Saturday.
NBC will broadcast the finals within the agenda from 14:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
In the course of the Olympic Games, there is a peaceful, beautiful moment that can be easily seen in the general trash.
And if awareness can only be achieved by men's sportsmen who are guided by views and objectivization -- as Wall Street Journal said recently, men's gymnasts from the United States -- Duli is just waiting for her new amazing crowd of fans.
"Generation protests" in Ethiopia, a former ally of the United States
Angrily protested in Ethiopia
The demonstrators requiring political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the Government.
The eyewitnesses say that dozens of protestors were killed during the clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the brink of collapse?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly developing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-governmental protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
Only in the last week did thousands of people get out of the street, requiring radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s response was harsh.
The eyewitnesses claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
The video footage from the protest sites reportedly taken at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year shows how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands on the wall.
The United Nations High Representative for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in the international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is maintained by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably — there is even a new suburban train in Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, was hardly a model of democracy — human rights organizations constantly referred to governmental repression - the opposition in the territory of the State was interrupted by the fact that dissidents were forced to shut up.
Many of them were incarcerated, imprisoned, killed or expelled in remote deserts.
But it can change.
"If people are constantly pushing and leaving options other than protesting, the uprising will rise," said Seium Teshome, a lecturer at the University in central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
The generation protests.
The complaints are numerous, starting from land use, ending with the Government Coalition.
Following the widely criticised elections last year, the Government party and its allies have been fully opposed and are now controlling 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tension along the border with Eritrea is growing; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border has led to hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use riots and rearm themselves.
A number of factors explain why the bitter feelings that have been in the depths of the soul for several years are now rising.
First, it would seem totally harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become popular and internet services have improved.
Even when the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was the way they were organized for protests.
Secondly, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhar, two of the largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhar from the predominantly Christian high mountain regions of Ethiopia has flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of which are Muslims and live in low areas.
But it also changes.
"We will act together at one start," said Mulat Hamechu, leader of Oromo.
The major protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromo.
Many of Amharia and Oromo feel that in Ethiopia they are unfairly dominated by the members of the Tigris ethnic group, which is about 6 per cent of the population, which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, the former rebel leader, has served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have predicted danger.
Analysts claim that he had particularly experienced the first signs of discontent and used investigators to obtain data and dissipate opponents.
"The current regime doesn't make much sense," said Abdi, an analyst for conflict situations.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Heilemariam Desalen, appeared in nowhere and took over Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was born from the Tigris region in northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam south.
Analysts say it does not use the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that this will lead to even more bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia had experienced such concerns in 2005, after thousands of people had protested against the fact that, as analysts have said, it was likely the elections that the Government had called for and then had the results.
During subsequent repressions, many Protestants were killed, although in less than the last few months, and this period of riots was relatively rapid.
The development experts expressed appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for the long-term development of infrastructure, such as the new intergovernmental train and significant success in combating poverty.
Obviously, however, this did not stop the increase in domestic discontent by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Honduras, the city of Amhar, attacked businesses belonging to the Tigers, and anti-Third hatred on social networks became comprehensive.
Analysts claim that the Protestants are making the United States and other Western allies uncomfortable.
The US Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it had recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose its power in an already unstable region.
"And it's gonna be hard to get through this stuffed cannon," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that IGIL was founded by Obama, "sarcast"
Donald J. Tramp tried to replace the last conflict that had taken over his pre-election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when several times this week said President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State's terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions regarding the ability of the candidate to act as president of the Republican Party to address the American people with due regard.
It also set up his successors, who tried to protect him during a period of trouble, in an awkward situation because they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Expressing this assumption on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his statement on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton had founded IGIL.
But in a post on Twitter early in the morning, on Friday, Trump wrote that he was just equinoxing.
This post was a direct contradiction to the claim made only earlier on the day when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his indictment.
When radio-conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his speech, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy IGIL, the candidate for the presidency of the Republican Party did not take the opportunity.
The last scandal was when Trump tried to reorient his campaign to the economy in the face of a decline in the rating.
Trump and Clinton made a competitive speech about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried again to return to this topic.
Once again he turned to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to an increase in taxes, and he said it was boring.
Trump used sarcasm as a excuse before.
At the end of July, after he came across a general criticism, almost expressing the idea that the Russian should break Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments, saying, "At last, I'm joking."
Such an approach allows Trump to go beyond what is acceptable in political terms and to take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing some of the messages that are responding to his worshipers to see how they work and then "explain" them on the other side, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, an expert on communication, who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's cautious in his statements and knows that they're sloppy enough to treat them differently.
Instead of making excuses for the large election, Trump has taken an even more sensitive tone in recent days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that the tramp is leaving Clinton with a large shift in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and is going to Florida.
Although Trump is usually trying not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and not understanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has been the focus of the presidential campaign in recent months, his jokes have put his faithful allies in an awkward position: they must publicly support him regardless of his provocation.
Rudolf U. Juliani, former mayor of New York, who was one of the most famous Deputy Tramps, made serious efforts to protect the candidate in the interview with the CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he is saying is an acceptable political comment," said Juliani when he was asked about the credibility of the Tramp's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That is true in the sense that before Obama IGIL was almost unknown to a small organization, he called it a non-violent threat, totally unjust, and that is why everything happened because he had taken an army out of Iraq.
Most of the medieval republicans are convinced that the Obama administration, in which Clinton held the position of State Secretary, has allowed IGIL to develop because it was unable to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for every word he said and foresight.
He stared at the "poor unfortunate" television experts who were trying to talk about him, and he said, "They're weak!"
Some of the Democrats have ridiculed Trump's excuses as a further confirmation that it is not appropriate for the Presidents to do so.
Sometimes the dehydrated coffee goes back to Greenpoint.
The "Verb" coffee shop was covered with only cash in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi but had been a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was taken out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
Soup Sherry, which took place in Werb in the summer of 2014, is selling soap in the form of cookies.
Locals complained about her as the last loss in the refreshing city.
The artist Molly Krabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a charity store."
But while New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
Verb's reborn coffee opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
In the new Verbe there is Wi-Fi and credit cards, but there are some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere.
Besides, coffee's still good.
The new "Verba" is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, an old coffeemaker who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there by the end of the day.
When one of the clients offered to propose him in a new place, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, 36 years old, left a lot in the past.
Werb works with the same bike distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It's even got mirrors from the old Verba.
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He proposed new candles.
The menu features bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches and is available from caps or hot oak.
There's a puddle of a stormy breed.
Coffee is no longer served as beer, but freshly cooked juices are now being prepared.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he had turned his attention to the constant flow of old permanent customers.
"Many of the former customers have also issued prices from Williamsberg," he said.
In one recent resurrection, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliver, who was 34 years old, lived in Williamsberg and often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that pushed me into Verbe," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although on that day instead of the usual ice-coffee she ordered a cup of tea, another newspaper.
Tom Rosenthal, another former client, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same.
"In fifteen minutes of the eighth, every day, as in hours, I came and prepared my run for me with butter and all manners," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduce new wires into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal is still making an ordinary order, but sometimes he's changing something with a bacon, egg or cheese on the beige in all ways.
Rodriguez said he was not offended that the store had once taken over the old place.
In addition, the owners of Soup Sheri offered to make special soap for Verba, using coffee made from coffee made in a cold way as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree with their proposal," said Rodriguez.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved the coffee.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the window so that his new neighbors would feel desired.
There are other benefits in the new place.
The local point for the sale of juices is intended to pour into bottles and sell coffee made in a cold way.
There is a likelihood that the caffeine will join the next building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new Verb will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent client, and he shared that he was killed when they closed.
When the coffee opened in a new place, Witt said that when he came in and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he was coming home.
"How long I've wanted to feel this aroma," he admitted.
Depressive food of depression in the "Float Table"
In March 1933, shortly after the rise of the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt settled to dinner at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved the fashion fairies of the Fifth Avenue, such as the Fua-gra and the Myrland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: fried eggs in tomato sauce, potato powder, and dessert pudding from black.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband, Andrew Cou, added, "This was also the message for Americans about how to eat."
The wives living in Brooklyn Heights are food history experts.
The last book of Coua, "The Chinese Rago", was about the Chinese cuisine in America, and Zigelman told the story of life in a lonely apartment in the Lower East Side through food in his book "House 97 on the Street Fruit Garden".
Their new joint work on "Float Table", which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
In some way their own culinary solidarity met with the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small breakfast parlor in the Fletiron district, which has been working since 1929, the year of Birže’s collapse.
Zigelman, 54, ordered a sleek cheese and butterboard with pieces of olives, and Cou, 57, took an Indian, potato powder, and a fruit mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roulette, the couple considered this appropriate starting point for the discussion of food in the days of depression.
"The roulettes used a lot of demand," said Zigelman.
There was an Arachis roulette, a peacock roulette, a bean roulette.
They were made from basic ingredients and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to grow.
Imagine eating as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Kou's tired.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Women ' s groups prepared for farm workers and freshly baked pie for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who fed hungry Europeans during the First World War that described how the country managed to stop being a country of abundance.
"That was the time when food became a central, unprovoked theme for Americans," said Kou, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget line was not easy: mystery wires, such as rollers and pancakes, became the main food products; the pancake was "a wonderful way to make meals useful," Zigelman observed, because the poultice could hide unsatisfied ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, the former basis of American food for many years, has become economically distributed.
People have experimented with strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary health.
By doing research for a book that includes recipes, Zigelman prepared the veil of that era: a baked oak, made of arachic oil.
"This addition to the lunch table was not successful," Cou said.
Zigelman added, "That was very strange."
Arachis oil does not fit perfectly into the hot arc.
This was typical of many household recipes.
More than ever since, home - care professionals — including Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Home - care office from 1923 to 1943 — have managed the country’s food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “budgeters”, to accept challenges, and to turn the beard into a scattered spaghetti with a carrot into a delicious dish.
"Frequent dining" is the pride of curious historical facts.
The Government's reaction to starving citizens, for example, is particularly marked by the position of President Herbert Guverra in the spirit of “let the pies eat”.
Publicly carrying the simple farm strip of the state of Iowa during his childhood, he was fed as a refined millionaire who became.
"He liked the continental cuisine, for example, fish with soup sauce," said Cou.
He was practically in a golden table, hoping for a tuxedo.
He was fantastically distracted from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to give an example to his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economy that was completely uninterested in taste, and this led to the White House "to use not only the most unsatisfied food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared."
Many of the culinary receptions of the era of depression were forgotten as soon as the country was back on its feet.
Their heritage is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Zigelman, and how science has been used to prepare food.
The wives tell us that during writing the book, they better understand the eating habits of Zegelman’s mother — that she could not expel food, for example.
"She was really afraid of a careless attitude towards food," Cou said.
Zigelman remembers, "She poisoned people in a full series."
There was one unpleasant case with the phytrols.
When the tarels in Eisenberg's left, they got a dessert with Cou that they prepared at home: a dessert from the black which President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a black muss," said Zigelman, adding that it was a common welcome to give modest recipes the Brosé names.
Swallowed sheets were not only blackish, a bit of pain, sugar, water, and cover.
Everyone was reluctant to put the bed in a narrow, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was good.
Kou asked for extras twice.
With the voice of a trusted budget writer, he said to the woman: "A small rumbled Greek eagle would not be in trouble here."
The arrest of the figures for mass Drac in Havana Palace was extended until 14 November
By 14 November, the Presnej court had left the media dragon case under arrest in Havana Bay, satisfying the relevant request for investigation.
There are 14 persons in the case as accused.
Recall that on 14 May, there was a massive killing of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus using weapons, resulting in the deaths of three people.
Former head of Yuri Chabuev and lawyer, founder of the public health nation organization, Alexander Bocharnik, was charged with murder.
The question of the second year of 2016 pension indexation can be resolved within the next two or three weeks.
On 12 August, the Vice-President of the Government of RF, Olga Golodec, reported this during a visit to the Brian region.
We have specific options to increase our pension so as to reinvigorate the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Economists are now undermining the mid-year, and we will finish this work in the next two or three weeks," says the Hunger of Interface.
Commenting on the proposed strategic development plan by the Centre for Strategic Development by Alexei Kudrin, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the theme was not discussed in the cabin.
At the end of July, it was known that the Government had agreed on the position on the full pension payment index in 2017.
Stone and Grigoryan went to the finals of the shooting of a small-calibre rifle.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamenski and Kirill Grigoriyan were in the final match for a small-calibre rifle from the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergey Kamensky took 629 balls and took the first place -- this is a new Olympic record in qualification.
Cyril Grigorian became the second - 628.9 were.
Eight best athletes have gone to the final.
The Stone is a world recordman in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition Pethullah Gulen requires an international investigation into the circumstances of a coup attempt in Turkey.
"I require the independent international commission to investigate the attempts to convert the State," says the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition also said that "if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey".
However, Gulen strongly denied participation in the hospital, stressing that his organization had never claimed political authority.
The Istanbul Court had before him arrested opposition Islamic preacher Fethhullah Gulen.
Remember, the attempt to convert the military took place in Turkey on the night of 15-16 July.
Gilead companies reimburse the costs of law enforcement during a patent dispute with Merck
The company Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to receive reimbursement for the costs of legal services it has incurred in connection with the issue of a hepatitis C patent with Merck & Co Inc manufacturer, a federal district judge.
In June, Gilead was released from payment of $200 million in damages for the violation of two Merck patents related to Gilead medicines, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including a lie under oath and other non-ethical proceedings.
At the trial on Thursday, a judge of the U.S. Federal District Court, Beth Lebson Freeman, said that Gilead had the right to reimbursement of the costs incurred in the dispute.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 per cent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013 when Gilead and Merck brought each other to trial, asserting their rights to laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, an active ingredient in Gilead medicine.
Armed forces established with the support of the United States claim to have taken full control of Manbij in the Islamic State
The armed forces established with the support of the United States took full control of the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining in the city of the Islamic State had left, the representative of the group reported on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleaning the city after the remaining group of fighters hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages who were held hostage, reported to Reuters Sharfan Darvis from the Manbija Military Council's Allied SDS.
"The city is completely under our control now, but we're running clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton announced her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed that the candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charity contributions, mainly in the Clinton Fund, the former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in payment fees and the former Secretary of State declared income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her stay in the State Department.
Potential Vice-President Clinton, United States Senator Tim Kane from Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, published tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hilary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to establish a financial transparency standard," said Clinton Chief Electoral Officer Jennifer Palmieri in a statement.
Contrary to him, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and violates his previous commitments to publish his tax statements.
This is the usual case for candidates in the Presidents of the United States to publish their tax statements, although the law does not require them to do so.
The New York Businessman Trump and his lawyers called the verification of the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to publish his tax declarations.
"Your move," wrote Clinton Jan Sams, a member of the Pre-Elective Staff on Twitter, referring to the candidate's statement by a democratic party.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trump Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Tramp to issue them until the checks were completed.
The criticisms of Trump, including the candidate for Presidents of the Republican Party in 2012 by Mitta Romni and other republican members, said that his refusal raised questions about his status, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other connections, including with Russia.
Clinton caught up with the issue and released an online video on Friday, which focused on publishing Republicans who convinced Trampa to publish tax accounts.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during the economics in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception to the Presidents for decades: publish their tax declarations," she said to the assembled.
Politico reported that Trump had not paid any or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the business viewer of the New York Times quoted many tax lawyers and accountants who believed that the case might still exist.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of a dispute in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported the rule called billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who received more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska State, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under IRS, and that Trump was afraid not of the tax collection agency, but of voters.
The Clinton pre-election headquarters issued tax declarations until 2007.
Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration for 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income had been paid.
Their main investment was a low-value index pew fund, and Clinton reported dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Chili powder and fireworks preserve the protection of Tanzanian elephants
The Tanzanian environmental struggles have used a non-traditional way of preventing elephants from being overlooked in human settlements — they have put in them condoms filled with dust of chili.
The method was effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came to mind a few years ago, along with the American Committee on Nature Protection, took on its promotion by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without causing animal damage.
Many used copies to protect themselves.
Friday will be the World Day of elephants dedicated to the protection of animals.
"Since we have invented a set of instruments ..., we have seen a change in relations within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they will be able to keep elephants on their fields without harming elephants," said the Executive Director Honeyguide Damian Bell.
The first two steps are to burn the façade before the crossing of the elephant border and to give signals by means of a horn.
If he couldn't get away with it, they'd throw away the so-called chili cloud.
The chili powder mixed with the soil is placed with the gum in the condom, and its end is twisted, and only phytyl is left outside.
When the condoms are incinerated, they are melted with a small powder of chili in the air.
One dune is usually enough to spread the elephants on the other side.
The ultimate measure is the firing device that shoots Roman lights into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who have left the country after the attempted coup d'état in July of this year.
Such data led Turkey ' s head, Mevlut Chavushoglu, to a conversation with local journalists.
At the first stage, we withdrew 208 staff diplomats to continue their work in the center.
32 of them have not returned without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish foreign policy department.
Let us remember that in July Turkey attempted a coup d'état.
The authorities officially stated that the hospital had failed, and reported that more than six thousand people had been detained, including military senior and middle-aged.
As a result of the attempted coup d'état, 290 people were killed in Turkey.
Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's telephone code at the request of the Arabs -- reported channel RT News
The French director of Jewish origin had launched a scandal in the media, and found that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not have an Israel telephone code, with officials referring to "requests" from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoa, expressed his discontent with the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lansman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among States where direct calls can be made from the room.
How could it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of New Germany, Israel was excluded and eliminated?
He wrote Lanceman.
In exchange, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In seeking an explanation, the director raised this issue at the level of the hotel administration.
The answer he got there, according to Lanceman, was "shocked him."
Clark Hotel said that this measure was "a clever solution to Kempinski's hotel network management."
The reason behind this step has led to even greater anger on the part of the director.
"Most of our Arab guests, and they needed Israel's code to be removed," he said, according to Lancman, who served at the hotel.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "a terrible blow," reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shock.
What happened in Germany, and that is the hotel network, is even more shocking.
There's no need to explain.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," said the officer.
The case caused little resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that Kempinski's hotel was simply "about" to the alleged requirements of the Arab clients.
"We'd be ashamed," another post said, indicating that the hotel on Kurfurstendamm's famous street is near the synagogue.
The hotel itself has hastened the removal of any charges, calling what happened "inspection" and "excuse" before Lancman, reports the Der Spiegel newspaper.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the fast-paced list," quoted the representative of the Kempinski newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds what they've added now.
Police use liquefied gas and resin bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The students met with the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they met to protest against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used liquefied gas and resin bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to dislodge the students, resulting in the police using sand bullets and liquefied gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some of the parties to the protest could be seen writing on the graffiti walls against President Michael Temer's temporary duty.
This last protest took place just a few days after the protesters came out on the street to support President Delmo Rusef, who was removed when the Senate voted in favour of her influence.
Trade between Russia and Iran has grown by 71 per cent, reporting the RT Business portal
With the lifting of sanctions, the traffic traffic between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, according to the Ambassador of Russia to Iran, Levan Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in the interest of Russian companies in conducting business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing relations with Iran and new companies are ready to gain market access.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, traffic between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
Increased trade has been achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
Jagaryan also predicts that Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists this year.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic mission to Iran issued approximately 35,000 visas, mainly to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top-20 countries on the number of tourists visiting Russia.
You can be sure that last year's record of the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia will be beaten," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Jahd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition," he said.
The State continues to bend its heels into a defence-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the commissions of the conductor of the Almaz-Antei Group, the “loss of work” and the “loss of confidence”.
For the next three years, Gennadius Bendersky has been appointed as the leader of the NGO.
The information on the dismissal of Necorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not create a broad media resonance.
What would explain such a silence in the context of the massive rearming of the army?
Most likely, the FF management does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This time again confirms that the defence-industrial complex (OPC) has many problems and the State does not want to attract more attention from society.
The removal of Necorodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of ordering the industry.
The Almaz NGO is the group's main enterprise, which specializes in the production of marine and ground-based missile complexes.
Almaz is currently working on the establishment of the Polyment-Reduth and Morpheus RRC, which is planned to install new beds, frescoes, esmines and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia Dmitry Kornev Portal believes that the release of Necorodov is due to the collapse of the deadlines for the projects.
This version is most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007, and the introduction was expected in 2013.
"Polyment-Redut" should be the main system of WFP's newest ships.
According to the information I receive, no actual successful test has been carried out for several years.
True, as far as I can judge, there's no clear fault in Almaza, said Cornev.
The expert is afraid that a delay in operation may also occur with C-500.
The project expertise has not yet been completed, but the first complexes must enter the military during 2016.
In Minomann, they believe that “the work is being done on a planned basis and will all be completed within a set time frame”, although in 2014 the department acknowledged that there were problems with the development of the P-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has led Almaz since 2011.
Kornev noted that the project deadlines could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, it has become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in OPC and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large money, as we know, loves silence.
The Director of Defence companies usually resigns from positions of his or her own will, under the agreement of the parties or are transferred to another work.
In this case, the removal took place in public, even though it did not receive a resonance.
This suggests that the leader of Almaza was perhaps a sloppy figure and was opposed to the lower top of the "disorders".
According to the opinion, the State no longer intends to act in this manner.
It will remove those who prefer to dispute with Minio-Defence facilities and do not fulfil the tasks assigned to them.
At the same time, the FF's management is trying to punish the managing officers (starship machining).
The focus on the problems of the sector is given personally by the President.
Vladimir Putin led the Military Industrial Commission and held meetings on disarmament on a regular basis.
The Kremlin protects a number of OPC administrators, seeking to have a loyal board of directors that will comply with the orders received.
This is a far from ideal policy, but there are no State instruments in the background of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the OPC.
The current geopolitical situation in the defence is, of course, not a catastrophic one, but an incentive for the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with “cleaning” managers in the OPC, the FF's leadership is taking very successful steps to improve the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The staff of the army acquired a new quality from Sergey Shawgu, Minister of Defence.
It is hard to believe that the President has taken up a famous sentence, “You want peace, prepare for war”.
During the Cold War, the USSR military power and nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which strengthened Moscow ' s sphere of influence on the continent.
In all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, she worked very effectively.
This proved the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The trade of the “victors” in the cold war eventually turned to strengthening international terrorism.
After a series of attacks in Europe and the United States in the “Civilized World”, there was no peaceful corner left.
Despite general poverty, the West refuses to speak with Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such circumstances, our country ' s only allies remain the fleet and the army.
Strengthening the military capacity would enable Moscow to defend its national interests more effectively and to move beyond the new borders of world policy.
Shotlander Kallum Skinner hits the finish line, causing the British to take a bicycle gold.
Shotlander Kallum Skinner competed for a triumph in a male command post at a wheelhouse in Rio last night, which led to the British command trio protecting its title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old native of Glazgo was the strongest man that his Scottish friend, Sir Chris Hoy, had made his own, and the young man was proud of his history, sneaking through the finish line to win the favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain declared its right to an unexpected victory four years ago, when Hoy declared his right to a fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick, after they finished the modest sixth of the March World Championship on the London Race Cycling, even though Hoy had finished his career ever since.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of a specialist from Jamie Staff.
They did it just once when the Hindus showed up.
The care of Hoa also created the wilderness that Kean Emadi and Matt Krempton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man held by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotland, which has now been realized.
Hindez, Kenny, and Hoe’s champions four years ago, and Skinner set an Olympic record, but the norm was passed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindez was right behind him, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner backed up.
The change of strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hindez went on a larger transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoi watched from his seat as an invited expert from BBC and took the view of Skinner, Kenny and Hindez when they entered the Pedestal.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glazgo said, "This is an easy comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record at the final and won the world's champions.
That was amazing.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindus admittedly fell on track after a failed start.
He later refused to comment, and there was no way to appeal to the UK competitors.
There was no such question at this time in the greatest victory.
Hindez said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the tribunal."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We've lost so many world-famous races that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country that won seven out of 10 so-called races in both Beijing and London.
If this is the barometer of progress made in the last five months, then five more successful days await the wheel.
In the form shown by Kenny, this is not beyond the opportunity to imagine, as he repeats Hoy, winning three Olympic gold medals in one game.
This would show how Kenny, who was 12 years younger than Hoa, who was also born on 23 March (i.e., the sacred date in the British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgray, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), brings his account to six gold medals and one silver medal.
It would have been like Hoya's.
Next time, Kenny is in a sprint that starts today and is playing for three days.
A 28-year-old leaving Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it right now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your friends.
It's not easy to win one another if it's fair.
Hindez said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he's got to get rich."
It was the only one in a day playing medals, but it was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clansey, Steven Berk and Owen Doll are the fastest four-kilometre command race in four.
They ended up at 3:51,943.
The world record set for winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (10:42 dinner) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will be at the center of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, before he was trained, when officers needed him to measure his weight.
In the relevant women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Roussel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Millingavi have improved the world record, showing time 4:13.260.
The British Command has come to the conclusion that it is up to a possible team of bikers to take possession of the mid-term Olympics and earn a lot of medals.
After the truly exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have weakened in the phased preparation for Rio.
There were dramas in the second place, not least the retreat from the position of technical director Shein Satton in April due to charges of sexism and harassment, and the neglect of large figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the race for the first evening on the wheel, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain now appears to be reaching the peaks at the right time, perhaps once again.
Future Portland Metallurgical Factory threatened by the breakdown of the electricity contract
The future Portuguese aluminium factory in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is threatened by the fact that the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the factory ' s owners, is going to break the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be broken.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend the subsidies granted to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs can be threatened by Alcoa in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — can occur in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgical plant in Point Henry, leading to the closure of the power station in England last year.
Alcoa's Portland Metallurgical Factory is losing money and risking closure.
These actions resulted in discussions about the future of the plant for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later due to the price of the plant.
The company AGL, which provides large aluminum power from its Loy Yang A power station in Latrob Walli, reported that it expects that three other owners would also take steps to break the treaty.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the joint short-term business of Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp have smaller shares.
"The company AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to work, that is, the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are so-called ‘heged contracts’ that were due to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month disengagement period, so they actually end in 2017.
"Respectively, AGL still expects these contracts to bring their share of their income in 2017," said the electricity company.
Any potential impact on AGL's profits from the financial year 2018 to date is limited to projections of the strong future market for optimising electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accounting for $187 million in terms of “future disbursement”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate a metallurgical plant or to supply electricity to a metallurgical plant”.
The American company stated that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it still had to explain why it had broken the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, the head of the AGL company Steven Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually, and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
For us, as for the manufacturer, it will be bad," he said.
Not only the realist star of the Cardassian show, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, model and the fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Chris' mother manager, appeared on the ruling September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the brand's face Estee Lauder, described fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this wall and cried," wrote Kendall.
The news of the siege was accompanied by strange (or simply by the Cardassian Family?) video reality, in which the entire Cardassian-Jenner family (the Rob and Caitlin debossiers, also the most popular show business uncle, the producer of Cardassian Family Ryan Sikrest), forgot about the presence of the sister on the siege, and in the end, the classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
This is the standard summary line for almost all children's television shows dedicated to birthdays. (The Secretary says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the multi-story rabbit from the program at 8:00 a.m.), but Chris needed this fame to be achieved by other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have no doubt entered the new era of the Cardassian show.
Let Kendall Kim's older sister get on the cover of Vogue earlier (she showed up on it with her husband Kany West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is the achievement of itself.
The September issue is the most sold Vogue issue in a year.
With a thickness similar to the gift edition than the fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the fashionist portal, 615 pages from the last year's 832 pages of advertising).
News of who from the stars would fall on his cover is expected to be so impatient that in the last two years the photographs of the magazine have merged to the official ad.
Among the previous women who had fallen into the siege were Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has, of course, been more “remarkables working in models” than “remarkable models”.
The winner of the Oscar Prize and the face of the Dior Jennifer Laurence brand was presented on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gage was honored.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, whom the magazine described as the "excellent model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of known people, reality stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (though Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful careers for the Lemonade album.
Of course, it's not all good luck Jenner.
The Jenner situation in the world of fashion, given her last star of television reality-show, was always supposed to be a joke.
In June, one of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour's first models criticized Jenner and her colleague Giji Hadid, calling them "wounds of the moment."
These moods were once again disturbed by the news of Jenner's appearance on the Vogue wall.
But it doesn't make sense to get around.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
It is a supermodel in all the meanings of that word.
She's defiling Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you ton cream from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you their photos in their own apps, which are available on payroll.
She sells her own photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter in LOVE magazine.
And in a free time, maybe still seeing her sister Courtney and her children, she's participating in a reality show on television.
Public legal centres refuse to provide 160,000 persons a year
Each year, more than 160,000 least-protected representatives of the population refuse to serve in public legal centres, as the sector is prepared for an effect that will further cut funding to and from the scope of its activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to combat unfair deprivation of property, and so on — have already been given abstinence by seeking free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services already operating outside the scope of the scope are preparing for further reductions.
From June next year, these legal centres should lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of Public Legal Centres of Queensland James Farrell said that according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people have been dismissed annually.
Farrell said that if the federal Government ' s decision was not annulled, the situation would only deteriorate.
"The public legal centres of Queensland are constantly receiving insufficient funding: this means that thousands of people are being deprived of the vital services they need," he said.
People from violent relationships have problems of a legal nature, and this account shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will fund 30 per cent since June 2017, which means thousands of less protected residents of Queensland will be forced to address complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis to cancel these reductions immediately so that people can receive the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the Government had fulfilled its obligation to raise the funding of free legal aid to the country ' s average.
Now is the time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and the Government of Palastuk is time for this important work.
Donald Trampa's pre-election headquarters was brought to trial after he was allegedly threatened by a gun.
According to New York reports, Donald Tramp was tried at the pre-election headquarters: it is alleged that the headquarters did not do anything after the announcement that his Operational Director in North Carolina had threatened a gun to the staff member when they were driving to the jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court case filed on Wednesday with the State Court in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former programmer at the pre-election state headquarters.
Bordini said he'd waited a few months to solve the problem internally, but he realized that it wouldn't happen.
Director Earl Phillip "drawed out the gun, put his right index finger on the dick and put a door on Vincent's knee," says Bordini in a complaint.
With a view to the local and regional pre-election headquarters, Bordini understood that at least four more persons had become participants in similar incidents with Phillip, was approved.
"The guns don't have to shoot to hurt," Bordini said in a complaint.
The claim took place only two days after the Presidents of the Republican Party had issued a furor, he told listeners in North Carolina that "the people of the Second Amendment" — understood as owners of weapons and his loved ones — could begin to act if his rival, Hillary Clinton, was elected and could choose judges.
The Trampa Pre-election Headquarters said that the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not spoken in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini sought compensation from the pre-election headquarters for his failure to control, and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, abuse and moral harm.
The representative of Trampa Hope Hicks was mild in response to the request to comment.
Trying to talk to Phillip wasn't successful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left pre-election headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, the Innovation Consulting Services, no one has called quickly.
The candidate for presidents from the Republican Party, Donald Trump, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg District Court (Charlott).
Britain must move the Olympic spirit into the right direction and expand the city
He will also bring reinvigoration and prosperity not only in our local settlements and in general throughout London but throughout the country.
In my view, this was the huge advantage of Hithrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to make our peoples and regions benefit from the Game.
The Olympics have been of great benefit to Stratford and East End.
And we'll do it again, creating opportunities for locals and businesses near Hithrow.
We will create 10,000 new traineeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London in 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics, and that we would be in a difficult position on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be proved wrong about Himtrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hithru answers any question he may have.
Like the Winter Olympics, it is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a wonderful team in Heathrow, which has implemented a programme of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment in time and within the budget, from T5, selected by the best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of two of the world's most busy runways.
They are now ready to provide the third landing zone, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for Britain, and I am sure that the expansion of Hitrow will also be.
It is time for us to send the spirit of the Olympics into the right direction and to expand Hitler, guaranteeing our future of trade and creating a legacy of skills and jobs that Britain may be proud of.

Adblock Plus, Facebook plays in "cats" about blocking advertising
For companies that make money on the internet, attempts to bypass software for blocking advertising are a game in "cats", according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, almost a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block the blockers on its desktop version, Adblock Plus published a blog entry that users could update their filters in the program to block the advertising in the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site would change the edge of its advertising to make it more difficult for blockers to identify which parts of the advertising page are.
But Adblock now claims he was able to bypass the new code.
In his blog, the representative of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that “such a kind of mutual fight between the community of blockers of advertising with an open source and those who are trying to bypass it is continuing from the moment of blocking the advertisement”, and that Facebook might present its own decision in the near future.
The fact that the largest social network in the world has entered into combat is a clear sign of how big a problem the advertising blockers for industry have become.
Around 200 million people around the world are using advertising blockers, according to last year's Pagefair and Adobe study; almost four times the number of people using such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion active daily users entering Facebook through mobile devices, mobile advertising is now 84 per cent of Facebook's revenue from advertising.
However, the company is pursuing desktop blockers because mobile blockers are ineffective in Facebook mobile applications for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
However, the advertising in the desktop version is a sufficient income item to make Facebook think of such a positive investment.
Facebook also announced on Thursday that it is going to update its “ad preferences” tool to give people more control over how they are targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook said that new Adblock filters caused concern, as they would also block some unadvertised content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to address this problem," said the Facebook representative in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a cruel tool, so instead we have focused on creating tools such as Advertising Preferences to deliver governance to people.
A woman was transferred to a Swiss highway in an episode of apparent suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a couple of vehicles were moved on the highway early in the morning to Thursday for a clear attempt to kill themselves.
The incident occurred on A1 near Morge in the canton immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark of “despair” and she was hit by several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill themselves, the victim, a Swiss woman at the age of 49, hit several vehicles, including the truck.
She died on the spot.
Several incarcerated drivers have already been questioned, but the identity of some has not yet been established, the police, who have called them and someone else who witnessed the incident, responded.
A criminal case, a “logical” step in such a situation, was initiated, said lawyer Zile Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be ascertained whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the impact?
This is what the prosecutor has to determine," Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both involving a person in the dark on the highway — it was convicted that drivers cannot expect an accident when walking on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of the death of the unwarranted after she struck and killed a man lying on A1 near Payern on the night of August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, heard the court.
The court found that a police woman, who had responded to the emergency challenge, had managed the vehicle in a way that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was “a perfectly exclusive and unpredictable situation”, the judge said.
Someone who has information on the incident on Thursday near Morge must call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have been once inhabited, according to estimates of the new NASA climate model.
The students from the Nassow Institute of Space Studies of Goddard developed a model for the study of the past of Venus, using instruments and algorithms similar to those applied by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have a hot waterless surface and an atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide, ever having conditions similar to that of the earth.
The students had previously assumed that the low speed of Venera's return was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the last modeling suggests that Venus could probably have a split atmosphere like the Earth and still slowly back.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid extinction.
Previously, Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent of the cloud.
"According to the GISS model, the slow return of Venus represents her daily sun almost twice a month," explained in a press release from GISS Anthony Del Henio.
It warms the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a dense layer of clouds that acts as a sun that protects the planet from the substantial heat of the sun.
The result is average climate temperatures, which are, by and large, several degrees colder than they are today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development that scientists had previously predicted to explore the planet.
Although Venus once may have been inhabited, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans disappeared and her water pair was burned with ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen flew away, only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — Venus, which we know today.
Researchers have shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy is leaving the Avalanche team coach post.
Patrick Roy resigned from his position as coach and vice-president of Colorado Avalanche's hockey activity on Thursday, referring to the lack of influence during the decision-making process in the team.
Executive Vice-President/Chief Commander of the Colorado Team Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I've been performing my duties as chief coach and vice-president of Colorado Avalanche's hockey activity with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I spent a lot of time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needed and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and the Vice-President of hockey activities must coincide perfectly with the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote when making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patric told me about his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy became the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best league coach in his first season with Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He brought the club to 112 points and victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was smashed by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and lost playoffs in the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points were left from the Wild team to fight for a second favourable trip to the Western Conference.
The doorman from the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Cube Stanleys — two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
The North Sea Oilers resumed negotiations and delayed the strike
The oil wage strikes in the North Sea have been suspended, and all parties to the discussion have begun a new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties have reported.
The attacks against the Wood Group oil-servicing company were sporadicly organized on the platforms in the North Sea under the Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the United and RMT Unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes," the joint statement states.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting next week to take a fresh look at the problems.
The trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first over 25 years, was directed against potential wage reductions of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group this year reduced the rates paid to contract staff working in the North Sea by approximately 9 per cent due to negative market tensions.
A decrease in the company's rates occurred after a 10% reduction in the rates for contract staff working on the beach in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions would give her the space needed to overcome the market decline.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil-gas activities in countries by 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-mixing with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from the low prices of crude oil: the economic situation has deteriorated by the decision to leave the European Union, which was adopted in June.
The Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, yes and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for most people, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion of new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average value of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of returning the stars to the Pleiade.
The last Space Telescope mission, Kepler, has helped astronomers to collect the most complete directory of return speeds from the Pleiades.
New data helps astronomers to understand why the stars are spinning at different speeds and how the times of rotation are related to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luis Ribal, a scientist at the Centre for Infrastructure Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleiade is located in 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the collection are now only mature; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They'll be back as fast as they'll ever be.
At their peak speed, these adult stars emit large amounts of air.
As they travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds act as a braking force on the stars.
As the star grows older, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of known star fins — such as solar fins.
The new speed index assumes that more massive stars are returning slower than less massive stars.
The fish compares stars to dancers: larger pirates make them slower than smaller ones.
"In the Ballet, we observe that those who turn slowly are usually more massive, while those who turn faster are usually very light stars," said the Fishman.
As the Pleiade is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparison of star properties with speeds of return.
"The Pleiade's constellation provides a starting point for the theoretical models of returning stars, both younger and older," said Fishell.
We still want to know where and why the stars slow down the speed of their return and wear their dance shoes.
Fishall and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiade's speed of return in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A study on the activities of a group of Ukrainian divers detained in Crimea is conducted by two agencies, writes "Commersent".
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of diversions in Crimea.
As previously reported, confessions were given by the Ukrainian city of Energodar Evgenien Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the outcome.
According to him, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armenia, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerchen Paramaure, the gas pipeline, and one of the military aerodromes.
Law-enforcement officials believe that detention has been far from possible.
This has, in particular, been the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev court of Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanislav Churchesov is the main coach of the Russian football assembly.
At the meeting of the Russian Football Union, a decision was taken to appoint Stanislav Churchessov as the leading Russian football coach.
The contract will be awarded for two years before the end of CM-2018.
On 11 August, RFS was appointed as the leading coach of the Russian football band Stanislav Čerchesov.
He was a well-known footballer who had previously played in the Moscow Spartacus in the position of the door, as well as a coach with solid experience as a teacher of Russian teams such as Spartacus, Zemchužina-Sochi, Terek, Amkar, Dynam, and the Warsaw Legion, who became the winner of the national championship and the country's cube.
It is reported that the contract with Churchess will be signed as soon as possible and calculated for two years.
Thus, it is his duty to prepare a rally for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that Miroslav Romaštenko, Gintaras Stauce, Vladimir Panikov will enter his training station.
There is information that the total salary of the training staff will be 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the media, the RFS leadership has set before Stanislav Churchus the goal of bringing the Russian assembly to the semifinal and winning medals.
As the coach himself said, he considered the creation of a competitive environment in the team as a priority and was going to give footballers an opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Churchess, he's glad the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of the Church of Russia will be held in Antalya on 31 August, which will be a joint meeting with the Turkish team.
In the past, Leonid Słucky, who combined him with coaching at the CSCA, was a leading Russian football coach.
He stated his resignation after the Russian national team's Euro-2016 performance in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor outcome of the collection.
Regrettably between Angola and the YAR, Namibia suffered a great deal during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, after independence from South Africa in 1990, that country, with a population of 2.4 million, has achieved tremendous success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is the Government ' s emphasis on education.
While people in developed countries see themselves as understanding free primary and secondary education, many poor countries in secondary and even primary schools require education.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce training for “cost-recovery”.
However, primary school education is free in Namibia.
Moreover, higher education has become free since 2015.
The authorities also work actively in other important areas.
The efforts to eliminate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases of disease by 97 per cent over the past ten years.
In contrast to the international trend in the growth of inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini ratio, which is the standard rate of income inequality, has dropped by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this score was one of the highest in the world.
Poverty decreased from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) also decreased from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest rate of freedom of expression in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country has significantly surpassed the United States and other rich States.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Transparency International Human Rights Index.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia is able to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt ratio to GDP is around 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The level of unemployment, at least by traditional methods of assessment, remains sufficiently high - almost 28 per cent.
Like other countries in the region, the high level of HIV/AIDS disease in Namibia is almost 17 per cent of the population.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is among the countries with above average income, but the authorities insist that their State is indeed a developing country.
Namibia is, of course, faced with some of the difficulties faced by the weakly developed economies.
The State must develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
In the country, isolated breeds of hunter-gatherer breeds live in deserts, which must somehow be integrated into modern society without losing their identity.
The integration of people who were on the periphery of the world economy four centuries ago was a challenge for any country.
It is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it faces the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia did not intend to give up, and the country was addressing its problems.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities were involved in the creation of a diversified economy and a united society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have gathered together to work for common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical services not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
Approximately 15-20 per cent of visitors to medical institutions in the northern areas of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that separates the country from poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians understood that their neighbours did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate with them, to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional health projects, to encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Government of Namibia rightly argued that rich natural resources could easily be cursed by contributing to the wealth of a few from many.
The authorities understand that Namibia ' s income from natural resources needs to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacity.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum proceeds from the sale of resources and to review investment laws and contracts to ensure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, so strong support by the Government for freedom of speech is so important.
As Hage Gaeingob's head of State said, the media often said that he did not like it.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has acquired, says the President.
Not all Namibia ' s key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are renewables, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
More than one million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia shows that even those countries that start with serious shortcomings - racism, colonial construction, inequality and low levels of development - can stand in the way of general prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the Golden Varna - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 years before our era).
Please, this was the largest archaeological sensation in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found to be more than 3,000 pounds [6 kg] in the excavations of Varna Necropolis.
Only one burial known as “Mogile No. 43” was extracted from 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the oldest gold of the world can soon be seen as a bus found by archaeologists in July of this year.
Once again in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as Tel Yunaki.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tel Yunakis is located far from the sea, near the village of the Yunakis of the Pazardjik region.
The bus is a gold strip wrapped in a ring.
Yavor Beyojiev, the head of the excavation at Tele Yunaci, dated 4600 years before our era and stated that she was the oldest of Varna's gold for at least 200 years.
Varna’s treasures are dated about the same period from 4600 to 4200 B.C.E.
There are currently no technologies to accurately date metal.
How can you be sure of what gold is older?
Professor Beaujiev obviously knows more than he told the agency Reuters: "I am absolutely sure that the gold of the Greeks is greater than the gold of Varna."
It's an extremely important finding: it's a tiny object, but it's big enough to take a good place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Byojiev, scientists reported that soon they were analyzing the composition of the metal and re-examined the archaeological layer where a gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bus as accurately as possible.
The location also explains a lot.
Tel Yunaki is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Tel Yunaki is now considered the oldest "city" in Europe.
Tel was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium B.C.E.
During the centuries that followed, metal processing in the region developed rapidly, from the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a fully valued industry.
There is a special name in the family history of this archaeological community: the Balkan-Carpathian Metallurgical Province.
In the 5th millenniums before our era around the metal processing centres, settlements of the urban type began to emerge.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tel Yunacati may be the oldest, since the artifacts were found here in 4900 B.C.E.
I would call Tel Yunaki a prototype of the modern city, although it is a much older settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"It's a place that's over Shomera for a thousand years," said Beaujiev, referring to the common view that urban culture was born in southern Mesopotamia - modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the ordinary sense of that word.
The excavations of Tel Yunaki have taken place since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have dug up nearly 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall were found, which had reached a height of three meters.
There is little left from houses and masters, but archaeologists are clearly different from the streets, public buildings, urban flats, business centers and residential areas.
Tel Yunacs are often called Bird City: there were dozens of clay figures found here.
All birds are represented in a state of peace, from which they are assumed not to be decorative objects but to be objects of local worship.
The Bird City was destroyed about 4100 before our era -- perhaps by the Indo-European tribes from the north-east.
There were no cities in the caravans, so there were horses and weapons.
The three-metre fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of brutal warfare: remains of the elderly, women and children have been found inside the houses with injuries caused by the beatings.
New findings and new facts appear annually, changing the usual perceptions of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking, not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" of Europe's first civilization born in the Balkans.
The gold of Varna, found relatively recently in 1972, became a powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization.
It makes sense that Varna's golden rose was supposed to be something ahead of it -- something like a tiny golden bush set up in Telle Yunacai.
In Porsche, the model 911 Targa is artificially old.
It has been officially stated that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being prepared by the team's manual specialists working with serial machines.
The "Retro-Luc" is, for example, in the special color of the body Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - in this color is even a logo of the model.
In addition, the market received a corporate white graph along the boards and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheels, as well as some body design details carved into “white-golden metal”.
The retro-reflector inside is much less: it is very different from the sero-synthetic range of the design, new panes with extended ranges of electrical regulation and separate black anodized steel with the unit logo.
In addition, when a special version is purchased, each buyer will receive a car ticket of cheques and a richly separated album with photographs of the production process.
Porsche Exclusive Specialists have not been able to touch: the retro-targa by characteristics is completely consistent with the series.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharge capacity of 3.0 l, developing 420 B.C.E. and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S is capable of accelerating up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued with limited circulation, but neither its volume nor the value of each particular athlete will be reported.
Facebook and the blockers of the commercials unbundled the “arms race”
The recent implementation of Facebook technology to prevent the cover-up of ads on the sites of the Society has prompted decision-makers to block the advertising of responses.
At AdBlock Plus, "opposite" was released, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus has announced its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
The members of the community noted that, in order to deceive the new “unblocked” advertising technology, the AdBlock Plus decision, along with commercial announcements, also blocks many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
On Facebook, they regretted such an AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source from the TechCrunch edition, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop site will be ready within the next few hours.
Thus, the interceptors and blockers have released their kind of “arms race”, trying to win each other, who have been affected by it, have become users who have missed interesting records from friends or who have seen advertisements where they are not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertising have recently caused heated disputes.
In Murmansk, the violent man will appear before the court · Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been completed in the Investigation Committee of the Russian Federation on the Murmanian Region.
The 54-year-old accused is very serious about committing violent sexual acts.
As a result, it was found that at the end of November 2015 the accused in the area of Paul's street in Murmansk had committed sexual violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sanctions provided for in that article provide for a maximum penalty in the form of deprivation of liberty for up to six years.
Dongfeng brings the Russian Crossween Fengguang 370 and the Rich New Pickup - Web site www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the Chinese class of cars that combine the dignity of minivan and cruisers.
Another Russian prime minister is Pickup Rich New.
Many Western companies in Moscow decided to ignore this year's international car fair, so the desert of the Crocus Expo exhibition halls will fill the Chinese companies.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has a great deal on the Russian market and intends to offer a number of interesting news to our car lovers in the near future.
One of them will be Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which has been sold in China at this spring price of 55,900 yuan (less than 550 thousand yuan).
The Russians are hardly aware that the issue of shipments to our country is still under discussion.
In China, Fengguang 370, as a result of the June sale, was able to reach the 11th place in the list of the most sold minivans, although due to high road education (175 mm) and the protective plastic coating on the lower perimeter of the body, it can be attributed to crossovers.
Crossvene is built on the front-end platform of the lower model Fengguang 360, with 370 of the same wheel base in 2725 mm, but the cubs hear longer (4565 mm vs. 4510 mm), more solid design and equipment.
The living room is decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical sensor screen "as in Tesla" on the central console was only on the early exhibition copies of the Crosswive, and the machines with "music" were easily sold.
Five of the seven seating positions are easy to hold, forming a 1650 mm load area with a maximum of 1500 litres.
The Fengguang 370 engine has only one - 1.5 litre gas "atmospheric" with 115 C.E., coupled with a 5-degree mechanical transfer box.
With regard to the dynamic quality of the machine, the manufacturer modestly reduces it, as he promises the saving budget of the owner to appetite at 6.7 l/100 km.
Pikap Rich New is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara of the requested generation, but with a distorted Chinese designer.
Despite moral ageing, this model has so far been used as a stable demand for the Chinese consumer as a reliable and inconvenient “worker’s sword”.
At the same price, Rich New is probably interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become extremely expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines for choice: petrol 2.4 l (137 l) or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 l).
The transmission box is only a mechanical device, the device is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a rigidly connected front.
It will be on Dongfeng stand and a new flagship seat A9, his Russian Prime Minister's representation of the Chinese company announced yet in June.
Minor crossovers on the Chinese market are growing, one of the latest news - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Linear Dongfeng consists of two models: the S30 seat and the H30 Cross Hatchbek.
In seven months this year, the Chinese company's dealers made 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notices will cease to be sent by mail - www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has amended the order of transmission of notifications of property taxes.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to the scheme that has not changed in the past years: in summer and in the autumn, they receive almost a ticket for the transport tax for the previous year.
However, many will not be expected this year.
The fact is that the tax inspection without much noise has changed the order of notification of citizens.
To those registered in the Personal Tax Office on the official website of the journal.ru, the notices will come in electronic form.
In the inspections, such Russians were automatically considered as online users and were excluded from the standard, "paper" transmission.
The latest comes from all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All others will continue to receive regular letters.
However, there is also an opportunity to return to the old scheme of account holders on the website.
To this end, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after it is drawn up, when the letter will go for a few days and may be lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet tax inspection service has exceeded 18 million people, allowing the department to seriously save on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly insufficient to inform citizens of the change in order.
Some could have registered in the “personal office” for a one-time service and had long forgotten about it.
These people are not expected to receive reports, and they are not aware that they will fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the Personal Tax Office is made in three ways: through a gosuslugi.ru account, by electronic signature or login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally in any of the tax inspection offices (independent of the place of entry).
We recall that transport tax should be paid by 1 December this year.
The transmission of notifications began in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, in which the preparations are aimed at achieving a very high impact, is a thing.
But the controversial concept did not disturb G-Power's masters, who took over the modification of the Mercedes-AMG G 63 sport.
G-Power is known for its passion for BMW cars, but nothing human to its masters is foreign.
Indeed, why not improve G 63 - 571-strong flying couval with aerodynamic tank and discharge up to a hundred by 5.4 s?
By curing the "muscle" of a mixture of "gelica", the master took advantage of the advantage that opened up a 5.5 litre super-inhaled "eight."
And here's the dynamics of the run up to a hundred has improved to an indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "kirpice" is capable of fishing for 5.3 s.
However, speeds from average speeds are likely to be significantly better for him.
Speed fluctuations: if standard G 63 does not move at a faster speed than 210 km/h, the Tuning Alley with a disabled electronic "axial" is capable of exceeding 250 km/h.
Vehicles are practically different from their factory station, except for 23-inch Hurricane RR 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury unit Mercedes-Maybach announced a stunning 6-metre concept cup that will be presented in the Pebbl Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with a "green subbrand" BMW i and will advance its electric models under a separate brand.
At least four environmental news reports are expected in the coming years.
