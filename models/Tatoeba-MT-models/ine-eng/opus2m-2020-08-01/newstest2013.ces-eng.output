Re-election strategy of the Republican Party against Obama
Republican leaders have justified their policy on the need to fight electoral fraud.
Brennan’s centre, however, marks such fraud as a myth that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die after a lightning strike.
In the last ten years, only 300 cases of election fraud have been reported by the Republican lawyers in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. is responsible for the organization of federal elections by individual states.
And in this spirit, most American governments have been making new laws since 2009 that make the election process or the election list more difficult.
This event marked a turning point after the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives arrived in 26 countries.
As a result, only 180 proposals for a law restricting electoral rights in 41 countries were submitted in 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to submit an identity card with a photo and a document on American citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, exercise the right to register on the list of voters on the day of the election and withdraw the right to vote for citizens with an entry in the criminal register.
Before the 2006 elections, he did not require any American state to submit an identity card to the polls.
The first state to implement this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indian Law was confirmed in 2008 by the United States Supreme Court.
The Republican authorities have been in a hurry to extend this process to other countries.
In the last two years, the proposals for such laws have been supported in 34 countries with the aim of forcing voters to submit identity cards with photographs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal certificate of identity, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people of age who can choose, do not have a photo ID issued by their state government.
There are no such identity certificates for about five million new volunteers in 2012.
In addition, the required identity card is often worth more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions concern mainly young people, minority members and low-income persons.
25% African Americans, 15% under $35,000; 18% of citizens aged 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years therefore do not have the required identity with the photograph.
And that's not all.
Students who are voters aware of their contribution to democratic candidates are not entitled in several countries to use their identity card with the photos produced by their school.
On the other hand, the same Member States shall allow members of the fishing or fishing clubs who choose more Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in the elections.
Until 2004, no state required a citizenship document in the elections.
The first such request led to Arizona.
Since 2011, about twelve states have adopted a law setting out the obligation of volunteers to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim at limiting the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics are giving priority to the democratic side.
In 2011, Republican legislators supported eight states of the law that disrupts voter registration on election day.
In addition, they have restricted the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to volunteers who want to register.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the general elections in 2004, campaigns to register voters helped about 10 million people.
The measures adopted after 2009 but led to a decrease in the registration of new volumes in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
The Republican legislators then adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for elections in advance in five other states.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the members of the Afro-Americans were elected in favour, although only 13% of the Afro-Americans were elected in that state.
The Spanish did the same.
They made only 11% of all the voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in favour.
On the other hand, the whites, who represented 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of the voters who voted in favour.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have been very important against the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Democratic governors have blocked a number of bill proposals by their veto.
In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States has even been indicted.
In part, they managed to limit their damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 countries have adopted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card.
However, the newly introduced rules are totally unconcerned about the exercise of voting rights in 2012.
The democratic criticism is mainly about the presumption of the rule of law and is seen as a clear attempt to influence the outcome of the 2012 elections in key countries.
The report by the Brennan Centre in 2011 shows that the states where these laws were approved represent 171 of the 270 votes in the election of the voters necessary for victory in the presidential elections.
It is too soon to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
One thing is certain already today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Discovery of prostate cancer: complete the investigation or not?
The PSA test has led to faulty results that were improperly negative or even improperly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All this has added to the tendency of men who have already been so reluctant to go to the exam at all.
Stop being investigated or not?
We asked for an opinion from two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, a high level of contamination between individual groups tested is therefore difficult to interpret these results and to make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a difference in mortality between patients who underwent the investigation and those who did not.
This study also showed after a 12-year drop that those who are unable to investigate have a 30% to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
So I recommend a 50-year-old examination or 40-year-old if your immediate relative had prostate cancer.
The most dangerous group is also men of African American origin.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species that are not available.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to patients the safety of its type of cancer, offer possible alternatives, not necessarily treat prostate cancer that does not affect life in the long term, and to focus in these cases rather on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, a number of men diagnosed with cancer do not treat it because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not endanger their lives.
We will encourage them to carry out active surveillance and we will offer them treatment in case of disease progress.
More and more often and more precisely, we define the criteria that help decide which kind of treatment and which does not.
However, I recommend that the examination be completed.
However, it is important to have an interview with your doctor and to determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember Movement has created a tool to assess for and against the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous approach to cancer prevention.
Despite progress in research, the best means to reduce the risk of disease is to adopt the principle of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and moved enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this data would amount to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, a spokesperson for Canadian cancer research.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of the cancer disease causes hereditary problems.
Some percent also remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer research company, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even if the number of smokers is falling.
Cigarettes account for 85% of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It's insidiously harmful to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million chickens in Quebec today," the head of the speaker, André Beaulieu.
Exciting data: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of death is reduced to half-carcinoma.
Weight
Bodyhood and obesity are, according to the SCC, another risk factor for developing a disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat stomach and limb, jaundice, mucous membranes and joints.
"The research has shown that regular physical activity for the rest of its life protects against cancer of the fat stomach," the report adds.
Survival
It also recommends that the consumption of red meat be reduced.
Too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also appropriate to warn against practices for which the same applies.
Conservation of the meat with anorexia, drying or salt may lead to the production of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to cancer development," the report adds.
Vitamins
In recent times, different scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, studies have not yet produced clear conclusions.
Studies aimed at vitamin E are fragmented according to the SCC.
Although according to one of them, the risk of prostate cancer is reduced, another study says more about its increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulieu continues to say how important it is to talk about his fears and family backgrounds with his doctor.
"Deploying the investigation doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs Boon studied
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs' Boone caused a legitimate confusion during the summer.
There is a view that this boron is divided into a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And then it's the last particle whose existence predicts a standard model - our best or "minimum" explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter - that has not yet been empirically observed.
However, among physics, there is no trace of certainty that Higgs's Boon.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very much like the Higgs Boone, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the large physical congress in Kyoto are more corroborated, but all the data are still missing so that we can have absolute certainty.
Let us assume, however, that this is Higgs' boon, because the risk of error appears small, and let's see if it's actually going.
In this world, there is a completely unquestionable law that cannot exist at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it is shown that it also applies a similar law: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot take the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" almost literally creates some of their properties.
It also divides physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find organized citizens, or farmers, who respect Paul’s principle.
And at the second end, the boons move, according to anarchists who don't care about anything - definitely not this principle, which means that they can be at the same place at the same time.
These boons are further divided into two groups according to the equipment (including absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: the meats that we leave here without mention, and the "power particles", with which large natural forces spread and with which Higgs boons are probably associated in some way.
It must be said, however, that these boons are not as exotic as they could be thought.
If you read this article, it's because of a box with unusual banality: photon, or "parts of light", which is "carrying" electromagnetic forces.
When particles with an electric shock accelerate or alter their direction, they "distort" by means of the electromagnetic field in this particular place, as well as the shell cast into the fisher.
From this "disruption" there will be an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photon - and thus one of the Boons, "power carriers".
More stable fields
It's also with the Higgs Boon, only with the difference that "distortion" is necessary to another field, the Higgs' field to show up.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than electromagnetic fields; its excitement must be achieved by very high energy values, as is the case with the frozen fisher's level, which is already losing only a very large balance.
For this reason, it is necessary to use a huge part accelerator as a part accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with the impactor connections is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
Analogies with the electromagnetic field are again suitable for explaining the relationship between Higgs and the mass.
The electromagnetic field does not respond to all particles or all materials.
Some, for example, magnets, do so, but others do not - piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself on the refrigerator.
And it's also true that with Higgs field they don't react all the particles: those who do so have a certain mass, while others (such as photos, let's look at it) don't have it.
And Mrs. Novak's asking what all these research is, what do they bring us?
From the point of view of science, it is the confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which enables physicists to analyse any inconsistencies between observation and predictions of the MS.
In addition, few physicists literally wish they could be found because the smallest difference could open space for "new physics" and heal some gaps in the model.
It is necessary to note that the model still has huge deficiencies, does not provide any explanation of gravity (ooh!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe's mass (ooh!).
However, the CERN has not yet shown such a dispute.
Replies
The answers to these researches in your daily life and Mrs. Novak's can only be predicted very difficult, but it would be a mistake to think that there will be no.
See: At the very beginning of the 1960s, laser advancers in Bell laboratories had no idea of the revolution that their work was causing.
They predicted scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first constant laser paddle (formerly the papriks were pulsed) in 1962, I already said - the laser was initially considered such a "toy to the laboratory".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application may also come out of all the tools that surround research.
For example, Aunt Willard Boyle created a small light camera in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This camera, although Boyle didn't plan at first, now serves as an "eye" of all the digital cameras in the world and gave him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
Of course it doesn't mean that activities around LHC have to change our lives, but it means that man never really knows...
Paliative Care - Best way to get out of life...
By means of his Commission on Dignity for Death, Quebec has recently taken on a horrific issue regarding the end of life.
The debate should continue as soon as possible and at the same time the draft law will be put in place.
There is still much work to be done in this main area.
Le Devoir's magazine tried to look at this question in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégia.
The cancer of the prostate that fed her gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's already seven," he says without emotion on his bed in the house for the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its job: the insatiable weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just eat himself.
He looks at the tasty breakfast and agrees that we can help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop with him, bring him drugs, offer him a bath.
He's brave to the usual death.
"My greatest desire is to get rid of this passage, it humiliates me," she confesses.
A few hours later, he found a team of doctors on his problem medication.
"A man learns throughout his life that men are wet," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of the child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the person," whether he accepts the return, says a psychologist.
In the view of a number of people taking palliative care, the main moments are played in the very core of such return.
Patients who go home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care are all suffering from cancer.
Their forecast is up to three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses who care for them do not provide so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, it is the worst fear of dying "inhaling in full consciousness".
But I couldn't find my kids.
"I have good kids," he says.
"I no longer have any wishes in my life," she says, and then she lets us put on her breathing device.
Yet he still looks forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the following days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provide body care with food.
That's what palliative care looks like, if you can't do anything else anymore.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec there is one bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize we're all gonna die once.
Here life continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, he can be provided with brandy or peps, depending on taste.
Diabetics don't have to watch sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of everyday life here.
Last night they brought a beer to Mr. X. who died later in the night.
This morning, his son will drink beer to honor his late father.
"We help patients as close as they are," says Nathalie Savard, director of the care service.
In Victor-Gadbois' house, they go after each other for days, but they don't like each other.
Next to a 30-year-old man who is delighted to meet his family carefully on his pillows, while they join him in his honor, a tragic 16-year-old man who is surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children dies after he has tried every chance of surviving.
"For half a year, there are always three to five beds here, which are designed for people with cancer under 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who come to Victor-Gadbois' home come here from their homes, 47% from their hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care, which is intended to alleviate suffering as soon as the patient reaches the final phase of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois and the Grand Montreal Home Paliative Treatment Society, specialize more exclusively in the care of oncological patients.
And this fundamental inaccessibility of health care in Quebec leads to the fact that a number of doctors specializing in palliative care are concerned about the adoption of the euthanasia and assisted suicide law.
Since October, there has been a manifestly signed peak in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, where they present their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martelov, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that all people have access to quality palliative care before they can agree to euthanase.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency in great pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
It is feared that patients should not be asked to die for the reason that they are not being treated properly.
At the same time, it is true that a number of oncologists care for their patients until the last few minutes, regardless of the adverse forecast.
Hopes for the survival of Hélène Richards have already been minimal when she left high-risk chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was out of treatment, she answered that she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she told us.
And then she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who want to die are grateful to their treating doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative team has relieved them of their pain.
It must be said, however, that palliative care is certainly not all - powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care in the Grand Montreal Home Palliative Care Community, patients are prevented from treatment of pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, physicians often use palliative sedatives, which the patient will manage until the end of the day, either aggressively or permanently.
It cannot be said that we do not take part in this suffering.
A patient we're not going to relieve of pain will have an ever-increasing chance of access to palliative sedatives.
The helpless, who are not provided with sedatives, always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't always necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means "I want you to relieve me of my pain."
The implementation of this report provided a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Large-scale real-world scandals in Quebec
Travel management officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, politicians lobbyists and experts at the Italian mafia are still telling what they know about the amazing "system", which includes construction, state officials, politicians, experts and mafia.
This "field" came to Quebec taxpayers very expensive especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has broken apart since we took the basic measures," ironically says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebecan MP and former police chief in Montreal.
This led to the launch of a 2011 scandal on the basis of a consistent investigation into the financing of road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved until after long delays.
Duchesneau's report confirmed a direct link between industry, transparency in the financing of the parties and corruption of state officials.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport has been saving for billions of dollars' orders," when some people held on to their instincts to get a share on them!
Charbonneau's commission "which has led to the demise of two elders," adds with hope that it will be able to "discover the essence of some people".
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition to this, policemen "Marteau's family" have since 2009 ensured that the display "cash cartel" significantly calms the intrusion of orders...
In recent weeks, a number of visits have been conducted and they have denounced the fraud and corruption of a number of general representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of one of the municipalities.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post of mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
It is suspected that he has repeatedly accepted payments in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurs and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito called for a sensation when the commission explained the "system" mechanism of obtaining public contracts.
During these years, he devoted himself 3% of the value of the orders he received in Montreal, via the Mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union of Montreal, for which mayor Gerald Tremblay was nominated.
After 2000, Zambito was generous to all parties and devoted more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68,000) to provincial parties, especially to liberals who were then in power.
He also admitted that he had organised an illegal search for finance for former liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Orders with money managers whose prices exceeded
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described her very carefully before the commission: during ten years he received a gift from construction companies, an invitation to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and a total of $736 000 in exchange for orders with money managers at which he oversaw the price.
Other public transport operators acknowledged that they had allowed themselves to pay off the remuneration for over-invoicing by 30% to 40% by means of false multiplication.
The mayor's organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye of turning his eyes on the current budget, which brought dirty money into his treasury.
On the basis of these findings, Tremblay withdrew early in November, putting Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district on the east of the island, since 2010, it has been targeting the sale of the current land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters directly in the middle of the flourishing real estate trade.
70% of the dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be initiated, says that "it attracts a thread in an attempt to understand the functioning of the system of promoted ants to stop gangrene and trap the culprits".
According to her, the process is "sick, but positive."
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but it is necessary to establish a separate investigation unit in Montreal and ensure that these questionable practices cannot be returned.
It's like she's cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public figures have cut hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly afraid of the role of "messengers informed of this figure", if they have not washed up!
It estimates that 70% of the funding for election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and with irony it adds: "I have heard that it is only a weak courage of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100, but according to it, it does not resolve the situation: "Unless the election costs are strictly limited, the dirty money will not go away from politics."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We can no longer decline; if we are bravely focusing on the substance of things, we can rebuild on a more solid basis and with greater control and enforcement of laws."
If this story has obscured the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that everyone laugh at him to look at their own palace...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you and PSG had a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by all individuals going to themselves, or by a completely new dimension of the PSG.
The big players came to us.
I get next to them every day.
The technical team has helped me a lot, too.
Every day these realities allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier to fight.
Everything's going so fast in football.
I don't lose my head.
From my beginnings in the preparation of INF Clairefontaine until after my transition to Saint-Etienne, I have always considered myself a single degree.
So you're using the competitive environment that led Carlo Ancelotti...
The positions of this year are usually playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every coach is essential.
And it turns out that a player like me then has a greater taste for racing and wants to give maximum performance.
Besides, Carlo Anceloti is giving me a lot in relation to my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makele who played in the same position as me.
Does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all techniques.
Today, he is not equal in the first league and is one of the best European coaches.
He's got a lot of experience and he's got a lot of titles with the top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he'll win another title in Paris.
In January, I graduated from a calming conversation with him.
I had a number of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How are you looking at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took our lead.
But we're staying in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the League of Masters: very easy to get into the eighth.
What's your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a tough rival for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualification team in front of Port so that we can play in the eight-millenium wedding at home.
Can the PSG stand in a short-term horizon with a large European club?
That's what the budget is for.
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and join history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, the PSG has the means to achieve this objective.
And would it be a big failure not to win the 1st league as in the last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to win a league.
We've been missing enough in the last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
It usually pays that with 79 points you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think it's gonna go away this year.
Even though large teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are trying to get a title, I think we have weapons available to defeat them.
You think the PSG media is expecting too much?
It is not unusual to expect from us much because of what has been invested here and what players we have.
That's what we totally accept.
It's a fact that if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something in our papers that's still going on, it's not really nice.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Of course, it's not going to win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set a game style.
You need time to build a team.
We've proved that we can play in the League of Masters.
Look at Manchester City, which wasn't trying for the eighth season anymore, and they also invested big amounts!
In view of the investments it would be possible to expect that you will have 15 points ahead!
You're insulting the other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille clubs, which failed too much last season, moved to another phase with the new PSG.
That shows how amazing the 1st League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that despite all the difficulties we have managed to overcome.
It seems that the PSG in everything depends on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovice.
It's a good thing it's said there's a "dependence on the Golden."
This means that Ibrahimovich is very effective and that he gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here to prove he's a 1st League star.
Wherever he went, he proved to be a great player, the world star.
We respect people and players on our team.
And he respects the people around him.
What he's achieved is really exceptional.
This also led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also makes it possible for others to grow alongside him.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with French representation?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately for the injury, I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I've experienced it, and I've gotten out of it.
Today I can play a good match in the performance.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I went to represent.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to be exemplary.
How are you looking at Didier Deschamps' first month in front of the national team?
He's talking about the results.
We're in a good position at MS.
Coach picks tight, is close to players and can breathe for victory.
So was Laurent Blanc.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deshamps will bring our team to Brazil.
Is Remise (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid initial match?
This game has given us self-awareness.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I didn't have such a match for my career.

All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and costs for processing between recipients.
As it is often true in the context of these technologies, there is a clear political outlook here: the conviction that the current financial system based on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (although convertible to dollars, euro...), as well as a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which enables the exchange of files between two partners.
Thanks to 15 000 computers involved in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as means of payment.
The price of bitcoin first reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it fell to 2 dollars, today moving at the border of about ten dollars (the price overview is listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to world exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on the virtual finances that emerged in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful virtual money", "competition dollar and euro" and "the period of regular money".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money by being used as "credits" for the process in video game that a person gets or can buy (and lynches and swaps back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all networks are depositaries of ordinary accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user may choose another address for each payment that ensures anonymity.
The information file relating to this transaction is electronically signed with a dual key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the legality of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, it is further possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of regular accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is contained in the entry of this new transaction into this book.
It is carried out by solving the mathematical task assigned to computers, which the solver, such as a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is a phase of file cutting; i.e. transforming a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, just then "cut off."
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (very zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check its accuracy.
The transaction will then be displayed irrefutablely linked to the chain of all other transactions; any adjustment would be made to the print.
If the user wants to pay twice the same money very quickly (up to ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be left because each of them has different prints.
The computer that solves the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, these remunerations are regularly divided into two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but it can be divided into a hundred million, so the space for the margins here is...
The difficulty of the task is also increased by an increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
The websites that provide Bitcoin services have been attacked and the protected bitcoins have been removed.
"The customs office used does not deal with the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of washing dirty money through this anonymous service.
But this problem also pays for cash.
The important players like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizman Constitution in Israel recently analyzed the book of ordinary accounts and proved that almost 80% of the batcoins are not running.
In November there were "big discounts".
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which deals with turning bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent credit card (with real money) or wireless payment by phone, but uses Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and may remain anonymous.
The system is easily configured for traders where you do not need to install new terminals or software.
Just communicate an address that can be "photographed and identified" by phone, says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question the hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin takes place, it will take some time, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
In addition, the ECB's report provides for a re-evaluation of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
The French units left their responsibility area in Afghanistan (Capis and Suroba).
NATO and US entities should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The greatest harm has been inflicted on people in the Afghan countryside, which we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, have lost 88 slain soldiers, and all of them are wounded and frozen.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often are rurals who deny the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They only want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they were added to them by the jihadists, the Pakistani, the Arabs, the Uzbek, and the Tajiks.
Now they enjoy tolerance and frequent help from local rebels, but if the Western forces withdraw, their support will decrease.
The departure of the French units from the base of Nijrab, which I was following from the peaks of the mountains planted by mandolins thanks to French loans, took place in an orderly manner.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without an attack on air escorts.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul.
The conditions have changed significantly between 1994 and 1996 from their unstoppable procedure.
The cable was once empty, and the land was in the blood and fire as a result of the fights between different groups.
Their takeover of control over the country was then regarded as their kind of freedom, return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the diminution of these peasants, who completely controlled Al-Ká'ida, but their situation did not improve until our day.
Some Mujahedins, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban agree to keep women in a subordinate position.
In 2001 the main war fighters against the Soviet forces returned to power.
They became chafants, strengthened state land sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge American orders for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them were not even in the fight.
According to what I heard in the campaigns, people are looking for a government that won't make a thief.
A number of young people want to leave just as they leave those who have managed to use American generosity: the escape of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and associated ideology.
During the exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they met the modern world and its benefits impressed them.
About 65% of the population is 25 years of age; in Kabul, there are currently 5 million inhabitants, five of the total population.
There are full schools in the cities, there are girls and boys.
These young people will have to provide work, they no longer want to go back to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish shows that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand in her head be considered legitimate?
Some commanders of the battle against the Soviet army are already renewing provincial militias, which will be beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a country with a strong influence on local identity, should enjoy certain decentralisation measures according to the Western model, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so it came to the abolition of the Prime Minister's post, which had existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzáí does not want foreign controls, especially in the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s.
No industry has been able to rebuild, no overhaul is working, no basic wetting system has been fixed.
Everything is imported; nothing is made, but fruit and vegetables.
It's a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, it would be necessary for the government to control the infrastructure.
The news is that Afghanistan has vast ungoverned wealth.
And it only felt like the western states were here just to strengthen it.
Without the energy to process iron or copper on the site and without means of transporting raw materials across the mountains, no disturbance of growth can occur.
The Chinese have almost abandoned their work on Mes Aynak and have left the international archaeological teams (supported by the World Bank) to explore the vast Buddhist area to maintain the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day, it will also be necessary to restore normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of the imports and exports depend.
The departure of the French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of the usual types of assistance: girls and boys high school, French universities, French institutes, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative "to acquire the heart and soul" has been working on an inconvenient task to facilitate aid and military activities, within which the "civil-military steps" Ministry of Defence (Cimic) has been active, which was abolished in 2012, but has been achieved thanks to the countless French non-governmental organisations in the area of common interest and agricultural reconstruction in dozens of mountain villages.
These jobs, involving the number of local workers, helped to determine the rise: wetting, cold, drinking water, deforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of processing areas.
What kind of memory do we have after two billion euros of military expenditure?
Much smaller budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, which are often over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapis.
In order to free these farmers from the rise of foreign groups, they wish, according to their words, to achieve non-necessary civil assistance for their benefit, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Hard work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursí left for the next part of the poker game.
While Egypt remains in its history the most divided by the declaration of the constitution, which temporarily confers unlimited powers on it, it has decided to play a vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, irrespective of the opinion of all others, that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt the final text tomorrow.
A few weeks ago, the head of the State gave this meeting another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been added many times, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal agreements.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's fragmentation.
From the point of view of the opposition, the President remains in his "autocracy delirium", continues "to violate his word" and "toss his right".
However, its graduates ensure that it is a means of speeding up the constitutional and political crisis and speeding up the transitional process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
This is a very brief passage of time that will cause the Brotherhood to withdraw from the Egyptian text to explain the article after the article.
It is also a way for the President to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the protests are being rejected throughout the country.
As confirmed in the U.S. Times interview, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this rapidly organised vote puts the Egyptian people at the forefront of the ultimatum: "You shall approve my text, or I shall leave unlimited powers," which should otherwise end after the adoption of the new constitution.
And in this special air yesterday, 85 members of the said constitutional assembly with a large majority of the Islamics approved the text.
Most of the Liberals were missing in the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitution was declared, they knocked at the door, not having the opportunity to cast their opinions.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have taken their step.
In order to achieve satisfaction, 11 of the replacements were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
No wonder, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted out unanimously.
Commenting further on the fact that one of the inconsistencies that day revolved around... the hour of prayer when some members of the committee held that the hours in the sitting room were not properly arranged.
The text, which was voted on yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
The subject matter of general attention, Article 2, remains in line with the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped that it would replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would allow for more application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their good will and respect for the rest of the Egyptian society.
"Treaty," the liberals who see only a verbal problem in it.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They shall focus in particular on Article 220, which confers on the University of Al-Azhar the advisory role, in particular on questions of checking compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pommierov, it is disturbing because "people who are invited to express themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
It can watch the beginnings of the theocracy."
The concerns of the liberals are even more excited by the fact that the next principal of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there was no specific religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not part of it, but university workers, a number of them have studied in French schools," Alexis Blouet, who prepares work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, they agree that "there may be disagreements with regard to the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used therein are part of the religious dictionary.
There is in particular a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic Law, p.
And in the future, there may be a question about the extent to which civil courts are competent to express themselves."
Yesterday's approved text is very criticised, apart from religious sites, for the extended powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brotherhood insists that they have been severely restricted against the former regime.
Another controversial place: the authority of the armed forces.
In accordance with the wishes of the military representatives, the defence budget will not be verified by Parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
They will no longer be banned in military courts from dealing with civilians, as the association demanded in the protection of human rights.
These associations speak of their doubts in relation to the text which they consider to be against freedom.
The offence of slander is maintained and the infringement is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article deals with women's protection, highlighted by Heba Morayef from the Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to be on TV last night, the event is scheduled for this afternoon.
Then the Heads of State will manifest on Saturday.
In Israel there are waiting for Ukrainian tourists holy places, world dolls and sea from a saturated salt solution
The promised land combines the size of Bible truth, modern comfort, and insecurity of nature.
AaF identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
To Worship the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that all those who enter this "false" will fall into God’s mercy.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus' miracles: the turning of water into wine at a wedding, the walking by water, the calming of the storm, and the filling of nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
Here believers will go through the Way of Pain or the Way of Jesus the Cross (Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, it passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of God's grave on Mount Golgotha - to the place of circumcision, to the stones of anointing and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is a symbolic Christian kiss of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree from which the cross was built to Jesus ’ crucifixion was built.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Nazarite Wall, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, there are people of different recognition who leave records with wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Emboss Vertical Path
The fortress of Masada remained hidden from the enemy that Herod the Great had built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The building is located on the slopes in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who take care of the horocities can reach her with their own strength.
The others on this historic mountain will take out a rope.
And in the north of the country there is a famous ski resort Hermon, located at the altitude of 1600-2040 m, which enjoys the vast range of tourists in the winter months.
To this ski paradise, tourists travel from the foothill of the mountain by bus.
The total length of mountain hares is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, they lived supposedly on the top of the mountains of pagan gods.
Visit Unique Museum
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You won't be able to visit everyone during one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts or Dead Sea scrolls found in the caves of Judah and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth visiting.
In his exhibition are his wages widely represented impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha Museum of Spas, which presents to visitors several rooms of ancient Turkish spas with figures of spas and spas operators from that time.
There is a unique private Ralli museum in Caesarea where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There's no guides or funerals with souvenirs.
Admission is free and gifts are strictly refused.
The fifth museum - the burnt museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells of one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built on the memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You will enter inside - and you will feel in utter darkness.
The stars are shaking.
And they mention the names of the children of the Jews, and the names of the lands wherein they were killed.
Ukraine is also listed.
Improving Your Health
The three main spa centers of Israel are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphins and oceans.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea, bathing can take place during the winter months because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and it has people bathing all year round.
The Dead Sea is, by the way, the most unique sea in the world, located at the lowest ground point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
Blue water is a saturated salt solution that easily maintains the level of water and persons who are not allowed to swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Get used here to be treated using salt water - solant, and a medical bath that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, inflammation of the tubes, diabetes to cure the nerves.
Touch the Secrets of the Past
It is protected by the old part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
They were accompanied by famous voyages of the sea, including Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The references to this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved a beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life together.
In fact, tourists love so many beautiful streets named after the signs of the beast.
It's said that if you press on the walls in the street of "your" sign, you'll be fortunately attracted.
In Jaffa you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to let them take pictures.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can go through the Roman theater and "get" the strength of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital city of Judea and the home of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate Pontius Pilate.
Carefully reconstructed theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, by word
If you're going to Israel, you don't have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the Russian population speaks.
On the road it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for cheques (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 cheques).
City transport is mainly bus services, but in Jerusalem a speed tram rides, and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city to the upper.
It's basically a underground wireway.
Traveling by all types of city public transport is worth 6 checkles, for which you can drive 1.5 hours with a seat.
In Israel the Sabbath is celebrated according to Jewish tradition.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, we stop working on the markets, in shops and in public transport.
And Sunday morning starts a week's work.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get a basket of food: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish without mushrooms and food containing a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a wide selection of lamb and beef meat, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish cheese hummus, the most varied kinds of sauces, pears from the milled cise - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no bulldogs on the streets of the cities of Israel.
That's why there's a lot of fed cats here who gracefully "tossed according to their taste."
In the evening hours you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Passing cats love cool places and tastes good.
The car will be loaned from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 per day (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And to borrow the bike will be around 15 checkles a day.
The entrances to the museum are 30 shekels on average.
Statement of numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To get to know the country and to rest came the most citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The country's promised visit from January to October 2012 to 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the expiry of the visit on 9 February 2011.
"Great and powerful" announcement to Moscow: immigrants save their money in language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language tests, fraudsters who sell "fell" certificates have already appeared in the country
There are 13 million foreign workers coming to Moscow, Petrograd and other Russian cities every year.
Most of them are Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law entered into force, under which every migrant worker must test the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail.
However, FMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, tests will consist not only of language knowledge, but also of Russian history and the principles of law.
The knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Tomuto is not subject to the law, nor are people who have successfully succeeded in obtaining a certificate and obtaining an academic degree in the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Use, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the protection of Puškov's Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship among Nations, the Moscow State University, the State University in St. Petersburg and other Russian high schools.
Migrants can run tests in all cities; now more than 160 such centres are open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of the testing was also supported by the members of the State party and the FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to question many times: what does it actually bring?
What changes the obligation to know the language for the Russians and the visitors themselves?
So, above all, - according to the migration service representatives - it will allow to reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "child labour."
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains FMS Russia's presidency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before they leave.
Only an organised set system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems arise in immigrants without a call, without education who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says with the conviction of Sebelev - the future migrant is condemned to encounters with unfaithful people, who will provide him with a "instruction" in terrible, close dwellings, where he and dozens of others, such as himself, will spend months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their power they promise one thing, but when they arrive, they will be deceived, entertain their passports, pay no promised wages," confirms the head of the Tajik Head of Labour Migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't give up!
The less many Central Asian citizens who intend to work in Russia admit that they do not only know the language of the country they want to get into, but have no experience even with the work.
Of course it's not their fault, as much as it is the accident: only very few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tadzians can afford to obtain at least adequate basic education.
In fact, their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need proper clothing, care, and equipment at school.
As children grow up to productive age, they must be prepared for work on the first occasion.
Without knowledge of the language, it's hard - they admit.
"You feel humiliation and humiliation."
It is true that in view of the language test law, human rights defenders point to one important matter.
Only those migrants who have legal status will be tested.
If they don't have it, they won't run tests or get any other official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live as illegally as they did in Russia before.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized entry is forbidden"
Many of the incoming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
Legalization is also worth money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The Russian police officers know that we basically have false documents, without registration, and these are the cases of extortion.
"They require a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," he divided with journalists about his experience with the citizens of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be hungry, buy your painting"
On the first day of validity of the Language Act, it was found that there were not only documents of migrants for registration.
FMS employees have already had a number of false certificates on language examination.
The forged documents are printed on a standard colour printer.
Of course, new owners did not get free of charge: each of the migrants hoped that this would ease the problem of testing, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times the amount higher than the completion of the official test: it will become migrant workers of three thousand rubles.
The main task of the immediate future is to ensure a system against corruption so that workers cannot easily buy documents, with government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Government authorities have so far been able to promise foreign workers who did not pass the tests for the first time, it takes time to complete the course of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not have Russians are expected to work in areas where there is no need for active contact with people.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not take part in an illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legally held weapons is very low
The Russian MVD proposes to strengthen the law with regard to the owners of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: there were incidents of shooting at marriages that were held without a victim, and a massacre prepared by Moscow's lawyer Dimitri Vinograd, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which a license can be obtained for carrying weapons - from 18 to 21.
This idea is supported by the head of the Security and Combating Corruption Committee of Irina Jarovaj, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be submitted to the State House in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of the path of "rubbering".
An open letter appeared on the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organisations - demand that the law be rejected as "unreasonable reinforcement".
The percentage of choliganism with registered weapons is minimal, Vasili Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminal in talks with the Russian BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 crimes were committed in six months 2012 using firearms registered in the Ministry of the Interior, while 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the strengthening of the legislation in the field of civil weapons is not acceptable to the contractors in order to move to the "black" market.
According to their words, there is currently a low-cost voluntary weapon in Moscow.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races by officers
"Black" market with weapons is stocked with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages that accept arms orders
The first of them - "military or military journey" means a weapon that was cut off during the battles at the Caucasus.
"The weapons were also stolen by Russian officials and the kacassans themselves," Baraněc says.
Other types of "black weapons" are stolen criminals from security forces.
The Baranec explains that there are also thefts from police funds and weapons stolen directly from the employees of criminal authorities.
The illegal "mainly" is obtained for sale from military stocks.
In many military warehouses there are often explosions.
"It has been proved that some fires have been deliberately founded - to cover the gap," said the former soldier.
According to the words of Barance and the arms manufacturers, they make their contribution.
"At present there are private arms companies that are not competitive on the international market, and they exclude weapons that they supply to the black market, including Moscow," said this expert.
Another source of the "black" market is paddling.
Especially a large number of guns and machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in painting, and there was a mafia who organized their gas production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have calculated what is the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this problem was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for the Analysis of Problems and the Design of Public Administration.
The experts reviewed the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office's records, criminal literature and public data portals focused on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers say, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons felt on the black market "the fault of official factors whose work is linked to weapons," the report says.
According to data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, 14% of them have been stolen during their production, and 5% are "black archaeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the arms stores that asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the digs of black "archeology" are not purchased long ago - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, the seller is driving for new shipments directly into military warehouses.
Through the facilitator, the interested person buys a unit, such as the TT gun.
You'll order a gun with him and he'll sell it to you across the fence.
"He takes her to the city and sells her there for 900 euros for a piece with two containers," he says.
"The truth is that the police are good in the picture, and therefore whenever they start to burn out a plan in the explanation of criminal acts, they will carry out a control purchase with illegal arms traders," the consultant says.
"As in a luxury store"
The sellers with the buyer most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until there was a guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Experience" platform where the man who would lead me to the "point" where we would act together.
The price was mostly found out when I was there.
Military rapporteur Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need a known person who knows the way out, a salesman - a consultant. - I have a known one, but I don't trust him completely.
The sellers on the market are, but there's also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to make sure my daughter got out of the tooth."
And now I'm going to get there through the man I'm sure of.
He also gives it to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Initiators are looking for different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was working on a stand to publish this subject.
The scheme did not change according to his words.
They gave him an album with photographs where it was "everything you've ever thought about."
"I felt like a luxury store," recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to Baranèce, does not offer pickups in demand - you can try anything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - let's go with the salesman into the woods and we'll build a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the gun shoots well, we start acting," says the expert.
Refiller on sofa
The search engines will bring you to the "Vkontakt" website and groups where you are offered to buy the "for various purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertising title on the website "Buy a gun or a machine."
On these pages, users leave their notification and ask questions.
And sell the unflighted?
"Of course without a license," asks the user "Ivan" (the legislation is preserved).
"I'm buying TT.Moscow" -- it's a very strict requirement for "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently decided on a huge network of targeted websites, and those who want to buy military weapons can use a shovel.
People eat like hungry fish on the seabed and then get carbon on Siberia.
Military rapporteur and higher military leader Viktor Baraněc
I have heard about such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer shall make the payment through the ATM.
"In response to this, the seller sends a photo and a description of the instructions where the weapon is hidden," the press spokesman of the NGO "The Right to Weapons" Dmitrij Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing an order on the website you can stay free of weapons and feel at home.

100-dollar Makarov
When buying illegal firearms, you will normally pay from $100 to $900, according to experts.
According to Dmitrie Kislov, from the NGO "Right to Arms", you will arrange Makarov's gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
The weapon shall be dispatched from long-term storage funds through the funds of the Central Article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia fell by 7% in October 2011 compared to the period of January 2011 and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of reported cases of theft and extermination of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, employees of fast food and supermarkets
Work on highly operational "McDonald" will go through up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart's hypermarkets and fast-cleaning restaurants such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Vendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will be turned into wave nine or will be judged to disappear soon.
All of these actions are supported by committees and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the increase in modest salaries received by a number of Walmart workers and in fast-cleaning systems, the aim of protest organisers is to achieve in them the creation of their trade union organisations.
At present, this economic sector is virtually unaffected by the expertise.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called "black Friday", when the Orgy of cheap sales hit America, captured millions of residents, and in some cases were accompanied by fighters.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, in which 2.2 million people around the world are working, have left their jobs and have demonstrated together with the committees and left-wing activists of multinational companies of commercial chains whose goods are destined for people of the lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything all over the world, from the lungs through hunting rifles and car batteries to the dryer, eggs and milk.
Products in its sales are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many employees with low wages at Walmart's stores only buy themselves at work.
Availability and range of goods have been made from the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart may allow itself to sell goods so cheaply because he only pays little to his employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as lack of automatic vehicles or hand scanners.
The demonstrators demanded an increase in salaries on "black Friday" and complained that the health insurance costs provided by the companies increased from $30 to $100 a month.
Typical worker Walmart gets $9.5 an hour, but it doesn't correspond to the amount of expenditure, the employees say.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley report that if Walmart increases the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it will cost $3.2 billion a year.
It's an average of 1.1% more than this company is paying now.
If Walmart moves the wage increase fully to the consumer’s shoulder, each visit in the sale will be only 46 cents more.
In a year like this, customers will lose about $12,39 more than today.
Walmart's defences point out that protests have only taken place in nine countries and that society should not cause virtually any damage.
"Black Friday" in the company's sales lasted from 8 hours on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, her deposits were made on "black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
Dan Fogelman, a representative of Dan Fogelman, said in his interview for the left-wing Huffington Post website that the jobs had left "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all "more media sensation" organized by the committees.
"Unencumbered treasure!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they did not aim at Walmart's commercial houses (they are not too in shape in that advanced city, and therefore are not nearly here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of pigs and then doesn't pay you sick and doesn't pay you well for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, City Council member in New York City
At present, the minimum wage for work is $7.25 per hour in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the state of New York.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wage, but only slightly, and on average, they get their regular employees in New York at $8.90 an hour.
No one in this precious city has a lower salary.
I don't understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
"McDonald" employs almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the school desk on part-time and live with their parents.
Only a few people look into it or plan to stay there long.
I'm still meeting with McDonald employees, who complain that they have to live with this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand na forum Wall Street Journal visí commentř, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonalda" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the treasurers and chefs in fast-cleaning establishments start to get at least $15 an hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of a committee organisation in the area of rapid treatment.
American laws prohibit the administration from preventing the establishment of trade union organisations and the punishment of trade union activists by harassment and release.
On the other hand, their administration often makes life easier for them.
However, it is also difficult to establish in the fast-cleaning industries of the organisation for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Inconsistency
This day there were noisy protests in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The performance of this event was at the "McDonald" meeting on Monday near Times Square, where several local democratic policies emerged, especially a member of the city council Jumaane Williams, who said "McDonald" says he sells billions of pigs and then doesn't pay you sick and does not pay you properly for your honorable work!"
The demonstrators also welcomed other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayor of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we need to work together to support fastfood workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity, which every New Yorker deserves!"
As New York Times described it, it was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the American sphere of rapid purification.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, although not all of them were fast - food workers who employ tens of thousands in New York.
Whether this event will become a bright light that will light the flames of mass motion is still unclear.
"The brain can be deceived on average"
Among the fans of modern virtual technologies is the popular theme of expanded reality; lately it means to perceive the world especially across the borders of special glasses.
At the beginning of the year at its annual conference, Google presented the working model of this news and in November it was announced that the application for the relevant patent was also submitted by Microsoft.
In consultation with the leading group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadim, it turns out that glasses are already in the past for this company's scientists.
Láká is a perspective of handling virtual objects in the air with empty hands, the creation of virtual public spaces.
- Tell us, please, what's your research team doing?
We're dealing with the interaction of a person with machines, but at the same time we're trying to move the boundary of this interaction.
So far, humanity's been stuck in the process of working with pixels on flat screens, most of the time it touches the finger screen.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect recorders - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is on sale without Kinect recorders, because for everyone there is a very interesting possibility to handle using gestures.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Although the Kinect system has transmitted interaction to the physical level, a lot of interaction is still going on on flat screens, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow has improved (the system accepts more data) but the output flow has not yet been particularly significant.
We are trying to change this, we are working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including design.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in much more appropriate form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid helms virtual reality!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it appreciated?
- Of course you can't consider him an exception - there is a question of privacy, because we don't always want to inform others in our environment about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but in their own environment.
For example, in order to control the facilities in public places, we had a project in which we were thinking about gestures, but not about blurry, just about such clusters, short.
The gesture, however, would not be seen by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far he's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the bracelet clocks.
Generally, however, it is true that the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
How, for example, would you ask me to give you this lemonade bottle?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at the moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's mutual intimacy.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that will be able to more accurately detect human reactions.
It can be, for example, laser sensors that provide relatively good deep resolution, which is very important.
- Should you talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution today, deep or anything else?
- Actually, the present generation - that's what we can reflect on our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about megapixels itself, it's about math and depth.
At the present time, all the current technology is not enough for us - it adds work to the designers of algorithms.
So we need to remember not only the resolution in X and Y axes, but also Z.
So it's also very important to speed, number of images per second.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flows 30 images per second are frankly little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch-screen with adjustable delay of processing in length from 1 to 100 ms, while the current serially manufactured sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects a person's interaction with a machine.
For me, work would be a very useful equivalent to such a device, but I don't need that much touch, but I need some pictures in a second.
- And there's no need to raise the number of cameras?
- The Kinect system now uses three "camera", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - the receiver of the reflected signal.
And now the third camera -- it's actually a normal visual tape recorder.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with curved location of the cameras and see how it will help when determining a three-dimensional position.
- If I remember well, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) didn't present his glasses in public.
Don't you think that when it comes to the daily use of technology expanded reality using special glasses, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and still holding the smartphone in the raised hand is not very comfortable, but I think: the most powerful variant would be a "transport" form of expansion of reality when it was possible to switch from the cloud platform at any time from the glasses to the smartphone, the projection display and beyond.
Bryce - it's a very personal device, it's their strength (only you see private things) and at the same time weakness - extended reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
How does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that expanded reality - it's the seventh thing that goes through in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of the humid perceptions could easily become an eight-way breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks - the use of the other hand as a particular type of image base is being used.
It's an excellent way to record pressure!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding to these "images in the air" - for example, interference with several directional ultrasonic punctures in the defined point, where the finger is, causes a feeling of matter, but it's still very weak - as if you were staring at the tip of your fingers.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects nerve marriage in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- You've been trying to fool your brain?
To think he feels what he seems to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to accept a person who is physically in a very tight space to believe that he is walking with an open, practically endless space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all such as clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
If brain failure becomes a target, work is still for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are at the very beginning.
Vkusovština instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the project "Petrohradská avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are in charge, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list, there have already been important characters of the Petrograd stage, whose achievements exceed the city framework, often find recognition in Europe without reaching the full approval.
The new hero "Rosbalt" is the amazing artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a vassate man who is all dressed up in the red, which you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashionable hospitals and on paint.
The pictures of Cyril Miller, where they are displayed, always attract the gifts of the spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical petrogradists, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is the imaginary man of the Petrograd vanguard at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets provokes smiles on the faces of citizens, increases everyone’s mood.
He recently took the bottle into his hand and became a petrogrid bottlemaker because he had grown up to this complex role with his entire goddom life, philosophy, and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking all over the city in red and not in yellow or, for example, in Turkish?
- I picked a red color as a designer dealing with the view and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between artist, imagemaker and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything that is slightly different from gray is aggressive and arouses bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on having a conversation.
The entire history of my provocative acts is, above all, an invitation to discussion.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevska, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my way is.
At that time, I could not understand the wave of old free informal artists and the new, free types of artists.
I was friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gazonevists who brought us to Puškinsky 10 and there were no other waves.
It suits me to watch, dress, music, in all genres except words.
- And it all came together in your art clinic... - It was important for me to feel at the center of Petérburk culture, where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995, I planted a place on Puškinska 10, and there was still a musical-art club, a Bohemian club, a home of the caverns.
There were many:NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Schnura brought with the project "Echo Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang under the shin of a light song, dressed in handy t-shirts, among them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachténberg, thus starting his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboyedov - this is the sound of Art Clinic.
This is where our workers left and our guests stay.
I'm a hero of the past century when culture meant something else.
In 2000, the research was organized in print, the special price was "People in Our City".
In the nominee of "The Artist of the Year," I was named, thus ending my peak.
In new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, sincerity and culture of the past century.
In recent years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristicly recognizable.
- Many of my images - these are hits in which the current and ingenuity is captured alive.
I'll have a program show "Russian Museum in Clowns".
The clowns are overtime.
I used to be social, being such is painful and terrible today.
But in the clowns, everything's under control. Tragic.
I love grotesque, I love grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world by means of total conversion in the order of alignment.
Today, people meet according to their clothes, focus on external mechanics, not on the inner person.
Or maybe you can't give him your hand, and he needs to swim in his face.
And the lie will be removed by dressing.
- We've seen you recently as a city bottler. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should it be if I didn't?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There's a cultural breakdown.
People used to meet in jokes, God loved one, just other people.
Today it's all broken into micro-society, and today it's very hard to like everyone.
I'm not a stadular banker to like everyone.
Today we need to think about who you like.
Today every cultural hero has his 100 fans.
- And a few thousand spectators are coming to St. Michael's!
- He's got fans. He's got a sexual social sphere.
And there will be 300 people on the cultural soil, and 10,000 will not come, and as a result there will be less management, money, everything will be cold.
I've got fans, the main thing is that no one's gonna let them down and break what they're up to.
When I was young, I painted pictures of one collector hanging on a wall with Falke and Lario.
I started with images that most people end up with.
Today, people often get confused.
They say:Culture spiritual, culture consumer.
There's no culture of consumerism, that's disgusting.
I was a man of culture yesterday, I grew up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who refused money for drawing images.
And I'm for that kind of culture.
- Cyril, what's missing in Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: an agent through culture.
Not every one of them can take care of their culture.
At the time of the proper emperors, it was not so in all, the emperors may not have understood the culture too much, but they understood that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in Petrograd who might be experts, but they're trapped somewhere in the corner, because there's a need for big experts who properly assess these experts and guide them on the right path.
Today, taste is flourishing.
Tataj Erarta, but it is different by sincerely saying that we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should be looking for another museum.
- What do you think of Peterburk?
- Peterburk - it's not the main city of culture, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's the right ground.
And on our top, art is being done poorly.
We need cultural land, but we have more writers today than readers, that's wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to shows, concerts.
We only have a layer like this.
We need art to become fashionable things, as it was in the early century.
The project is implemented through the St.Peterburk grant
Rodit in Space
The country's in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with landowners on board are released on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, the main question arises: How can you keep your family free or on a particular surrogate planet?
I don't think it's a big choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be won, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a highly established scientific worker of the State Astronomical Institute P. K. Sternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus, temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius.
It's only possible to live there at high altitudes or at Venus orbits... in space.
The question of reproduction in the universe has been solved by scientists with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of games grown on the surrounding route are nothing different from their earthly relatives.
Then we carried out the removal of moisture into the orbit - very small fruit males of Drosophila.
In 1979, there was an extraterrestrial egg sent to the universe to check how the embryo develops in a state of weightless gravity.
We get an absolutely normal bird on the exit.
But then problems start.
"There is a problem with this bird having to find resistance, it has to go on its own feet and start moving," says the head laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they don't find resistance, the birds are chaotic and they're making cobblestones.
After 10 hours, freshly hatched birds came to a complete loss of instincts.
The birds didn't respond to the light or the sound.
And the problem was they just died within four days.
"Two times we let birds fly, but then we refused it because it is simply impossible to work with them," comments the failure of the experiment with chickens in the space Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniarcha" was flying on a round track 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but they'll only be the beings of one sex.
He's been experimenting with encounters that were being broadcast into space already pregnant.
In fact, they didn't reveal anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatellite, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts need to be carried out," Vladimir Sychev says.
After landing on the earth, a offspring was born to the cosmic rats.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of multiplication directly into space.
It's a tough task.
In the event of the loss of a normal environment, animals simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
A man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens is governed by abstract thinking and is able to create the right emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The Tereskovs were threatened by the greatest danger.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Teaca flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it's going to fly into space.
If he can have a baby after such a year.
"No one has answered this question yet," says the veteran of the Wachtang Wakkandze rocket-space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight to space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Téreskov's daughter was born.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut Andrian Nikolai.
In 1988, the son of the second female cosmonaut was born Svetlana Savicke, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in the open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts that have been born after many years and are growing in the health of our offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital years," says the cosmonaut-pilot, the Soviet Union's Hrdin and Russian Valerij Poljakov.
Mankind must, however, inevitably look for new ways in the fields of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaborator is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in terms of zero attraction, the cosmonauts acquire the habits needed to work in an open space.
Water imitates the state of ease.
Although for adults, water is comfortable, but in its strange way, for young children it is natural.
Little hunters seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a relationship between having a child on average for 9 months in the mother’s fertile water and having a better habit of watering.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the time of the first bath, it will only take two weeks.
"It's very little for the child to forget something," says the Newborn swim instructor Marina Aksenov.
In fact, if for a newborn child there is a condition without a natural condition, then for women there is more natural inevitable gravity, attractive force.
In a state of weightlessness, there is a rapid rise in the bleeding of the abdominal muscles, in the muscles of the joints, in the body’s ability to emit fruit.
We can leave that aside if the muscle stimulators work when they're born.
Finally, it is possible to have a baby in a special chamber where the mother’s organism emits fruit.
"And what's next?" Valerie Poljakov asks complicated questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism is not affected by low attractiveness, it cannot properly shape the bone or muscle system.
Newborns on the circular track are not possible as adults in special clothing with a load in which they could train.
He'll just get rid of what he needs for his development.
"If we go with you into an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a healthy person on Earth who will be completely unadapted to this environment," the head of the IBMP RAN Igor Pestov bioethics commission.
So the birth of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
One day, however, the time will come when the earth will become a reality and the earth will be spent in its shell on a distant planet that will become the home of their offspring born into the universe.
Head of NKU: Control of the fraud system has failed to blame politicians
In relation to public procurement, the Czech Republic has a good controller and quality legislation, but it is failing in its application.
In the interview for Current.cz, this is said by the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office of Miloslav Kal.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what we think is missing," says Kala's current situation.
Similar conclusions also indicate joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter rarely has access to the so-called "swarcsystem".
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the ODS will not bother the business with its controls - is it prohibited or permitted?
"The law must be somewhat established, and if it prohibits something, it cannot prevent the president of the government from carrying out the office that is obliged to control and enforce obligations," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Ambassadors, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What was that about?
It's a parallel check we started about two years ago.
It is simply said that European legislation regulates how public procurement is handled, followed by individual national legislation and then by the same practice.
We have put all of this together, and even though the control has not yet been completed, we have shown very interesting differences - generally referred to as legislation is also possible for us "more attractive and better", however, the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to continue to create more precise rules, but it is necessary to commit to the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually do for you, what's it gonna do for you?
This is exactly what joint control could contribute to stop us from making efforts to simplify laws, reduce and improve limits, if it does not have such a positive effect.
Economy means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to exclude enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal conduct.
But by reducing the limit of the orders, we don't have to make it.
Maybe the system pays so much "paper" that those who want to find holes in the system will get a lot easier out of it than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about foreign problems with the transposition of public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our NKU, or is it set up differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, as the NKU operates there, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised as we are, also has a college, it is only a little different, but in principle both authorities are doing the same.
The powers are to some extent similar, however, because Germany has a community arrangement, so these courts also have an accounting system at the level of individual community countries - in which this system differs from ours.
The BRH can control only community money, represented by state funds.
Public media, which are managed by countries and foreigners, are controlled from the level of community accounts.
What about darker legislation, so it's simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, but in some respects Germany is designated as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it is better at all.
So it's also because they have better controllers?
I'm sure not, but I'm telling you again, I don't like this comparison.
But we have to say that even the countries that we consider to be a model are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise, there would be no benefit for them to cooperate with our office, would there?
What about foreign legislation, which meant new public procurement laws for your office, is its impact?
Since the period of validity of this novel is relatively short, it is not yet in our control actions.
Because we're doing ex-post checks, we need to count with a certain delay.
So far, we have seen this only in the process of preparing future controls - we have started our new tool "to detect risks of inefficiency", through which we have detected nearly 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - there will be changes of course, because the limits, the conditions of some types of selection are being adjusted and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law to be more of a benefit or a further burden on the red tape system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can happen here is that she's got the "stupid" rules and won't be possible to keep them.
For the purposes of the previous rules, persons under control are already bound by the supplier (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the public procurement law entails a breach of the budget.
So does the law have the value to do with this?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, not punish those who will allow formal doubt that does not affect decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater red tape pressure.
So how do you get out of it?
Let's see where the road's not going.
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not make it difficult for businessmen to control the so-called "swarcsystem" - and what does that mean?
Is the system prohibited or allowed?
However, the law must be somewhat set up, and if it prohibits something, neither the President of the government shall prevent the exercise of the authority which is obliged to exercise control and impose obligations.
He can say, "We'll change the law and let it go," but he can't say we'll do it like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act there are relatively strict rules as to what is formally to be done - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what we think is wrong.
Roads are places of hardened but mostly starry
Several places in the Czech Republic are paved and snowy roads.
Most of them, though, are passenger cars, somewhere with increased caution.
Nationality of Karlovara
In the state of Karlovars, this morning the roads were steep, but steep, and snowy.
The temperature decreased between five and ten degrees below zero, but should be slightly warmed during the day.
Snowing in the region has risen and lows have only a weak layer.
However, on the ridges of the Crusades there is about 30 centimeters of snow.
The sites were even lower visibility due to mud, resulting from data from the dispatch of regional highways.
The R6 motorways and first-class communication are now unrestricted in the region.
However, caution is in place, for example, at some crossings where the surface may be narrow and slippery.
The stars are also all roads of the second and third classes, including mountain roads.
However, in some areas there are still the remains of frozen snow and a place of caught snow.
Above all, there is a need to pay more attention to driving in higher positions.
Pardubic and Queen's Land
On some roads in the eastern Czech Republic, there is a threat of freezing, in higher positions and on the mountains there may be a layer of snow on the communications, it informs the Directorate of Roads and Roads on its pages.
Motorists protect drivers from freezing, can be formed especially in the higher positions of the Pardubic country.
It can be found around Lanškrona, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitav or High Myth, and especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemicals are treated on roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlic Mountains.
The catchy snow layer is in the highest positions on roads in the periods of Rychnov nad Kněžno and Trutnov.
In eastern Czechs today, it is most often clear to the plain without any strikes.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Celsia, a weak wind blows.
Plzeňý Country
The roads in the Plzeňsk region are in the morning, but places with increased care and driving need to be adapted to the weather.
It's cold after the morning, temperatures move between three and nine degrees below the ice point.
After previous snowing and subsequent cooling, some communications may be infrequent.
The positions must also be counted by the driver with the fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
It comes from information from a range of national road drivers.
The D5 distance is almost unrestricted, but increased caution is recommended by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plzeň and Tachovsk, there may be sharp cuts.
Communication of the second and third classes shall be wet and in this case alerts shall be given.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent routes in the area of Shumava.
Olympia
With the snow checkout on the road today they have to count drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouk region.
After a chemical examination, she stayed on the Red Mountain saddle and on the road towards the Videlsk Cross.
On the night of snowfall, motorists in the area avoided, according to road managers, about three inches [3 cm].
In other parts of the country, most passenger cars are unrestricted.
"Sumperska is located in the highest snowfall.
With the snow box on the Red Mountain saddle, drivers must count towards Jeseník," the ship's traffic controller said today.
Their colleagues at Jesenicka went to the field at night, and the roads to the highest places are now according to them after the chemical treatment is bare and wet.
On Olomouck there are boundless roads, but on Šternbersk drivers should pay attention in forest sections where the vehicles remained wet.
Country of birth, Liberian
Right after the morning, several difficult landings are reported by the road driver in northern Czech Republic.
In addition to several snow or ice spots, a mountain road from Telnice na Knínica na Ústecka is also closed from the police database.
Temperatures are kept below zero, so ice and snow are probably on the roads.In the lows, especially in the south-east of the Czech Central, but there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
Traffic complications have not yet been reported.
The appearance of glaciers is reported by motorists, especially in the area of Szćti.
According to meteorologists, it was ideal for her at night - over the day of rain and rolling snow, in the night clear and cold.
From the main points of view, adverse conditions are also reported on road I/13 on the border between the Ústek and Liberia.
The castle from Telnice to Kninice was opened by the bent branches of the trees, which, under the snow, pushed up to the vehicle.
Šimon Ornest: At concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think is going to happen to the end of the world in a few months?
It's just one of the other scary news that we people like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap we make more fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to make the end of the world or prevent it.
In addition, in December you will organize a fully united project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers closer?
It's a state-owned benefit action we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
On 20 December, from 21 hours ago, 3 concerts will be held in Prague, Brno and Ostravo.
They will end about the time when the Mayan calendar will end in the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in the 12 hour time zone before us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally, it was probably my idea, and then we thought it over with our artist, Honzo August.
In addition to our desire to gather enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about how much this world we once pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of items of boots, shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world that people can also support by buying at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap team along with other interpreters also sang a so-called hymn against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Cancelled".
She's very popular on YouTube today, she's also singing these charity concerts?
Of course, and in full conclusion, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn't happen...
It's sung by all the players at all three concerts at the same time.
The Hymnas are also all of a sudden connected in a unique direct broadcast on Czech television.
He wrote the lyrics of this song and plays the main role of Jesus in the clip Tomáš Hanák, also singing Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of beneficial events and concerts...
We are trying to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are working with us interesting and fun.
What will be the challenge of concerts against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the free barrier education centre Studeo, which we have been carrying out for six years with the citizen association Tap in Jedlikkov.
For students of the Jedlikka Schools, teachers regularly come and engage in activities that are fun and interesting.
The students themselves don't have the means to give themselves up as lecturers, so we're trying to make it possible for them to do this.
Within the framework of the construction of the Jedlikka Institute in the future, there will be a separate building to move to.
There will be a number of musical groups and interpreters at each concert.
What did you pick them for?
We've been trying to build a program that tells all generations, including children.
For example, Chinese, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dana Bartou, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchy will play in Prague.
For more details, please contact www.kpks.cz.
You're planning a similar "bomb action" to the future?
In May we will be the first to take part in the Prague Spring, so here we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we'd also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we're in the United States, I'd like to connect it with a show in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalistic, so far you've been out in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of disabled people.
How do you manage these routes logistically and organizationally?
It's not as scary as it seems at first sight.
We have five members on the electric vehicle, its vehicles have to travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we are pulling a large amount of cargo and poor with tools...
However, it has always worked out without problems, ČSA and British Airways have been very ready for us for how many times I was amazed.
Even in Moscow, which we recently returned from, it was all right.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how individual differences are in barriers, public access to disabled people, and so on.
What have you been up to?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we have just witnessed in Russia that everything in the east is still in full swing.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is a very barrier, where it is still unusual for a person on an electric vehicle to move himself in the city centre.
It doesn't even apply the kind of self-esteem you might give the riders a preference in the elevator.
Fortunately, civil society is already under way, trying to alert people to the problems of poverty.
On the contrary, what do we still have to pursue a more prosperous country?
There's a lot of things we're still in...
However, it is important to mention that improvement and improvement are always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid it's quite common that even people with a heavy handicap move on their own to the public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not too common that a large number of people with disabilities would actively participate in social life, on the contrary, we are with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for the public or freedom of choice is one thing, but only when we are important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things are really going to change.
So far, these are the only cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap Chapel is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years what made you start it in 1998?
I went as a educator to Jedlik's constitution, where I had a lot of young people around me who were interested in something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I'm playing saxophone, so I started an interesting music ring with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our moderator Ládja Angelovich says, we got a little out of hand (Laughter).
But the popularity has come to the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we began to associate with well - known singers and also to work actively on promoting the band.
It turns out that work that is not visible is essentially as if it didn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to touch it with The Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something else.
The show business is filled with things where one resembles the other.
It's logical in its own way, everything new is taken care of and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, pity, it's natural...
But this pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings that we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with disabilities, it's not just a move for them, it's for the whole society.
Did this success also help you to be a tough boss, as many people have called you?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and require certain discipline.
But I think it's completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic imagination and head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go twice a week to try, get ready and spend a lot of time on the concerts, the excitement is quick.
This is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
At present the band The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many were at its beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people are leaving and coming, that's not to be stopped.
Who has will and taste, always has a door open to us
The day before the expected end of the world will take place on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
It will take place in Prague in the arena, Brno Flédé and Ostravo Plynojem for the participation of 12 chapels and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities are combined with a telemostor at the joint song of the band The Tap Tap "The End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the provision of the STUDEO Multifunctional Barrier-Free Education Centre at the Jedlikkov Institute in Prague of 25 million Kč
Admission to the concert is 400 Kč, children under 12 years of age have free admission to the Bohemiaicket pre-sale
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, Poland was adopted as a twentieth member of this European Space Agency, as a second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of Agency projects over the years.
However, Poland's journey to space began a long time ago.
For years, Polish enthusiasts were devoted to space before World War II, but they did not always meet with understanding.
I would remind you, for example, of the lecture A. Sternfeld in Warsaw's Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933 presented thoughts from his progressive work Enter into space.
The thoughts of the young engineer (nr. 1905) left the listeners cold and after years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
Sternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934 for the entry into cosmonautique in France.
The mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonautism.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote a series of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned propagandist of cosmonautics and his benefit was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the twisted side of the moon was named by his name.
Already in 1925, a railway drain was built in Poland, which was to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown and no details of the project are known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should have been used to break down the drain or to freeze it.
Information on this site is only known from time printing.
From 1933 onwards, the shooting of missiles began to take place in Poland.
The research provided the Arms Technology Cell in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
From stored materials, it is evident that research has grown into a stage of practical testing.
However, the arrival of the German army was interrupted.
In 1937, in the specialized press, a project of photoelectric collision missiles was published by the engineer Rohozinski and the following year the work of the rocket - air torpedo and rocket bomb by the author of Lelywy-Krzywoblock.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just prior to the war with all projects of military use of missile technology, the Scientific Advisory Committee (the Temporary Advisory Committee) coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, the war ended.
Another work of the cosmonautice is revealed after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Polish Astronautique Society).
For the first time, it is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the issue of Problem Magazine, where four more comprehensive articles are devoted to astronauts.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotwicze, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with space science.
At that time, the projects of artificial comrades were already under way and it was clear that space research was a prospective area.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautic Federation (based 1951) and has become a true member of the PTA in the autumn.
And in the following year, PTA First President Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
This function was suspended until its death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has played a significant role in the development of highly successful meteorological rockets RM (Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to be conducted by scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first started on 10 October 1958.
The 1,800-meter access rocket was about 80 cm long and its weight was only 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built and two-stage RM-2 rockets were launched in the Bledov Desert in 1959.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development should already have been able to do scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have access to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, further development was suspended in 1962.
As a consequence of the first RM-type rockets, the Meteor-1 rocket was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and its starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types have been developed (labelled Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) which vary in size for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket space was available with a volume of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 litres.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, he was at the Meteor-2 Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial mass of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is still necessary to mention Poland's entry into COSPAR in 1960 and the establishment of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
Poland was also involved in space exploration in the interkosmos programme in Soviet artistic associations, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remkov.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively debate among the public.
Of course, it will be interesting to look at the problem from a broader point of view.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free, without limit, movement of private capital together with sound financial speculation.
The effect of significant differences in the price of work (wage) results in price tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the position of the manufacturer when attempting to import cheap goods into economic competition by "stirring" the price of the competitor in order to increase its market share and thereby increase its own profits.
In the mass measure this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production to abroad, or to buy cheaply, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other high economies.
Since private capital does not have any social responsibility and thus also the responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditure of the State is necessarily increasing.
The whole situation makes it easier for businessmen to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused in the pursuit of profits.
The situation is so widely known that no specific statistical data should be provided.
Independent private capital practices create a situation in individual economies where the governments of each country are forced to enter into mutual competition with a view to reducing the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are giving private capital their own population regardless of social breakdown.
This is particularly evident in the amendments to the applicable laws.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the price of private capital, in particular in the area of wages.
However, this is done by the system of economic recovery in the event of long-term unemployment, but by restricting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is growing along with the growing differences between the poor and the rich.
There have been a number of years in the SRN public food outlets for the poor who cannot take advantage of their own work.
The number of these people is already going to be millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for rightly employed people to receive wages such that they must be paid to the existing minimum.
Such a scandal was also reported in the case of auxiliary employees in the community.
The controversial measures of practically all the EU southern states are undoubtedly leading to the same situation when people are forced to emigrate at a social level under the pressure of disaster, as it was in the 19th century, or to live for wages at the end of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually come to the country.
Where is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
If it is from other EU countries, poverty is moving from one country to another, or it is not going to come at all, because China, India, Brazil, either Turkey, Morocco, or Egypt, or Africans are still working for a break in European wages.
It's all about Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media to restrict claims that the State cannot take part capital in its own economy, that the managed economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital of the municipality is of the opinion that the State must not be involved in economic activities.
Then we need to ask ourselves whether private capital is not affected, it is now in fact driving politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
There's a clear answer here, yes.
Evidence is practically omnipotent and available lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation where virtually everything is punishable, but nothing punishable.
In the SRN, the situation is that state ministries for lack of financial resources are making proposals for legislation available to private legal firms that are lost in connection with industry.
These draft laws are then passed in Bundestag.
All too much comes not from people as the Western constitutions report, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberally oriented democracy is now rapidly getting into the situation, as Appianos describes it in his work of the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state has been in full disparity for a long time and the authorities have been obsessed with violence.
For bribery, illegal acquisition by kindly and by means of stones or swords.
The payout and corruption were without any ban and people went to elections with a pre-sale vote" ..."The character of people did not give up on the office at all, so once it had been the result of this revolution for eight months without consuls." . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The conclusion, as in the past, is based on an independent preference of its own, irrespective of the overall public interest.
Private capital is no longer in a position to understand and apply the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is now, as it was then, the unprecedented decadence of elite without any effort to reform a deeper race.
We must therefore look for the causality of the rise of fascist and communist regimes in the unprecedented liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
At the present time, the failure of these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain stop waiting for another round.
Especially disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring possible statistical losses in life, humanitarian and social disasters, which we are now witnessing together with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a lasting one.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at international and internal European level, the Czech Government will continue to be forced to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is the political and social reforms aimed at strengthening the State's participation in the economy, boosting the influence of citizens on the government and weakening the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing comes out of violence and can never come out of it" Sting in the song of Fragile whose main verse in the refreno is "let's not forget how we are sinners"
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be no dying" Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a lot of reactions arose.
One stands behind Israel, argues his right to self-defence, and Palestinians match the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue against the racism of the Israeli state, genocide in Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel fits into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is periodically in the recurrent waves of guilt killing and who is the victim, at the end of today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
This is what I want to offer our readers a view of the opium, a view of who has been serving above all 95 years of tension (calculated by the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on the small part of the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by the available historical facts some of them are driven by my own understanding of who a group of people is the main proponent of the events of modern history.
The actions of mankind are first of all the history of the struggle for power.
In every age, we can look for some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who were totally autonomously guided their steps and whether or not there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards the above-mentioned goal.
We must admit that we are living at a time when worldly wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the power derived from it could not come to life for one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is one that could be considered the head of the hospital (if someone is still standing above them I don't know, but I don't exclude it) - Rothschild.
It's not much about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) was already bought in the 1990s to stop the merger of its name with the high criminal effects in which they were standing and which always meant to strengthen their power, increase their wealth or both.
They have major shares in almost all of the world's central banks and against countries where the central bank shares do not lead or prepare wars (before the attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the defeat of Cadafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to oppose this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank of Rothschield Bank of America, began to issue his own money during the civil war (understanding government) and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the FED, was murdered in 1963, Ambassador Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for the resolution of the big economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of the plan of the three world wars with the highest cedar tree, the 33rd degree dedication of Albert Pike.
The first war was to remove large monarchy states in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule, in particular Great Britain, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world population of some 0.5-1 billion people (such a quantity of slaves for their conveniences and luxury is sufficient and does not need so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a prerequisite for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method used by the group of the richest families in front of Rothscheldy is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, so that the crisis does not repeat itself as the one that was triggered in 1907).
So after they succeeded in killing the Habsburg successor of the R-U throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo to break up the first world war, the Russian emperor was destroyed by the release of the Bolshevik Revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, in a military and economically unrelenting way, capitalizing Germany (there was no longer a need for a war to destroy the Russian Empire) and subsequently broke down the central European power, Austria.
For the sake of easier resolution of the second world war, politicians have allowed politicians to create a latency conflict situation by calling on Germany a huge war repair, creating the assumption of radicalization of the masses of losers, and then it was enough just to encourage the Germans to be strong enough, guilty and simple to offer the leader and further create a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to be frequented, and also multiplied, the function of the fifth column, in the wake of a warfire.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschild was promoted by the foundation of Zionist movement, which one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as the capital city (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration already mentioned created a pretext for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, which began to take place in the first clashes with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The second world war broke out, if Hitler was removed from the chain on which the international bankers initially held him, or anything he had done in the plan was difficult to estimate, then the suffering of European Jews in concentration created the basis for acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the war repairs made by Germany in World War II, a third war was set in motion by the declaration of the State of Israel.
If the international bankers are able to divorce it, the Jewish nation, as in the second, will be victims of the first line of battle, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of trouble and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (let us take only how sharp people are divided into supporters and supporters of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where the crime is the result of the infinity of violence when the poverty of individuals and their desire for global power began?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are urging people to vote solely their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister of Netanyahu is a typical example of the fascination with international bankers of loyalty, which is doing its utmost to break up the war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in Shanghai's Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to escalate into a global conflict and because Iran's control over the Hormuz Peninsula, which travels 20% of all world oil (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serve comfortable handfuls of financial aristocracy.
A world where every new born entity is implanted in the birth of a chip that makes it a totally controlled entity.
"And force all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that they can not buy or sell who is not marked on the name of the Shem or the number of its name.
It's important to understand who's got the sense to figure out the numbers of the spleen.
That number marks a person and it's six hundred and sixty-six."
Film Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, he held the duty of demonstrating Islamic students to an American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released as a replacement for the caste of Mohammed Réz Pahalvi, who, after the revolution, fled to the United States, who had been the sponsor of his regime for several decades.
For the U.S. administrative situation, she did not offer a positive approach - throwing chess across the board could not afford to be allowed because it would, in principle, compromise the trust of allies in other countries.
The release of hostages, however, in Iran, where the revolution ended in establishing a theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a morning for the prestige of the United States, which was later exacerbated by a failed attempt to free the armed forces.
After 444 days in prison, the diplomats were finally released after the negotiation was mediated by the Algerian government.
Their gift at home caused a wave of solidarity and anti-iron sentiment.
The debate in Iran made a significant contribution to the defeat of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film directed by the actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of this story that America has brought a small victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees fled.
After complicated perieptics, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them from Iran, but helped an extravagance cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film staff who saw the location in the country for filming a big film.
Combination of genres
A plan that made up an expert on "exfiltration" Tony Mendez also required Hollywood cooperation.
To make the legend credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, organized a press conference, a fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been hidden for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realisticly perceived political thriller, also called "caper movie", a story of a piece, a puzzle - could be an example of Danny's series.
This is how the events - on one side of the documentized sequence from Tehran (the title sequence shows the iconic time photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences in that).
On the other hand, the distant passes from Hollywood, combined with irony and a slight surprise.
And then there are scenes from the CIA and other institutions - men in the clothing are discussing the situation at the action tables, at the office's halls, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has been able to relaunch his career in a remarkable way.
He became a respected director and even his legacy ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third entire evening movie, after the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Afleck's video that doesn't take place in Boston's director.
Cit for the atmosphere of the place, however, was among the characteristics that the directors of the older films increased above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are played in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its transparency, which at the same time relieves the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when history is cleared somewhere.
The similar effect of Affleck and its collaborators is achieved in the stage of thought (false staff on the Tehran base).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story described does not actually offer much in the film sense of the stage.
It's not working well enough, sometimes it's actually thinking about something - everything doesn't work so elegantly out there anymore (the scene in which a dangerous crisis at the Tehran airport turns off calling in America and the scarf after the wound seems quite attracted to the hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the solution that comes from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in the roles of Hollywood collaborators very sharamant, but their characters would deserve more space and are not far away in this film.
Afflek's film thus loses a little dramatic touch, it's a picture that can be watched with a slight interest, evaluate the realization and retro style evocating the 70s.
But it's just hard.
As a reminder of one way or another of living history and the evidence of how exaggerated ideas about all powerful and all - knowing secret services are but enough.
Rules for flaking balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplaka.com, which makes an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, now decided to declare the competition "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
"It led us to the last event when the EU is planning to accept a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," said the Law organizer of the Patrick Naher survey.
Among the appointed absurdities, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
So far, women have been benefiting from life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by people by the end of this year.
The vote alone will then take place by the end of February 2013,” Naher said.
Amongstst the controversial EU Regulation, it is also necessary to incorporate bioconcentration into fuel, which is harmful to nature, further banning the use of reliable mercury temperatures simply because they contain a relatively small amount of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of blind cages, which has significantly affected the eggs this year.
Critics previously also faced a factual ban on the use of the expression of anointed butter or the removal of classical lamps from the sale.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters
The Union apparatus often decides under the pressure of the commercial or industrial lobby whose requirements in Brussels usually affect some state or group of states (the Czech Republic now promotes the requirements of its banks by threatening the veta).
Lobby loans were also due, for example, to the fact that bananas of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and not to show "anomalous bending".
The European Commission, however, opposed the harmonisation of today's disunity national standards that have complicated trade.
The EU standards on fruit and vegetables have already weakened the resistance of some countries, pointing out that the existing Directives lead to food spills.
The candidate for victory in the survey may also be an EU last year regulation which requires compulsory notice that children under 8 years of age should not be inflamed without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to American research, according to which balloons among toys are the leading cause of the death of children to be killed.
Similar restrictions are now applicable for children under 14 years of age when smoking in roadblocks.
Curious ideas are born at home
It is quite absurd, then, also the rule concerning the European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatka.com server, in cooperation with the Laissez Faire liberal economists association, nominated in a survey, in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities, the Union Regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has set the maximum quantities of food stocks that could be located in the territory of the PRC on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, certain volumes of preserved mushrooms, which threatened him with a high fever.
The survey organizers were also interested in paying some countries for having no sea, and the idea of granting grants on the application for a grant.
However, these ideas did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are disabled by having no sea.
We will ask the European Union for reimbursement," the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSSD) said in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he stated that we had a lot of grain born and that, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, there were full stocks that had to be exported.
For the Czech Republic to continue to port, the EU had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros according to the Palace.
Finally, the European Commission went out to the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant was offered by the Ministry of Local Development, managed by Minister Paul Germany (US-DEU), specifically to write down a request for a Brussels grant.
EU: Bisar regulations are an exception
However, in the Member States, the regulation easily becomes the target of criticism, EU efforts to regulate and at the same time to improve the functioning and development of the Union as a whole deserve greater recognition, according to a number of experts.
More serious is the problem, according to experts, for example, of drawing EU grants on projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which have benefited Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The emotion between the Czech Republic also provokes the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Union countries, must fight in Brussels for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products, and not always succeeds in this fight.
The Czechs, after fighting with the Germans and the Rakušanians after the sixties, saw the marking of the breakup shapes, but the foreign rum, whose tradition is in ours until the 19th century, had to be renamed by our producers as foreigners.
The name of the rum may consist only of products of trimmed distillate, not sugar beet.
In the official list of EU registered products, the world-famous cheeses of feta and gorgonzola, marzipane from German Lübeck or Parm ham have already seen carlovarian sugars, burning and peas and jute.
The EU's brand of protection can also be proud of the Pardubic Periphery and the Goric Pipes.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, Ocamura claims
Mr. Senator, how does a man think he wants to run for president?
I'm not talking about being a senator or a president.
If it worked in our country without any problems, I don't care.
But I can't see how the country's been stealing for the last 20 years, how the thieves are running, people are raising their taxes and their retirement age.
I shouldn't have been an ambitious politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I've been 40 years old and I'm an independent non-citizen, I have no other way to influence things than to run for a senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but you've made your moves to the Garden.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've been saying that I'm going to fight the Garden as a result of the Senate elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal, but it's not a function, it's a tool for how I can carry out my vision.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
The problem, however, is not only that as a nation, we donate at home and on television, but that we drown everyone who wants to try to change.
In addition, the media that dehonest people and that distort their freedom of speech lie.
I should have said that I was paying the press or that I was the advisor of Jiří Paroubka.
Let's go to your visas.
In the struggle for the Garden, you have expressed the weight and criminal responsibility of politicians and the return of assets over twenty million.
You have to change the law.
But as President, you have no such authority and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for leadership to be free to live, it succeeded.
The problem is politics - if someone comes up with a good proposal on the left or the right, he will reject it, and the citizens will abstain.
As an independent non-citizen, I have much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My privilege is that without the page boxing and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country on every side and apply it.
Do you think you're more of a man of justice or left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are looking at me on the left.
It doesn't matter to me at all whether it's a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if someone's on the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I'll always support any publicly good solution, even if it's proposed by KSCHM or ODS, and I'll be against the wrong idea anyway.
You're kidding if someone tells you you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you make a business plan in the company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world, or significant experts have talked about them.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only have passwords.
And that's not what you've been doing for a long time in politics.
Or do you think that if you follow people and talk to them, you will be able to carry out for example a criminal and a heavy responsibility?
I don't have another option.
Convinced politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on their side so that we can pass it on.
If I were elected President, it would not be a problem to arrange a direct television broadcast, where I would ask the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the serious and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and state representatives.
And they might have to tell you why they don't want her.
If there is a strong personality that will name corruption, you can press on to the political scene.
Take the President's direct choice, it was a public press duty.
On the level, I say I'm an amateur, that I'm not either a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find allies.
I just started politics, and for my program, I'm trying to get most of the support.
I'm trying to move things myself, if it doesn't work out, in six years I'll end up and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know I'm not doing anything in one person, so I've been running around a number of known people, if they don't go to the Senate, too.
I've been following Radim Janchure, who refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported the investigative journalist Jan Lorench, who was covering up frauds with light fuel oil.
I ran with people being really unhappy, but now I'm in trouble.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, and those who left chose most of the representatives of the establishment.
We're only two independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate in such a way that changes will be difficult to prosecute.
Yet I will fight for my vision, for example for the direct choice of the mayors or the Heitmans.
You're thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven't considered it yet, because I don't have time to check every potential party's clean past, and I don't have any money for it.
I don't even have the money on the presidential campaign, and on my transparent account, there's only 20,000.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
I estimate the private property to be about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land of about 25 million, an apartment of ten million, another apartment of eight million, a collection of works of art of about ten million, an Aston Martin of 3.5 million, and a Superb Shkoda of a million, and then I have a few million on account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boyfriend's dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against corruption and corruption.
You're driving Aston Martin, you have 60 million property and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to give your own money.
That's not too convincing.
I don't have 15 million to campaign.
Is that what I'm supposed to do?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors proves that my program is probably not so interested.
And I don't have to pay for my campaign.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover what I'm going to get a senator's salary.
But I wouldn't survive it, like I couldn't pay my son an English school worth 30,000 a month.
If I just want to make money, I don't go anywhere.
So you're gonna keep up your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd decide these activities?
But it doesn't matter how much you pay.
As I promised, I partially lost my activities.
For example, a passenger will become my representative in spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How many businessmen have you been used to taking a month?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, and I'm taking it on.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You will find the entire interview in the Saturday issue of Law.
Architects MVRDV are proof that real adventures are not only played in the head - e.g. Spijkennie and recently built Hora books - 2 pictures
"This building seems to me happy, it looks futuristic. It is finally seeing something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, who goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technology in a nearby big company, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
Everyone has Internet, iPads and electronic books.
None of these old-style books are going voluntarily today, are they?
Spijkenzen, a location close to Rotterdam without its own work opportunities, which are not even worth visiting, holds a special record.
This community with 80,000 inhabitants shows the lowest education rate across the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision fell to contribute to general education and to build seven beautifully painted iron concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges that are depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive was not at all repulsive.
And so the city councillors knew that there is already only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Wine Maas from the Rotterdam architectural workshop MVRDV, a master of crazyly bold column graphs and a designer of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the thing with ordinary peace and at a competition in 2003 with five books under guard and a slap on the face.
And while the commission was still looking tremendously around and shaking its shoulders, Maas was throwing his presents on himself in size and his activistly reasoned speech ended with the words "Dear City City!"
So this is my proposal on the Horn of Books in Spijkennze, called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, a 30 million-euro mountain was set.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and row homes with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Hora was named by the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated at the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
A small-town shadow that so far has not been able to offer more than a post-modern zone walk and an unusually ugly advisor whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy is richer than a little modern architecture.
Especially now, however, Spijkenze has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
Long journey to the book
First impression: Reading Eldorádo under the roof of cheese.
By means of a massive mountain, you can climb, but you can discover real space and reading passions until you walk through the topography.
On all sides the paved interior is bright and transparent, the floor of the burned cabin and elegant street lamps clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The city environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And books everywhere, books, books.
"There are normally rules with books along the facade, and in the middle there is a large dark space, which is mostly impenetrable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have built the classic space configuration up feet and space for readers we have moved out.
The interior of the Hora books is beautifully used: there are offices, internet library, chess club, ecological center and central home technology.
Special comfort is the black police on books that are one wall covering, one parapet and the other.
View, structure and smell are foreign.
Over the unknown building material, even the architects and construction engineers will turn their heads.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the town of Spijkenze, for a standard magazine question.
And so in one fresh agricultural company, one day we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years it has been used in glass and fields in the Netherlands as a base under the root of a millimetre of synthetic material.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
That textile lasts one, two seasons, and then it's mature to go into the bulky waste.
For the library, runo - first in such a quantity - was cut to four centimeters thick.
The effect of the heat and pressure on the so-called Agricultural Plastic (KLP) will be colored into dark, homogeneous and burdensome material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
You'll reach the top at 105 feet.
At the end of almost 500 meters of long trip you will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and figurines in flowering.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the correct humidity of the air in the literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house is in spite of a lot of glassed surfaces with an example project on ecology," Trouborst says.
It melts and cools with earth's heat.
Though the book of Hora stands under a glass lid, the sun only shines within a short time, even in the sunny days.
Widely beautiful wooden curtains, which stand at the edge of a paved facade, serve as a shade and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The air conditioning in the room is very pleasant.
He'll be able to handle the rest completely automatic.
Stefan Spermon, an IT industry initial skeptic, has already visited a new library.
And Lisette Verhaig was there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, which Boekenberg even refers to as "the long-awaited soul" Spijkenz.
Reason: Every city resident was invited to open up a book from his own personal fund a few weeks ago.
Thus, optical gaps were first to be filled in so far, not entirely equipped with a library that currently contains 70,000 pieces.
The concept has proved itself.
The police are completely filled.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every resident has a certain relationship with the new home.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if she was just in the beauty.
MVRDV has thus failed in the royal discipline, which is called the creation of identity in the professional jargon.
The stories of the literature were written.
Whatever it is young and uneducated.
That's finally the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "The Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained when it decided to adopt Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, Stephen Szaboa is balancing on the narrow limit of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first signaled that it would vote against the proposal for observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
Then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's supporting an American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical to Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting when it came to establishing a free zone.
That's where NATO ended up.
Is it difficult for Germany to deal with serious international issues clearly?
Yeah, that's right.
The reason is that it is just changing its foreign policy, in the direction of the US-led policy, in the direction of German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are between the two fronts.
They're expected to play a more independent role, but they're not used to it.
I think they're just living in their role, but they're on their way to "normaler" foreign policy.
To the foreign policy they have in France or in the United Kingdom.
What specifically does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows willingness to take an interest in national interests and positions that are independent of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. export and its relations with certain areas, whether Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to some extent different from those of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interest affect the position in the Middle East conflict and vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has a large settlement in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to frighten the public, but not the elites in the Arab countries.
That's what it's all about.
I don't want to take it too seriously, but it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
However, it plays an important role in German considerations.
Did it damage Germany's relationship with the United States when both important decisions were held by Germany, for example when voting on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there will be a great understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a break as it was in Libya.
I hope that Germany even has some respect for it.
This indicates that it must be considered as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S. has made itself clear for the veto.
Are there any differences between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always been the result of American internal policy.
I think that Obama's government probably has a considerable understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the darker political situation, this position cannot of course be held out to the public.
I think the differences in opinions are really not as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very interested in Netanyahu's policy.
Is it not difficult for Germany to establish in line with its close relationship with Israel and the USA on the one hand and with the position of the EU's most important partners on the other?
I think that's what makes this very difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for Germany if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently happening.
So they can't be part of a wider line and they have to push things ahead of their own position.
That's exactly what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future and will push Europe into a European position.
This is, of course, not easy for Germany because of its relationship with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a larger role.
For example, if we look at the European crisis, then when Germany takes on a greater role, anti-German moods will emerge.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
From this point of view, Germany is much more difficult than the USA.
It must be acceptable to the most diverse neighbours and opinions, and that's not easy.
The impact of the United States on European politics is still declining, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even though they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and it'll make them a lot more unpopular - c'est la vii!

"Save Tag" in China: when Puma and Armani are all of a sudden Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
What is Armani Polo?
This is a hidden label that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection so long as it is not regretted by the real owners of the stamps.
And it's not even clear if the rights are coming.
"For foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, who specializes in violating the rights in the Far East.
There's a new case coming up on my desk every week.
A few more letters are enough for the cheaters to register their badges.
For example, from the Gucci brand it will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada they let Prada-Kny register.
In this way, German companies, like the Puma sports product manufacturer, are legally copied.
The Pattloch opens the order with the registrations of the sign office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company was allowed to protect its brand Zigen DF Puma. An artificial name that also parasites in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zigen.
It is known that the Chinese are the world's masters in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities there are several shopping houses that are almost exclusively sold for sale.
Pattloch's cases are different, however. By entrusting its mandates, it is against the Chinese companies being given the right to use a label that is already protected elsewhere from the trademark office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", the associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan."
That's what women who hunt rich men are like.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt.
"It hurts business, we have to throw it away," Pattloch calls out.
"The sign is dissolving, the exceptional position is disappearing, the damage of the image is huge."
Financial losses and the costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially in the case of expensive sample products.
According to CLSA market research company, China is the third largest market in luxury goods and the fastest growing market of 15 billion euros per year.
However, a variety of questionable records in the trademark register can be easily achieved and something is worth it.
Control can be extended to nine years, with an unusual result.
The Pattloch will report cases where the court has rejected the proceedings, because the name in question has become "market reality" for a long time.
If the complainant has a bad side, he still has to pay the plagiarism because he has damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Known cases are also related to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of the construction machinery of Sana, a company that recently took over the German manufacturer of pumps on the concrete mixture Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use a emblem that resembles the star Mercedes.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue logo that reminded BMW. The spore was balanced, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of fashion goods lost Lacoste in China with the smugglers from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the known crocodiles in the wrong direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt.
However, the CCMO pointed out that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too small numbers of employees and space.
But last year, "the process of work has returned from an emergency to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell by 22 per cent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still waiting at the office for 81,500 complaints to be filed.
Something against it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were granted to CTMO, which is almost a third more than 2010.
That's a record, and it means China is behind it runs a list of new applications around the world.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were selected at the fees.
This simply means that each application is an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euro.
The case of the German family company Freudenberg is being challenged for several reasons.
This group has been fighting the Chinese plagiarism for more than seven years.
However, the Germans have achieved that its illegal production of imitation car parts has been abolished.
However, the traitor secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg mark still.
We ourselves would mention this because in Germany the names cannot be protected, says Hanno Wenzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
At the same time, CTMO has also rejected the objection of the Munich company.
In the other two instances Freudenberg has reached the right, but the resistance in the dispute continues to fight today.
We need to be very careful.
The case is now before the Supreme Court.
Wenzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and that the professionalism of the courts will be praised.
But he also says, "The driving is extremely expensive and it takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be counted. In the company's archives, they had to go through a hundred years of old records to submit evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg, on the other hand, offered a "high sixteenth in euros" for the purpose of settling the dispute.
"You see what this means to us," says Wenzler.
It threatens that the dangers from the Far East will also affect Europe.
And that's where the copyists get unprotected.
One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to apply the Freudenberg marking in Germany for shoes and leather.
This area of business has long been abandoned, but has been able to reverse registration.
"It's necessary to be very careful," says Wenzler.
He and the lawyer Pattloch advise the German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Foreigners would rather have "everything that stands for protection, even in China," says Wenzler.
Otherwise it could be much more expensive than registration.
As a result, if Freudenberg is subject to the mark in the last act of his drama, then it is likely that he will have to pay the licence fees on his own behalf, explains Wenzler.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World Day of Fighting AIDS: Assault, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Congregation is tested - and in Swaziland the orphans are delighted to see their parents die of AIDS.
The history of the connection, which exceeds much more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there's the ass: cowboy high shoes, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and ladies' backpacks are looking for tats in the park and they're quick to find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - come slowly, Mom and fight each other.
The 29-year-old director Fiete Hopfa almost lifts it from his textile boots when he connects his voices with his trainy wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music scene of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Imbongi is testing a new song.
There were fifty singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from the researcher on human genetics to the householder.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each congregation voice has another text and also in a very foreign language - zulu, which speaks eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help to Help
Unaids, a United Nations programme to eradicate AIDS, estimates that around 34 million people are living around the world infected with HIV.
Of that, 23.5 million lives in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 orphans after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans who died on AIDS, in the village of Esiten, a company of Voices for Africa has found patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend second grade school.
You can take over the patronage in 15 or 20 euros a month.
It guarantees the child school, school uniform and one hot meal a day in the Gogo Centre.
Imbongi means in the Zulu language "storymaker" or also "the one who celebrates".
There's no one in this room who can't talk about gas, just sing.
For almost ten years he has been practicing the congregation in this foreign soft language and sometimes brings them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
The air is 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg, because it is located in the northeastern part of the Swedish Kingdom of Esiten, which depends on the ability of the voices of the German congregation.
Forty percent is infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay or strawberries, most of them children.
More than 300 of them don't have parents anymore because they've been infected with HIV.
In Estonia it is seen in small what the state of the whole of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy throughout the world according to UNICEF.
The male predisposition, which clearly reduces the risk of infection by half, does not accept the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland are carrying the virus of weakened immunity within themselves. There is no coincidence that they die in a few thirty years.
This village was visited by the congregation along the way to Africa in spring 2005. However, Imbongi’s members saw many children on the streets not only lacking parental care but also clean everything: food, clothing, education.
Without finishing school they have no chance in the poor country at all.
At first it was still a private placement for individuals who allowed a couple of euros a year to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, the Voices for Africa community was founded, which since then took care of orphans after the parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomavir, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Coins and confectionery belong to parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the most deprived group?
Syphilis and ponytails occur especially among men who have sex with men.
The Constitution of Robert Kocha is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases are common, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidosis (fever), psoriasis and human papillomavir.
HIV is among the heterosexual adults we have relatively little spread, but about 20 percent of newly infected HIV belongs to this group.
Among adolescents, Chlamydi infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are common among young people.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
According to Robert Kocha, the number of infected with syphilids increased from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of newly infected persons has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2700 cases.
It's about a decade less than a year ago.
What are some signs of sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause joints in the area of genitalia, difficulty in urination, swelling, pain in the abdomen and blisters or nipples.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore they will remain undetected.
How can we protect ourselves?
Hazardous infections can reduce condoms, but they do not offer foot-and-mouth protection.
Because the origins of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted to infections from impurities and close physical contact.
This is why experts recommend regular examinations, in particular in the case of frequent sexual partners.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPIs and prevent subsequent consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable gifts, and in the final series of honoraries, which the congregation will make singing all over Germany, some money will be collected.
"We've already sent about 200,000 euros to Estonia," said President Annette Lennartz.
Money from Germany manages in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious woman who can be planted.
He also takes care to find a host of orphaned children, such as some of his grandmothers.
Gogo, as Zulu is called to old women, is the village's fortress.
Some of them took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children were delivered to school every day in uniforms.
Children who no longer have anyone, go to refuge in Khanyisile, a lonely woman who pays for the company as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" founded a school of sewing, built two chickens and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged that many people in the village had to perform a HIV test.
It's not of course, even if the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has something to do with sexuality."
Actually, it's pretty weird in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absoluteist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immeasurable lifestyle.
Let's say instead of democracy.
The way of life approved by this state, among other things, is also responsible for the rapid spread of HIV virus in the past decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the earth.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact."
To at least support cultural exchange, the Imbongi Congregation travels once in two, three years together throughout South Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, wars, confidence in the future and self-awareness of black people who have known in the southern part of the Black continent since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such appreciation brings not only joy and joy, but also tears have already been shed by many wild border soldiers.
The path always leads to Esitina, where the singers visit the children over whom they have a patronage.
Even though this village is hard to find on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is more than known.
"Go to Estonia, there's light," people say.
And when you get back to Heidelberg, which is an airtight 8733 kilometers away, to the asshole singers in the Bergheimer Straße experiment, you see that light shines here.
Messenger: NASA found ice in Mercury
Sonda Messenger has found evidence that Mercury is iced on planet Earth.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. National Aviation and Cosmonautique Authority (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on planet Mercury.
Even though there is the nearest Sunny, there is also cold water, as it comes from three studies published on Thursday by the specialized magazine "Science".
Sonda Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the area of this planet lying in a permanent shadow.
It's supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe even up to 20 meters strong.
This water came from all comets or perhaps even the asteroids that attacked Mercury.
But let's not find ice in relation to the existence of life on this planet, said leading scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us to explain how water and other basic elements of life have gone into other areas of the solar system.
The probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix, unattended landowners, are involved in the exploration of the depth of the universe.
From time to time, images will be sent to Earth, a small window to endless distance.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides the suffering planet of Ceres.
Like Pluto, which surrounds the Sun after Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This cut from the infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, worse identifiable are pink-coloured "news" on the birthplace of the stars.
This area where the stars are formed - scientists call it the W5 - has discovered Spitzer's telescope in Cassiopeia's constellation in the distance of 6500 light years.
This changing heat of dying stars caught Spitzer's telescope NASA.
The dome ring consists of material that the star has decomposed during the process of dying.
In the vast trifle, which is 5400 light years away from Earth, a new star emerges from the gas and dust.
The photo of the Galactic "cobbles" was directed by the NASA Spitzer telescope.
The Pleiade Star Cup, also called "Seven Sister", is only seen in the night.
Thanks to telescopes, however, colors will be better.
Helix can be seen on this infrared image as a red eye.
It is located in the distance of 700 light years from the Constituent of Water.
Its similarity to the earthly part of the world produced this mythical name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the origin of unusual coloring.
This "minimum" among the stars has been able to climb in full beauty to the infrared detectors of Spitzer's telescope.
Saturn and his ring: how they emerged is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
I hope it's the rest of Saturn's month that disappeared four and a half billion years ago without a trace.
One of Hubble's largest and most sharpest images of the telescope: the faith galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloring, become real works of art.
The survey published by the European Southern Observer shows a few thousand light-years away from the Trifid mine in the constellation of the Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triple), because the dark thresholds of dust divide the hot heart of this star family into three parts.
In the constellation Hadonos, astronomers photographed the prehistoric cosmic collision: within 400 million light years from Earth, the wife of the core of two colloidal galaxies must inevitably reach the wheel.
This creation of the star recorded Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like a technical shortcut can call it the South Windmill.
The photograph from Hubble's space-dwelling view shows the intersection of the Iris butterfly in the Cefea Constellation.
This 1400 light years away mine consists of dust grains, which are ten times as much as a hundred times as the usual household dust.
This image was composed of optical and x-ray images of different telescopes.
It depicts a ring of black holes that is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, recorded Hubble's space remote view for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called the UGC 1810.
There is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The cluster of stars gives rise to new growths.
Also, this star cloud, coupled with the moon Rosette, still produces new young stars. They are 5000 light years away from Earth.
In this clearly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was just a short time after the Great War when it was mostly hydrogen.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
The remote view was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. He used it a year later to observe the stars before Galileo.
Since then, the mirror of optical remote views has been increasing - and the views that are mediating are getting deeper.
The world’s largest distant view was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale’s telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror on this image had an average of five meters.
There's a Large Binocular Telescope in the U.S. Arizona.
It allows you to see the universe through two mirrors, each of which has an average of 8.4 meters.
Inside Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only mirror measures on average 10,4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to match costs.
Yet its average reaches about 11 meters.
The economic disadvantage of the design: the telescope is secured by the hakkade in a high angle and its mobility is limited.
The high angle telescope Hobby-Eberly is also located in Texas.
Its peculiarity is the high intensity of the light stream.
Despite the relatively small average, this mirror is equal to the world's largest mirror view.
Radiotelescopes in Arecib, Puerto Rico, are looking for scientists in space for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has an average of 305 meters.
At "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - looking for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who provides its computer performance.
View of the Observatory of the European Southern Observatory (ECO) in the Chilean Andean.
They're standing here with Very Large Telescope and they honor their name.
This remote view with a total of four mirrors can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large distance is also planned for Chilean ESO observers.
Its main mirror should be full of 42 metres and should consist of nearly 1000 mirrors.
However, images can be counted first in 2018.
Two Keck's remote views of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They're offering two mirrors right now, each with an average of ten meters.
Keck's remote views are part of Mauna Kea's observatorium, which looks beyond them into space and using Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea is supposed to be a new large telescope - with a 30-inch diameter of the mirror.
Here you can admire her image.
However, the most important perceptions from the universe are the means of Hubble's cosmic remoteness.
The photographs of the distant worlds have been providing us with since 24 April 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extra solar planets since March 2009 - especially those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets have been identified since the start of the mission.
The last preparations are documented before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webba (JWST) space shuttle will be fired into space on board the Ariane5 rocket first in 2018.
The primary mirror of the outer infrared telescope has an average of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies by the Great Trembling.
Scientists are based on the fact that ice is also on the south of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the Messenger circle around this planet is closer to the north pole.
Radar measurements have shown that it's been on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent in 2004 and is the first one that surrounds Mercury, scientists now have confidence.
Drink butter daily and live for 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people have a Bible age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for traces in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people have a Bible age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for traces in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
I'm going to burn Talysh. We can call the savages romantic.
The microbus runs along the road with many turns along the densely wooded hills, river and simple rural buildings.
Everything is green and green, as soon as it seems we're in Schwarzwald.
But this here is the most beautiful in Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talyas, which is not well known, lives, except that she speaks perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and has a very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is haunted by too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are not coming here. The arrival from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers because the road is only one-way.
The historical wealth that the land thanks for oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet reached.
However, Pilate Fatulajeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Grand Prize Eurovise in May - and we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world next year," Fatulajeva says.
He's the director of a museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is a documented life of almost eight dozen Thais from around who are over a hundred years old. Fatulajeva shows a black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still had a baby.
However, the controversial star of this museum is the shepherd of the Şarali Müslümov sheep, who was allegedly 168 years old.
However, the birth certificate does not exist.
And since the oldest man with the documents was 122 years old, the Muslim age seems to be extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulajeva.
This man was supposed to be married three times and had 23 children.
So didn't Şarali İrāli Муслимовов in his age for a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the people flying in Central Asia.
"At least a lot of people of high age live in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also lives in Sardinia extremely many very old men."
However, due to missing foundations, there can be no scientific evidence of age, especially if the matrix is missing.
Each day the bottle of dissolved butter
In fact, people in the area around Leric have been able to experience the Bible’s age as often as possible.
At present there are 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
So why do so many flying people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani leader Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Talyshes.
On the contrary, the director of Fatulje's museum believes that it rests in food.
However, the fact that it is the caloric food of the Thais who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, from a bromatological point of view, does not seem to be quite plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, the dwelling of Rubab Mirzajev.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young on this geographical scale.
Mirzajev, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He's sitting on the ground with the butter she's struggling with.
Under one roof, eight people live here, including one of Mirza's sons and daughters.
There's two little kids jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is given in typical "armada" jars.
The white teeth of Mirzaev make up a perfect row and under the handle hides a long dark blonde copy that proudly exposes her son to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look like me and they kept their color.
"That's how I've never used shampoo," says Mirzaeva.
Monthly pension to life is enough
She always ate only what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
For the rest of my life, I haven't even bought food in a supermarket once.
Then he'll tell me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was for the second world war.
But it all got better when he took over "loved father" Geidar Aliev.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is made around the figure of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003 and then took over his son Ilham.
Old people in Azerbaijan don't have to suffer at least.
Mirzajeva receives 230 manat's pension every month (approximately the same amount in euro).
And maybe even Mirza's son is right a long time ago: "Old people live in our culture of great importance."
They live in the middle of a large family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
If there's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" in the constitution is missing
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The deplorable demonstrations in Cairo revealed a deep dissatisfaction of the country.
The acute debate is on the future constitution based on the rule of law of the Sharia.
The Egyptian president didn't look into the pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And for our success, I am responsible, before men and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the whole nation, especially to the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims, and the secular ones.
All of them, so far, have been hopelessly divided into confused opposition, because they are afraid.
Fear of "the state of God" on the Nile, issued for the grace of a powerful Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursí almost politely announced that he had transitionally restricted the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and extended his own to "guard the revolution".
However, what a 61-year-old engineer who has the title of a doctor at the American University of Southern California really wants to save, is that the Egyptians don't have a clear world.
Should the judiciary be saved by power?
234 paragraphs, which were soon approved by the Governing Body of the Islamic Overweight Assembly in the 15th hour marathon, are partly a source of concern.
As in previous institutions, this proposal also says that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
It was and is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists are using this vague formulation and the associated legal free space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least this sheds light on the new paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great impact on the whole Sunni Islam.
It doesn't have to, but it can mean that the clarius will be overseeing legislation, which would bring the justice to the actual withdrawal of the right.
In the draft constitution there are many things to be interpreted
The problem is also that the civil power of military courts is still to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubara's governments to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, there were as many as 11,000 civilians in military custody.
As stated in the proposal, it should also protect "the right of the Egyptian family and support its morals and values".
This is so inaccurately formulated on the legal side that the state institutions can even control the content of film art and literature by means of this paragraph.
In a understandable word, it means nothing but censorship.
No other paragraph shall specify in writing the explicit equality between men and women.
Therefore, another paragraph prohibits the use of or slandering the prophet Mohammed and his emissaries.
But there's still some confusion about what's embarrassing and how it's gonna be achieved.
There is no doubt that "infection of people" is prohibited.
In this case, is the President's caricature enough or a joke on the account of the law-enforcement experts?
The matter of interpretation, as many others in this proposal, which the Mursi submits for signature, and according to its words, it will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of human voting.
"The revolution has returned"
For a few weeks now, opposition to Islamist forces has been formed.
Tens of the people gathered on Friday evening at Tahrír Square in Kahir and promised to destroy the constitutional charter before it began to pay.
"The revolution has returned and we win," said Hamdin Sabbáhi, who took his place in the third place in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize Carrier and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej declared that the constitution's proposal belongs to "the site of history".
By means of short news services Twitter accused Mursi of wanting to carry out a "snake against democracy".
"If he issues a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw it away," said opposition officer Jásir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," the Egyptian media quoted Cháilid Ali as an opposition policy.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to watch a referendum, which would become invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a protest, but not in Tahrí’s Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before the Cairo University.
She was attended by many distraught women and Salafists who called out: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called out to Mursi: 'Exalted is the earth' and they said: 'The Koran is our Remembrance'
The struggle for superiority over the symbolic capital Tahrí, where everything began, would probably trigger a similar civil war.
Mursi's supporters obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that the supporters and supporters of the constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let people at election hours decide which way the country should go.
Most are considered to be for the benefit of the Islamic proposal.
"The word 'lid law' doesn't come out once"
A forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all the social forces, is held by the Hafiz Abu Sa'du.
Eighty-eight years human rights defender and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in or before Mubarak in prison.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are inseparable for him.
He was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned for that.
"And in the new constitution now there are no 'lidish rights' even once," he complains in the interview for "Welt am Sonntag".
The Mursi expansion of power to all three power components in the state has led this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandal against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of the President's strengthening of civil society, he has actually abolished it," complains Sa'da.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Sa'da also feels abandoned by the international community, which is following the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be his revenge.
Demonstrant at Tahrír Square warns: "You have created a monster you can no longer control."
Norwegian Cancer: The most delicious fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the country's secret of success be linked to the local appetite for extraordinarily delicious fish?
Take a few mature cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football equipment.
Let it lie down for a week.
Then you will get your paralysing smells of raphic, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the little town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, a beautiful view - and there's plenty of smell in the air.
Rakfisk is a salty peach boiled in the water for up to one year - depending on how much you want the fish to smell.
As she smiles and starts to be cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes start meeting at a festival dedicated to this, as they say the best, most delicious food.
"You're dreaming of cheese and then you're drinking a glass of aquivit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional fireman, but also called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
People around us eat small pieces of fish and drink them a lot of alcohol.
"Some people have better aquavit than raffis," says Havard.
The potion can break the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not that bad - it's a similar piece of sushi that was on the long way by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of very different times when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no ice creams yet, fish in the autumn flocked to the air-tight vessels with water and salt.
Then in the middle of the winter, when they were well digested, they pulled out and ate - the meanings of no doubt melted with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Nora were forced to leave their country and look for a job, most of which they emigrated to the United States.
At the present time, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracted to a large amount of work, high benefits and a comprehensive care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival, which had recently been much richer than Norway, will enter the country for work.
Racfisk is seen as something important, unparalleled, even though the relatively fascinating part of the Norwegian past.
It's one of the most expensive food on the market.
Even though expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or sandwich you will get 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway is often lacking in world news - and it seems that most of its inhabitants are doing so.
The name Anderse Breivika, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, there are still people talking about resentment.
Instead, the shooting is called "the 22nd of July".
The Norwegians can hardly believe that one of them was capable of such brutality and murder in their peaceful country.
The current wealth of Norway lies in the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world since the early 1970s.
"But the oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, represents the prototype of northern prosperity.
We're, like you say, thoughtful people.
Its English, like the English of most people here, is completely unusual.
We don't pretend. We don't like chance.
Norway is very careful about its oil wealth - with the exception of a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for the future generation.
When all the others in the years leading to the global financial crisis wasted money that they did not have, the Norses were heavily weighed down on their bag.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go on vacation in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat raffisk," he adds with no carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow front for something to eat - I've had enough.
Such a bad burger is certainly something else, and he's pretty cute.
But tonight's a fascinating fish back here.
The hotel where I live is one of many places where lunch is served and where guests choose the best, or rather for their most demanding fish.
They have a connection to live television transmission, where the moderator with the motel is surrounded by raffis.
It's like a Eurovision singing contest.
"What's your score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"Here's our puncture, Havard."
It's called flattery and laughter.
A man will fall out of his chair, perhaps equipped with an aquavit.
And maybe all those fish are washed away.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As the upcoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto prepares to take over the office, Will Grant from BBC considers the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is also trapped in the best times, there were steel bans closing several key routes into the main city and causing road chaos.
However, the aim was not to prevent those who went to work, but to prevent those who protested from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the President's scarf and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a difficult task.
Mexico at the time of the departure of Felipe Calderon was a good economic leader, but the country is in a drug war which has been estimated to have killed 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to Mexico's people in reducing violence," President Pena Nito told US President Barack Obama at the Oval Works at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before he shook his hand with the U.S. president, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his country of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the human and extended state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo they remember him in good faith.
Citizens attribute to it the development of tourism in aviation and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now drive to the city after one of the new roads that made Pena Néto build. These roads are a huge improvement against the rough and rough roads that were here before.
Discs with its name also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring about a real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally Gabriel Olver Hernandez, state MP on behalf of President Pen Nieta, the institutionalised revolution party (PRI).
In particular, we look forward to interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of uninterrupted power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicente Fox.
Ambassador Olver admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace Los Pinos is expecting a lot inside of Enrique Pena Nieta.
And he rejects the statement of opposition characterizing the new president as a man without material content.
He's a very polite man, very interested in the excellent vision of the earth.
He's a great statesman, and he's mostly a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression that many people have from their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the narrow streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
In many countries, road traffic is a reminder of the suburb of Mexico’s own capital.
And the problems in the local community are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, an army was called up to help with the control of drug gangs operating in the districts, especially palatial violence against women.
Only in the last two years have the bodies of dozens of murdered women been buried in empty spaces next to the huge waste compound.
By the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murders of innocent women.
In a better case, critics of Pena Nieta say that when she was acting in the office, she failed to deal adequately with the problem of women's murder.
And in the worst case, they blame him for closing their eyes.
In the concrete house, typical of the destroyed neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me pictures of her daughter Mariana Luna, who is crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I came to her house, it seemed as if her body was washed," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of beatings on him, and a postmortem blindness had begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were warned.
The state authorities treated me like I was a tough old woman, a tough girl and a nun.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up.
"But it can't be right when there's so many mistakes and reminders," he says.
The sherpa that President Pena Nieto receives on Saturday is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of tens of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime and the new president has promised that his office will be given priority over time.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was the governor," says PRI Olver in Valle del Bravo.
But that's exactly what the victims' families in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the wrong behavior, military prosecutor said.
The military prosecutor is trying to reverse Bradley Manning's statement regarding harsh treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be rejected on the basis of harsh treatment with Manning in prison.
The military is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that the army of Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest escape of secret material in the history of the United States, has missed many opportunities to complain about the harsh treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor May. Ashden Fein at a cross-examination by Manning's army during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Maede in Maryland claimed that the weekly visits that Manning had with the unit officials during the nine months of his imprisonment in Quantica in Virginia do not show any complaints about the wrong conduct.
The cross-examine that occurred during the hearing held on the defence proposal to reject the case against Manning for cruel treatment during the time of the arrest, which was self-punishable, took place the day after Manning testified that he considered suicide in the prison.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein passed together with Manning's forms, which officials filled out after meeting Manning in the Quantico prison prison where he was detained in an increased alert regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday for these forms, Manning admitted that the treatment by his guards was "excellent" and the overall treatment in the facility was "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints about the wrong conduct, even though officials of Manning directly asked how they were treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that concerns about various problems had been voiced and that officials who visited him had talked to him about these concerns and indicated that they would be taken care of, but did not notice these problems.
"They wrote "no problems" (after they discussed the concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain to his own person in January 2011 when he met with the commission of self-sacrifice, which he said several months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the "avourability prevention" regime.
The army stated that it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under the suicide surveillance regime) for its protection and safety to others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this wound prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the improved quality of life as I saw it," said Manning.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transport to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transported to the prison on the basis of seamen in Quantica in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was thinking about suicide in Kuwait, and once he was there, for a reason, he fainted.
He said that he was not allowed to know what was going on with him and what was going on around the world was very exciting.
"My world just collapsed on the Arifján base, on the kid," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving in Quantica he spent most of his days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in small cells without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, cover, phone rings, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or lying was during the day against the rules.
Manning said he always slept with the light on the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned on the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's legal representative filed a formal complaint in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for an accusation he made in a Thursday statement that after having been forced to sleep one night in his Quantica cell naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guard and other associations at the early hours of the count.
Manning said he wasn't allowed to hide his cover when he was counting.
On Friday's hearing, Judge Manning stated that, by order of his officers, he had determined that he had a cover which could be covered, but admitted that no one had issued him an order to deposit it.
On Thursday Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to prove to the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use the belt from his underwear or his phone calls to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that that night his underwear, his phone rings and glasses were removed.
His legal representative hopes that the judge will take into account his experience of his imprisonment and that, in his case of his testimony before the military court, whose beginning is expected at the beginning of next year, his sentence will be significantly reduced.
The defense stated that it plans to admit Manning to guilt in lower criminal offences and that he will fight against other charges because they are too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend the relevant conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon stated that Manning was kept in accordance with the provisions concerning all detainees in connection with the maximum alert.
Among the charges brought against Manning are the aid of the enemy, the unlawful inducement of the publication of reports on the Internet, the transmission of information concerning national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he is accused in all points, he may be sentenced to life.
My crisis Mexican-American identities
He says a lot of people were forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient possibilities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are greedy between the two worlds.
Last time I went to Mexico's capital, I barely broke into a dam, and I came into the area for an immigrant agenda where I was in trouble.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexiconos" ("Mexicon") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Cisinci").
I was standing there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
It's an ethnic shortcut, just like when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
So later I ended up with the name "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, it wasn't necessary to use shorts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I don't have the vocabulary of the native speaker and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American belt and set up in front of "Externaneros."
I was thinking about the moment this week when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nie visited the White House of President Obama.
The programme has usually had issues that are being discussed when leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is equally likely that Mexicans will stay in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a trading bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue in the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced its leader under threat to rewrite half of the Mexican territory into the United States.
But for Mexicans who think over the centuries, not minutes, comments are available everywhere.
So one minute after the U.S. representative says something critical about Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and between the elite complaints about how Americans are involved in the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And Montezumi's children will walk on the war road.
And yet for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico there are winners and defeats, people that the country offers opportunities, and others that it does not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point of our family tree, there was a person, perhaps a parent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person is in line with the profile - dark skin, poor education, the origin of poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we now live in an American dream, we go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live in an American dream, not a Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And besides, we know that many elite Mexicans in the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and they view us as a sub-racial race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our route to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is in their view only a failure.
If our families didn't succeed in Mexico, they'd never leave her.
And we would not now be trapped for a cowardly attack, with a good life in the United States, but even with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who was legally travelling to the United States in childhood, reminds me that there is a tension between Mexicans and Mexicans because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans don't like it.
Although he is a citizen of the United States, he sees himself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part of it.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstein.
You'll get the best out of both countries, but you don't even have the roots in one.
In Mexico he looks at us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora again.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country and press the political leader to strengthen relations with Mexico.
No, no, no.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, my friends.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States how they dealt with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still do not feel the way their family members were treated in a much closer past.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ending of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an unparalleled basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that every such incident is void.
Among the usual remaining clues about who started this, many buildings were turned into ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most civilians, and six Israelis. The first rockets from Gaza fell near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order and the Palestinians and Israel, whether they like it or not, are caught in chaos in the region.
Maybe it'll make their fight even more bloody than ever before.
However, there are reasons to believe that this could disrupt their mortal pathetic situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance it seems that there are not many reasons for optimism at the moment.
Even if the ceasefire on 21 November lasted, the fights this week would strengthen the ice on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled in Gaza since 2007, will claim to have led the Israelites to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the poorest and most populous corners of the planet, Hamas was unable to destroy Israel.
And in fact, Hamas has an influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently ruled by his nagging rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian fraction.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas can very well judge that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world have gained greater influence, so Hamas has gained strong and rich friends.
Turkey, the re-caught regional power that was once the closest Muslim ally to Israel, joined Hamas. Also Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Hamas people say that the Islamic semi-month is surrounded by Israel, north of Lebanon, where the ruler/military of Hezballáh, across Syria, where rebels who are increasingly turning away from Islam can sit Bashar Asada, until after Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, far from the most populous and complaining Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular deputy who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the brotherhood is the brother of Hamas and his leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be excluded by either Israel or America.
On the contrary, the Israeli supporters of the hard lines come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in bed.
The Israeli anti-missile system The Iron Dome proved its price and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelites can sleep better - for a moment.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as uninhabitable as ever. Many European countries have also vinyl Hamas from the start of the last round of violence.
And above all, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahua, the president of the government, which largely ignored the peace process.
Although since 2004, missiles from Gaza killed about 30 Israelis, Israel has been relatively calm from suicide bombers, thanks to the wall that affects the West Bank, the main part of what a Palestinian state might once be, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite its illegality against international law.
Prime Minister Netanjahu, whose party Likud joined the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the beginning of the campaign on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why waste those filthy Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Bank, wouldn't they fire missiles like their residents in Gaza?
It'll be better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them when they hit their heads.
Maybe the supporters of the hard line win, but the Arab Spring can change their proposals.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not have Israel too much in love, their primary priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel’s defence expenditure is higher than the expenditure of all its four Arab neighbours together.
The launch of a new war with local sovereignty will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economies.
The fact that President Mursi was working with President Barack Obama to stop the fire is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelites too should have a long - term view of the situation.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, it creates a violation of the Palestinians' right to self-determination with a gunshot work that must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel - just as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
At present, repression is weakening the Jewish state of democracy, and demographics are still worsening as the Arab population grows.
Blood spills against Gaza that are taking place every few years in order to suppress Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives outside.
The answer is what reasonable people say on both sides, most of the outside world and these newspapers: two states where Israel will land for security.
In the short term, there is little hope that stopping the fire will give the outside pressure at least a little more influence on the disposal of this thing.
Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar must establish a stop to arms supplies in Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
Arab outsiders must also press for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual State sovereignty in the United Nations.
President Obama also has his part to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first election period, he ignored the presentation of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems to be as curious in his entry into the process.
That's unfortunately short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia entered into force of the Dirty Cigarettes Act
In spite of the green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, warnings are displayed for smokers and sick parts of the body.
The Australian law on dirty tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, came into force, and the logo and color of the brand replaced with general olive green boxes with vivid images of sick parts of the body and depiction of children and newborns who are ill as a result of their parents ’ smoking.
In addition to various health warnings and images, the only difference between the boxes is the name of the marks printed in the same small font.
This is the most beautiful regime in the world with regard to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government argues that the aim is to turn young people away from smoking by ridding them of their attractiveness.
It depends on a study that shows that if people don't start smoking at the age of 26, there's a 99% chance they won't start smoking at all.
"Even in very small children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell together with their product," says the Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that have shown, for example, that children attach a crown in the window with the idea of being princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of transnational companies, other countries consider introducing similar measures.
The tobacco industry strongly praised the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trade in the black market, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation brings serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Falsifiers from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarettes packages from silicone serving to cover disgusting boxes, two months ago when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco had lost their appeal regarding Australian Supreme Court laws, increased almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico had sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesalers and was expecting new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As possible, the experts are suggesting the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan is focused.
After a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes in front of direct view, tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space left for the promotion of your products, online space is an insurmountable place for you to be," says Becky Freeman, a research worker in public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman noted an increase in the rating of social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average Honzou".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave his job and created this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia argues that the sector is focused on how it imposes new regulations rather than marketing.
The sector has gone so far that it has paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacks on new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organisation declare that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries trade with Australia significantly.
The adoption of the SOO Decision is expected in the mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has conducted talks with other governments that consider similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to take mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
More than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine, have now expanded.
The more stringent laws are considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the South African Republic and India.
A lot of chickens in Australia.
The images have no effect on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You'll just pull out a cigarette and pull the box back," says Victor El Hage when you buy a box with a picture of cancer in your mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason I quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in central Sydney, claims that the single boxes make it harder for him to balance them into magazines.
"It took me one hour to pay," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'Okay, that's the end, we'll close the barn'," he said and decided with his hands.
It's not so bad to be bored in a world of unstoppable connections
The last day of thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about the nude.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting for half a day at the airport for another year is quite annoying, even through the spread of books, magazines and iPhones (excluding duty-free shops).
But some scientists and children's development experts are getting more and more bored.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting ways, which can support creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen today, we have no chance of being bored.
So should we support the nude?
Yes.
Oh, no.
But I'll be back.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that came with more free time.
But as Peter Toohey says, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (History of nude) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, she has a long history of boredom," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii there was a Latin inscription concerning nude, from the first century of our year.
And then there's also a question of how we define nude.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University, Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and presenting ideas to the target group about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to do it."
The nude is different from the apathy because the person is not involved in anything, but she wants to be.
He says there's no need to do anything about the apathy.
He says that the nude core is "distortion of the process of attention associated with a bad mood and a sense of slow running time."
The boredom can remind you of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship, boring people tend to see a problem like the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment, where participants listened to the tape, on which the person read an article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated TV program in a nearby room, others heard it so quietly that they hardly noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems with concentration, but were not sure why and attributed these problems to boredom.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or challenging task, a disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you're doing something boring, "as it's looking for the wrong parts on the factory line, it can be exciting music to help you don't get bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that bending and chewing, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically more attentive.
"The research shows that children who are allowed to spin will learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," said Professor Fenska.
We've all experienced boredom at times - delaying my flight, ringing player, especially a long film.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure the nude, scientists in the 80s of the last century developed "Stupnici for Nausea" (Boredom Proness Scale).
Steps include questions such as: "Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
With these degrees, scientists have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular, as regards the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally inconceivable.
In 1991 Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of those who were teenagers said that they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said that they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he doesn't know if the percentage expression of nude would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said that he knows that "adulting is a supreme time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is the boredom good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take an absurd physical risk, play gambling or abuse conventional substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"There's a way to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing you should do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy only for a moment, not for a long time.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't learn how to have fun or drive himself, Professor Fenska said.
And "this independent procedure is transmitted from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child not only learns how to have fun but gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate the nude.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her.
Our goal should be to be more comfortable when we are able to achieve continuous activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We blame her for the need to get bored even more, but the boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly being overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways of having fun when the noise turns off."
There is no handbook on the new marijuana law in Colorado
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at high school and a footballer from South-East Colorado, faces the charge of criminal acts for something that will soon be legal in the whole state - for holding several grams of marijuana and tobacco used for her smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one dawn day he went with a few friends in Lamar on the shores near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the policeman found in a marijuana car, Mr. Orozco was given a call to hold drugs and equipment for the use of drugs - minor offences in which there are 100 USD for each fine - and he was given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
Within the few weeks following a colourful vote on the legalisation of a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of minor drug cases is more likely to occur than in the law.
Hundreds of cases of Marijuana possession offences have already been cancelled here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police department has ceased to accuse adults aged 21 and older for holding a small quantity which will be legally allowed after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But the plaintiffs in the more conservative sects of Colorado have declared that they will continue with existing cases of marijuana, and still accuse people of detention.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver, towards the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana shops in their villages.
"This matter is developing so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads are shaking and regulators in the state of Washington.
And they're looking for instructions on how to set up a system of licences for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or bad, is ahead of most states in marijuana regulation, first for medical use and now for recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesperson for licensing the sale of alcohol in Washington State.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than propose what might work.
"There is no real precedent for us to drive," he said.
Washington Law, i.e. I-502, acquires effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal detention.
And there are marked mechanical issues that need to be addressed during this period, such as how to apply the State Directive on "relevant access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on trafficking in rope up to 330 metres from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or kindergartens.
"There won't be any more difficulty in placing a licensed know-how shop than in urban areas, especially in the Metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, spokesperson of the Centre for legal know-how, recently established research groups.
On 21 November, police chief Oates sent his e-mail to his officers from Aurora, in which he announced that the city prosecutor would no longer complain about the small amount of marijuana held by every citizen aged 21 and that the police "with immediate validity" would stop people from accusing them of these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would promote city laws governing drug addicts and that they would continue to complain about drug dealers and dealers.
In the period Weld in North Colorado, the interim prosecutor Ken Buck is a more stringent view.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to fight the cases of marijuana retention, most of which as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
At present, the charge of holding 56 grams or less marijuana is facing 119 people, although many of them face another charge.
"Our office is obliged to file a criminal offence that was criminal at the time of their arrival," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The response was also complicated in places such as the rural period Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the period, no longer blames adults for holding a small amount.
The District Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to refuse all ongoing detention.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time pursuing the law until it changes," he said.
While 55 percent of the colourful desires supported the measures, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the opposite reaction across the state revealed a deep dissatisfaction between local officials in view of this large green experiment.
For periodic prosecutors, it is "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, representing the defendants of marijuana detention, and local spokesperson of the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana laws.
"They spent so much of their life complaining about people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to become a small amount of marijuana into alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best way to become national drug legalization testing cases.
Defenders and state authorities are planning new frontiers for legalised sales and are also eagerly awaiting instructions from the federal government, which is still planned to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
The defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will be elected.
Despite several arrests of marijuana vendors for medical purposes and patients using it, most of the federal government left a trade with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are probably not going to open the door to catch a small drug bag, it is likely that they will oppose the State's possibility of regulated state-approved state-run marijuana-free new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former adviser in the area of the anti-drug policy of President Obama's administration.
Several colorful cities are not waiting for federal authorities to proceed.
Before the election day, some local governments approved moratorium on any new marijuana trade, even if it would take about a year before any trade can be opened.
Last week the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a half-year ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to feel like we're giving someone a license and then we'll have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our vow was to vote against this addition.
We're looking at what the vow voted for, against what the state voted for.
There's really a lot of questions.
Petroella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I was a conservative."
In their opinion, not only today's university students are being attacked.
I don't remember ever having to study at the University of Oxford.
Like my father, my older brother was studying at the university, which I thought was the world's largest thirst for knowledge, a modern-day vengeful Greek symposium that motivated two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, by the end of the 20th century, two weeks after I went to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed my suitcases, and went into the first scandal of my life.
My father broke up and cried.
My friends were confused.
The daily Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I had objections to the love of the students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson said I'd left because I was forced to drink out of my mind.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this rage of supposed enlightenment it was both great and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly established adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I as the proponent of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm pulling it so far.
Just because the latest reports indicate that a new generation of students are suffering from a similar persecution from the middle.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so great that last week, a group of these students demanded the same protection of equal rights as gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Association of Juniors (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and declared not to be welcome".
They demand the creation of a position in the university committee on equal opportunities, which would ensure that their opinions can be freely communicated.
Their situation did not even help the recently mentioned BBC TV documentary Two with the name Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about the student political event that the Conservative has treated as strange and neo-Nazi.
In the series was presented by associate Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) who drove the Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a silver collar on his head.
In other high schools, conservative students say they are treated as "victims".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday's newspaper that "levic influence on universities is growing.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
A 19-year-old student of history at Corpus Christ Samuel Roberts, who is horrified for greater protection, says that such a climate is "unsatisfied", while a 19-year-old elected president of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in accessing members of the JCR to people right from Wednesday there has been a deterioration.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to good living conditions for members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I was born in September 1986, 18 years of age and protected in a shameful way.
The hatred for the Conservative side was the most bitter.
About a year ago, the university voted against the refusal to grant an honorary title to former student Margaret Thatcher for short-term funding of higher education.
From the atmosphere, the Stalinists would also be afraid.
During the first few days of the initial week, when the new students were meeting with each other and with the professors, I got to taste the airport that was supposed to come.
I found that not only do the professors of silence approve of the pep talk of conservative disciples, but they also enjoy their participation.
A policy of mining, privatisation and government resistance to sanctions against apartheid in the South African Republic has been introduced into the wood-covered listeners.
My first lecture was about translating the French text from the 18th century into English and what followed was not prepared for me.
"Mrs. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now retired), "please put in the first paragraph."
I've had enough of this.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a cake cake, was very yellowish.
"Thatcherovs refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students moved.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I propose that you take some basic French lessons in your free time, so if you are not too busy with social matters," said Professor Pitt.
I'm fucked back in my room.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight stabbing on my shoulder.
He was a second-year-old student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the U.S.A.
"I know who you are," he said politely.
Unfortunately, that's how it is.
Anyone who's a conservative is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Most conservatives pretend to be Labourers.
Later in the local house, I tried hard to pretend.
I insisted that I disagree with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be a failure.
A student of the first year of the field of philosophy, politics and economy who (what irony) went to Eton said, "You are a daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was fucked up, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
They're beating each other, aren't they?
I felt how homosexuals must have felt before the sixties' liberal legislation.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet with people like that after seven months?
Should I turn into a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years before me developed as a cleaner of ignorance and isolation.
The only open conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who lived in my college.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's advisor to foreign policy and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He wasn't there.
This place was hated for his province and malignancy and for his contributions to Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he became a professor at the Bilkent University of Turkey in Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started coming from Oxford to my parents' house in London looking for shelter with my uninvited metropolitan friends and families.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his study at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were adopted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreams.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His naked eyes are soaring.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exploited by frequent trips to London, my emotional stamina deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, was under pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week in the course of the course, when another professor of history in general said that I was "enemy of people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was getting a cold inside, I confessed that my "parents washed my brain" and called them "old fools."
The left was only short-lived.
My Oxford career's a scratch on my father's neck.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week to Murdoch News.
My door was locked.
I was walking inside, and after five minutes my persecutors gave it up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a sickly weak man.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and poisoning in the educational institution.
More tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, which not only raised 14 conservative prime ministers, but which is also hiding itself to this day for an undeserved reputation of place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino's more elegant than fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Design", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke to Naty Abascalov, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous Italian designer customers.
Somerset House, former residence Isabelly I. English, is the only place in the British capital to host Valentina Garavanho.
The designer confirmed this at the beginning of the famous retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Design", which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his workshop in the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," she says with her irreplaceable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not have been written without his honourable client.
Valentino was always fascinated by the rare and distant world of Aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which lasts until March 3, rescinds private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important statues, from Princess Salima Aga Chán through the Greek princess Marie-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the simple creek from the town of Vogher in northern Italy to the icon of the international "bohemic trash".
It's not wrong to like the royal family.
"They don't even beat you with cigarettes in a great blanket, as some beautiful pop-music celebrities do," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests have a lot of fun and elegance.
"All of us were very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstaad," explains ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen and close friends of forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino was always more elegant than fame.
And yet there's a star from him."
Valeria Mazzová presents Valentina
The designer's charisma does not even forget the Argentine model Valeria Mazzová.
"It has been many years since we went to him for dinner after a visit to Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything, he was radiant and felt his spirit.
All the calls made him feel importance and love," recalls the top model he started working with during the Paris Week of Top Fashion in 1995.
"He will never get out of fashion, because his designs are artistic works," he says.
A survey of fertility
Gravanio's life is not a story of possession, but of truly repeated love.
He loves people with good upbringing and better titles and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been converted to a very long 70-metre walk that offers an exchange of roles: the visitor is changing into a model and walks the walk to observe the "obesity" of the dreams that Valentine's masterpieces have on him as dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy at her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that was held by Monica Vitti in "Night", or a coat of wool and leather belonging to the Emperor Farah Dibaov.
In the audience there are seven names such as Sibilla Lucemburská, Gloria from Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norská, Rosario Bulharská or Sophie Habsburská.
Naty Abascalová and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like the first love, "can't forget him."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, west "gillette" and jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971 to 1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers.
"I give him in front of the others the preference for his womanhood and great love for women, because he underlines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I like the colors that she uses, they explain a lot and they give a "shine" face.
The proportions are perfect."
Not even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget how Valentina dressed for the first time.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be full and have an opportunity to dress one of her evenings...
She finally arrived at the end of the 1990s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentina for the occasion of a celebration in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was the red dress that had to wear the bells, the scarves, and the tops without the shoulders.
It was a dream that became reality," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax in fashion, his passion is overtime," explains an Italian aristocrat whose life takes place between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's famous dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a file of memories they have in them".
"King" Mode
The gold cemetery exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her wedding with Paul Greece in 1995.
To create these silky clothes of ivory color with all the pearls, twelve types of different landscapes and a four-and-a-half-metre-long wolf, it took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as called the designer of his dress).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority in the specialized press, these dress borders of the top fashion by the end of the 20th century, "return customers from high society".
Valentino, who served as the elite "savor-être" for years, is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest ranking in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and named by the Order of Honor of the Legion gathers as much honor as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention has always attracted his choice, peace, adjusted and perfect view," says Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at the Orsay Museum for gala dinner.
He was at the table with Count Jacqueline de Ribes, my big girlfriend.
He was unusual, time left no trace on him."
When the princess says that...
The world's toughest handle: cheese carriers in the area of Kawah Ijen
Four euros are gambled by carriers in the area of the Indonesian jungle with their lives and health, carrying 70 kilos of cheese down steep stone paths.
There are people whose work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make a living by obtaining cheese from Kawah Ien on the east of the island of Java.
For this reason, every day, it has to be ferryed to the bottom of the crater, where raw gases are avoided from within the Earth, and when contacting the air, it passes into a stable state.
After cutting large blocks of cheese, which together weighs up to 70 kilos, it refers to the shoulder in two bamboo baskets along the sandy stone paths.
At the top of the cane, which is 2 386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes before they arrive at the velvet rate up because they maintain balance and carefully weigh their steps so that they do not slip and fall into ruin.
They know that any confusion could happen to them, as happened to a French tourist who came down from the Kawah Ijen Rock years ago.
Mountainers in Kawah Ien make five cents for every kilo of cheese that they wear
When they are up, they take a journey around tourists who photograph them like monkeys in the circus, and they tirelessly refer heavy baskets to the weight that the laborer placed down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
This is the company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been weighing more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilogram of cheese since 1960.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because it has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of lighters, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar whitening.
"Because we usually carry 70 kilos, we make about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each way," explains Anto to us, who usually completes three trips daily.
One trip takes him three hours and is eventually destroyed, but it can earn 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Even though it appears as a negligible amount for such inhumane efforts, it's a triple of what he would do on the field.
"The daily wages of the miners are very high here. For example, 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day are paid for coffee collection, and two million rupees (167 euros) are paid for fourteen days," explains the carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a sailor.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day and his work was not as heavy, but Anto returned his family to Banyuwang, a village near the jungle, for a serious reason, which is as convincing as the cheese in Indonesia: "I married a young girl from Bala, who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing and his eyes are poisoned by toxic gases.
In his 27 years, Anto three times a day risked his life in the Kawah Ijen Valley, whose cheese has already begun to choose his tax, although his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are poisoned by toxic gases that are avoiding the fungus.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open up my business or study Spanish or French," he promises more than a permanent English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man who is sentenced could be a tourist guide, a Czechman or a receptionist at the hotel, and instead do the work of a carrier.
She shares a dirty wooden chateau with other carriers and every day she wakes up at two o'clock in the morning, because cheese doesn't stop digging at night and her characteristic yellow color changes in blue and black.
Even through the surrounding darkness, Anto shines into the crater and lights up the path of a small light that he has attached to his helmet and bought it for his own money.
About 400 wearers are made on the shoulder basket with cheese from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high income, the demand for raw materials for cost savings has not been mechanised, nor has it provided any equipment to the wearers working on their own hands and with such effort.
In fact, they do not even get a share of 30 000 rupees (EUR 2.5) from the photograph supplement, which together with an entry for 15 000 rupees (EUR 1.2) select natural park observers from tourists who come to photograph the soup and its human mules.
"This job is for profits, not for people," says Madrusin, a 42-year-old state carrier who has been working in Kawah Ien for three decades since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 kilos and assures us that he will continue to work "as long as possible", because he needs money to raise his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retirement, I'm going to die here because the bitch was my whole life.
Although the cheese burns its throat and spits in its eyes when the wind suddenly turns and catches the miners in dense estuaries that come out of the cane, the miners are so insistent that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... but it is obvious from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds caused by the shoulder of the baskets.
In his 53 years of age, the ostrich who weighs his basket on his back can only weigh 50 pounds.
Every day, he and his colleagues pour out 15 tons of cheese, and then three trucks drive the steep road between the cabin into a warehouse in Tamansara, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm dying here because the bitch has been my whole life," says Unainik and opens a wide mouth with a few teeth missing.
Of his five sons, the oldest, thirty years old, he also earns from the laying of cheese.
The time of the gas, but the constant need of one of the world's most difficult rhymes persists from generation to generation - rhymes that perform human mullies in Kawah Ilen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
The Singaporens argue that they have no children, career, stress and cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs growth."
I'm married and I'm the owner, you're my wife and you're the owner.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of advertising on Menthol Bonbons, but - or perhaps just because - the video has spread massively on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
These words are part of the rap that uses local accents of the type "let's blow into the hole" as a smile of the birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to this advertisement in a funny way.
The director of Douglas Hamilton's agency says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people fulfil their "civil duty".
"It's just about the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had to feel it's the theme that we have to touch.
We knew the government was trying a lot of things like expanding perfumes with pheromones or organizing a party.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not quite functional.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can, like making a rap to solve this problem."
1.2 children
Whoever doesn't take it too lightly is a Singaporen government.
He spends $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, prolongs parental leave and provides financial benefits.
But all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its representatives and the strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to population classification is currently 1.2 children per woman.
Lastly, it exceeded the birth rate of value 2, which is considered to be the renewal rate, in 1976.
Why don't the Singaporens actually have more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Committee on Marriage and Family of the National Population Authority, says it is because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"People thus have a wider range of options, with regard to life's goals and priorities, it's not just marriage and family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to the postponement of marriage and child rearing. As a result, the birth rate in Singapore has been reduced.
While there has been a drastic effort within immigration policy to increase immigrants' participation as a measure against a decrease in the number of inhabitants, this has led to insecurity among the locals.
On some Singapore websites it is possible to see hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration has also been seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's government recorded its worst election result from the beginning of independence last year.
After the elections, an effort was made to solve the problem by means of quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unforeseen consequences
While lower birth rates have known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health expenditure and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there have also been some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to have so many small houses.
For example, she began to influence real estate trade.
The City Development Office has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "bot boxes", which can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have great success in the sale.
However, there is a fear that these apartments can support a youthful lifestyle and reflect developers to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers, claims that their "bot boxes" are sold far faster than larger houses.
"They're more popular, and so they sell for days to weeks faster than houses with more expansion.
That's why our money flows are much better."
However, it would admit that the new standards lay down clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules could lead to an increase in the birth rate of the nation, the interview with Singaporeians working in the financial quarter in the city centre suggests that they will not have much effect.
"People are still in stress, homes are expensive, as well as education, so many people are putting it off," says a young official.
"Others have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whatever the government is trying to force citizens to have children, they are also the Singaporeans who have the last word about family establishment.
What is private offline is private and online
Private.
According to the dictionary issued by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is about something of a personal nature or "the area of private life which every right has to protect against any violation".
What is privacy for a person under 16 years of age?
How does this definition apply in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the danger he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet things that he would certainly not tell anyone in ordinary communication?
Newspapers from ElPeriodico spoke to five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as "something entirely personal" in a personal level and as "user's name and password", if it was a social network.
"I wouldn't disclose my greatest secret," said ten-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's a very secret secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I give nice pictures or pictures to the FB as we play.
I'm also talking to my acquaintances.
I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or a picture that would make someone laugh," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish abstract photos, photos of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine Twitter supporters.
Most of them are related.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I have set up a Twitter account so that I can express my views and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone's gonna answer me, I'm just giving them there," he adds.
"The social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or fast communicating with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even be interested in recommending someone unknown.
The case of fourteen-year-old José is different.
This teenager owns his own accounts on the Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and at the last mentioned network he admits that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them put him to anything, nor did he want an address or phone number.
"If they insisted on me or demanded it from me, it was simply by removing it from their account," he admits.
José applied to Ask after reading his recommendation on Twitter.
Tomuto boys are not foreign experiences with what is today called cyberbullying.
"A friend of mine on the social network was kicked out.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
According to José, the victim didn't get out of the account.
"You just activated a private regime."
Then he explains a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of someone known in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I'd do it if someone cared or just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and graduate in the field of education and education, believes that children and adolescents in social networks need to understand that the main purpose of these networks is to inform them.
He says: "The Internet has come up as a means to search for information, but when the social network has emerged, the rules of the game have changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, graduate of pedagogic at Yale University and author of the article Digital Natives and Digital Migrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are only learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we ask them to know what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, on the contrary, when they are not yet mature".
Also, to be - as far as the environment is concerned - considerate, at a time when what she wants most is to be loved, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," she adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and teenagers what is private, asking questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do anything doesn't work," he adds.
Furthermore, Marrielos Porras mentions some of the options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to share your photo with you?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you mark people on photos of the festival, did you ask these people for permission?
And yet another: Does everyone need to know what you're doing?
Another point is to realize that they have to behave in the Internet just as much as they do outside.
Those are the same rules.
"A person runs outside the Internet with respect, morality and other principles and should be the same on social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, teacher at the first level, and education counselor, explains that it is necessary for parents to read the rules of social networks carefully.
"If they understand every misunderstanding, they have a good basis for talking to their children about the consequences that an online account can have.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule "not to talk to other people".
The South American Summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The 6th Presidential Union Summit of the South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without the Lima Declaration, which was announced and allegedly signed by the seven current presidents.
The Efe Agency has repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unassur organization, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also the Presidential Offices, who at the beginning determined that the document will be published after the summit, have indicated that it will be published later on the Peruvian Government's website.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanto Humal in a few short press statements.
The press had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the discussion, a video from the presidential meeting was broadcast in the press room without a sound with a message of "confidential session, the transmission of the sound is banned".
A small amount of information that journalists had available was provided by press speakers from some governments who were present, not by Peruvian speakers.
The only document published during the conference was the list of participants with the presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from different national and international media to be excluded from asking for more information.
Later, the Peruvian Presidential Office sent an e-mail with a "confidential declaration" from the summit, but it was only about President Humaly's statement, not about the official document that the summit closed.
Last October, the third summit of the South American and Arab countries (America del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) was held in Peru, and even on this occasion the Lima Declaration was not originally announced, although the press was demanding.
On official ASPA pages, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure transmission for all journalists, but they completely restricted the flow of information.
The Summit ended, among other things, with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
President of Peru Ollanta Humala and President of Chile Sebastian Piñera met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin on Monday with the hearing of the defence talks by both sides to discuss the dispute that started with Lima against Santiag.
"We will get together and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute we are discussing today at this international court," President Humala said with his Chilean opponent.
" Chile has been, is and will be a country respecting international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," Piñera added and greeted President Humalu with a handhold on the flags of both countries.
The two Presidents' confirmation that the International Court of Justice's decision was subject was published after Colombia adopted the Bogotá Pact this week, stating that the international court's judgment on the maritime borders with Nicaragua was completely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Roseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from the organization of Unassur in 2011 following the resignation of then President Fernando Luga and did not attend the meeting.
Hosting President Ollant Humala was entrusted with the launch of early speeches and the wedding of the summit in Lima shortly after the afternoon.
The President read out a final document informing him that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 projects were planned between South American countries, with an investment of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, the Member States of UNASUR will take "significant steps towards a goal in the form of a South American citizen, which will extend the agreements on residence".
He reported that actions are supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, to improve the availability of drugs and cheap internet in all parts of South America and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, "there is no economic consolidation (Latin America) of a victorious nature, but it should serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport links between different locations in South America, especially rural and border areas... to make our countries better connected and create new economic ties," the Peruvian President said in a reading speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects relate to Peru and its southern axis from the coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to a better connection with Ecuador, but he did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its return to the South American Union," from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues that the summit raised was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area, which is solid and has good neighbourly relations.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation at a regional meeting that he hoped that he would meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to discuss with respect the International Court of Justice's judgment on the dispute about the maritime border, which is dubious to Bogotá.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We discuss all the solutions, none of them are excluded, not a deal with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope that I will be able to tell President Ortega that we will conduct the most civilized and inconclusive manner," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they will participate in the inauguration of dark President Enrique Peña Niety.
Within the framework of the Summit, EU Defence Ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the area of defence.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter countries are currently excluded.
Peru is the provisional chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn to integrate from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America must, in this case, really learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on State TV Peru that Europeans "killed for the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now there are practically one government".
In this sense, the project for the establishment of a South American citizen supported by the Member States of the organization of the Unasur has been covered.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andean Community, however, there are still areas of return which want to bring us back to the past," he said.
Among other things, the Ecuadorian President expressed his agreement with the regrouping of the Organization of American States (OAS) provided that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States would be reduced and those signatories to the San José Covenant on Human Rights would be taken into account.
"Those who are in the front are never committed to anything, and we the South Americans are going to sign everything.
It is understandable that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights is funded by the United States in Washington," said Ecuador's founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange in an appeal to political asylum.
President Correa confirmed that he did not violate this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be issued to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticised the Swedish judge who asked him to be interrogated in the Swedish territory for a alleged sexual offence, while "own Swedish law allows him to conduct the interviews with a videoconferencing call that could be carried out from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since what's on our embassy, but the embassy informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
"But he threatens to worsen his physical and mental condition because he is locked in a small space without the possibility of moving in the fresh air.
That would mark everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the resolution of Assange's asylum since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of permission to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks had been held with London to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón runs a series of proceedings at various European institutions," he said.
He said, "If Britain leaves tomorrow, it's all over."
And if Mr. Assange's Sweden is hearing from the Ecuadorian embassy in London or through Skype, how does this without any problem enable dark legislation and how it has already been implemented in other cases, this problem will be solved tomorrow."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and explained that he certainly does not tolerate "injustice, wrong intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
We are not the biggest enemies of the free press, we are bad and corrupt politicians, but the bad journalists in profit, pressure and extortion services," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy at the fact that neither journalists, "bankers, Hegemonian countries nor bourgeoisie do not control Ecuador", and said that if it is re-elected, "it will continue in the changes led by the right direction and direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed in Paraguay regarding membership in the Union of Unasur at least in its next elections and argued that the whole "must be firm and tolerate opportunism and pukism rooted in legality", because in fact "has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian President stated that he considered it "very appropriate" to negotiate with his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time following the judgement of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which decided in favour of Nicaragua.
At the moment, judgment is not accepted.
"It's a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to step together.
It is necessary to assess the scope to be overcome and it was possible to move forward."
He also expressed hope in the settlement of the dispute on the maritime border, which is settled at the same trial of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international authorities if both countries undertake to take judgment, whatever the case may be."
In connection with the possibility of running in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to be held in the third term of office, he noted that he sees this option as "with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa said that if the election in February 2013 loses, she will leave public life.
"I have never been very interested in myself personally, but the unfair situations, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I win, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
When we lose, it's the same with me.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Madur, who says that President Chávez went to scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
It's not about reinstatement in the president's health," he explained.
The Heads of State of Ecuador today participated in the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur), which was led by calls for greater regional integration with a view to maintaining development, equality and security.
Victims of AIDS are the result of late diagnosis today
Fabrizi was 21 years old when his test confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if lightning hit me," he says in memories of the moment of truth that the doctor was trying to "a little calm down", but obviously without success.
The boy kept it secret in front of his family.
He decided to take his illness to his own stomach and start to inform himself about it, with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43th birthday.
This is undoubtedly one of the most recent HIV patients in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several fights with diseases.
Fabrizio has been living with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was something unimaginable at the beginning of the 1990s, when there was much doubt, little treatment options and greater stigma.
At that time, neither the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) nor the director of the clinic, "because he had a severe wound".
Back then, having AIDS was a synonym for death.
Now it's possible to survive and live with this syndrome.
However, there are many people who do not know and come to know about their disease until the virus has caused damage to the body and sent out the immune system, and then they become the victims of accidental infections.
31 years from the time of AIDS in the world, or at least from the first documented cases, "it is a great success that the life of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, who confirmed this information in April of this year in prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and specialist for HIV/AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that survival and life expectancy depend on the degree of immunosuppression of the immune system of patients diagnosed with disease, and are better at those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that the person diagnosed with HIV for 25 years can, according to these findings, "live without problems for up to 75 years", explained the doctor in the interview.
To emphasize this progress, it is worth noting that the average life span of the Mexicans is today 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years and, in Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients have died since the AIDS outbreak.
Only in the state of Jalisco died 255 people in 2011 and by this year's May 187. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
- Why do people still die from disease?
- "I don't think there's a problem with access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we haven't exhausted the stocks of drugs. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they don't know the condition of the disease, or in the late stage of the disease."
He adds: "Nine out of ten patients come when some associated infection is already present. The only thing we need to do to be able to influence the overall mortality is to diagnose the disease before, and therefore it is necessary to offer large-scale tests to detect the disease to all those who ask for it."
In his proposal, experts and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio who came to have tests in a private laboratory only because he did so by his friend, and even through his low age, he had already contracted AIDS and suffered from Kaposi’s sarcoma, a cancer disease, which is one of the common complications.
"Everything will change when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're dying, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm about to die, I'd rather get three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, health, exercise, taking drugs."
To this day, his parents know only that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone.
I work, I have a lot of activity, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but responsiblely, I pay attention to myself and to another person," Fabrizio, who has accepted a call to share her experience with the newspaper MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate today, within the framework of World AIDS Day, to witness those who fear.
"Let them do their tests. If they're at risk, let them know first if they're HIV positive, it's better. And if they're already diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message contains the password of battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the desktop
Among health programs and ordinary citizens is a major failure, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who is finding information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, one or two were given us before, today they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
They are among the most prone to new diseases.
"What do you want?" is a common question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, medical staff and medical staff who are trying to avoid teenagers, says the reporter.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution, so that condoms are not only behind the counters, but hundreds of them in the public toilets, in places where young people often walk.
"It's not the support of promiscuity.
They are not even "paying beer and motel", as Governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether he would agree with the distribution of condoms in his period.
It is not sexuality. It is best to access condoms to those who are already leading a sexual life," he noted.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS cases and 1,317 HIV cases).
This position in Mexico represents the fourth place in new and detected AIDS cases and 13 places in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection is sexually transmitted, 6% of the bloodstream and 2% perennially.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are four to five people who do not know about the disease in one registered case.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Justice, which does not recognise the restructuring of Group Vitro’s debt established by the Mexican competition, creates a bad precedent for any national firm with branches in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
It therefore appears that the restructuring procedures for companies that provide for Mexican laws do not apply in the country of roads and stars despite international agreements.
The adoption of the judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harline Halem at the Texas North Court of Competition leaves no defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the river El Bravo.
However, the judgment opens the main Mexican producer of glass to the Supreme Court of the United States with an appeal against three inequalities.
The opening statement should be made that while the judge of this case claims that the creditors are to be governed by the insolvency law of the United States, the Court of Justice of the Fifth Period with its seat in New Orleans says that the main proceedings provide for a competition procedure in Mexico.
First, this would indicate the ignorance of international process cooperation in the event of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
For this purpose, a United Nations Model Law for the Union of International Trade Law was created, which the arbitrator designates the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that, without the vote of the branch of the internal business structure, when the debt of the parent company to the branch of Vitro is recognised, the required majority would not be reached for the approval of the restructuring.
However, this possibility is permitted by Mexican laws.
The fact is that Vitro’s case was not the first one in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples here, such as Agrimex and Commercial Mexican, for which the Federal Competition Institute has been responsible.
In addition, it is true that even after the votes of the supporters were read out, the believers - who opposed Vitro in the United States, i.e. the funds of the "soups", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited - did not reach the majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent by 37.
This particular shall not be taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, Vitro is guilty of a difficult situation that has been facing since 2008 - in the background of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family company González Sady will appeal for a new judgment directly before the Court of Appeal so that the hearing will take place in full participation, i.e. in the participation of five judges, because they initially voted only three.
If it fails here, it will be required as a remedy for the revision of the proceedings of the higher courts, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In this case, it is serious that the Court referred to the document sent by the Mexican Government as the service of amicius curiae, in which the proceedings of Vitro are detailed in the framework of the Competition Act and in which it is pointed out that the company has facilitated its compliance with the agreements signed by both countries in order to confront the law in question with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
In addition, it points out that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, which are the rules for international insolvency cases which guarantee equality for both debtors and creditors.
Opportunity on both sides: punishment for Vitro and state.
Overall assessment
A few months ago, a criminal notice was made on the table by the Mexican Air Force Committees against the former owner of Gaston Azcarrag Andrade, who was appointed from the sub-contracting and, according to the company’s pilot organisation, had already passed.
The court in charge of Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just appealed to the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing the achievement of justice.
According to it, the supervisory authority systematically refused to report to the Attorney-General of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this company, in which it selected 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexico Air Force F/589 from Bank IXE.
Mediations were probably aimed at buying professional hotel management (Administrator Professional de Hotels).
As we know, Azcarrag Andrade is a majority shareholder of Posadas hotels.
Dragon Mart's Betting
A group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of the association met on the weekend in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge shopping and distribution centre with products from "land with a large wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area for employees from 150 companies in the lower part.
Previously, the Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industry de Transformación) has been able to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to stand against the monumental area, which would in part destroy protected areas and represent the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of proceedings with ACTA
The request of the Senate, which the government did not know and requested an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador of the Trade Agreement against counterfeiting, known under the ACTA short term, signed in Japan by the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Méxicano de la Propiedad Industrial) failed to update.
As we know, it has happened in spite of the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility to consider it to be a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term horizon
In an attempt to pay off long-term debts and do not affect those short-terms, Homex provides an investment certificate for 500 million pesos.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball world runner Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was involved in this saloon sport for more than 60 years and was processing the whole world thanks to him.
Few people in Puerto Rico have memories of the history of local basketball, such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before he was put on a wheelchair in 2008 burned to this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player in younger categories, a national basketball league BSN player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league, or president of the Puerto Rican basketball federation.
"I stood up during my life in basketball, including several at the same time, as when I was the president of the BSN National League, the general actor of the national team and the president of the federation," Reyes reminded reporters of Primera Hora at her home in Bayamón, where she has been living with Isabel for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes in his claim not to pass.
His home, which is almost all decorated with photos and memoirs from his long career, proves this.
Bayamón in the Heart
With the greatest appeal of all the guards, those who recall his actions in Los Vaqueros from the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, at the same time celebrating 15 years as co-owner or team owner.
"It was my best summer, the one I used most because I had the opportunity to take part with the Los Vaqueros team since 1967 in eight championships, whether as the owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one of the champions - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy was in the BSN.
At that time, the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," said Reyes.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was here earlier as a coach and then acting at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me, "I have an adult two-metre player for you.
You want him?"
And it was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gaussian player who became a team member and one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy brings Bayaman's victory to the championship, Gauss will contribute to another."
The championship, when the Vaqueros team played Gauss, took advantage of it, but it was only far away because in 1988 he was already acting as president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his duties and to use Mincy's location on the national team.
"I remember how we first defeated the United States in the 1989 qualifying Olympics in Mexico.
Then came the World Championship in 1990, where we ended the fourth, but we should have had the bronze not to be the Canadian judge who let us repeat the final launch," Reyes said.
Is the world championship team in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who beat Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991 when we won gold and blew up the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that broke our bronze into the world's championship.
This team had not only Mincy, Gaussian, Ramona Rivase, Fica López and "Piculina" (Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 for knee injury.
The team, which may not have had the perfect composition, but managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was the team of the Olympic Qualifications in 1995 in the Argentine Neuquén.
With players on the list such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and Junior player Rolando Hourruitiner who replaced the players excluded because of the raid in the Panamanian games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rica's best player?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
None of the Puerto Ricans reached this level of results such as Piculin.
Not about his behavior in different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good generation of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmatia and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arilla's job very much from young people.
What success in the federation do you think is the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous age of national team in 1988-1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s, the BSN National League had one season to 17 men.
What couldn't you prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce as a division of youth categories by regions.
For example, Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national play-offs.
Now children travel a lot and play too much games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits of compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, decision makers and decision makers.
I'm so glad.
What are you talking about now?
The more I listen to music, I watch YouTube videos with music from my time, I use my grandkids and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And, of course, I'm using my wife Isabel, who's always been on my side.
The actor Larry Hagman died
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, declared to the world the main role of John Rosse Ewing, known as "J.R." in the Dallas television series, in which he inspired a man who acted impartially and was final and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as a dreary oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the Dallas television series became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died according to an official family announcement provided by the Associated Press production company Dallas Warner Bros on Friday afternoon to the cancer-related complications.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role he loved most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time he died in a Dutch hospital," said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, beautiful, fun, nice, kind and talented and will miss me so much for him.
He was unique and lived his life full," Linda Gray said in her announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he had a malignant tumor on his liver, and Hagman underwent transplants.
Years before the broadcast of the Dallas series, Hagman celebrated himself as a decent man in a distant comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC station from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life will change when he meets the attractive girl Barbara Eden playing and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies, which were only briefly broadcast, and was The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
Its effect in films included roles that were well-adjusted by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was until Hangman's Master's performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the star peak.
The CBS drama show about the Ewings clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan "Who shot Jaijar?", which was supposed to cause expectations about the work of full emotion, when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of spectator speculations around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in betting offices.
This also helped to achieve a record in monitoring.
The November 1980 part, in which the answer was revealed, watched 41 million television shows on average. Dallas became the second most popular show of history after the end of the series MASH in 1983, which watched 50 million viewers.
On J.R., his brother-in-law, Kristin, shot Mary Crosby.
Kristin and J.R. were pregnant, and then he threatened to label her a prostitute if she didn't leave the city.
Hagman played Ewing, an unsatisfied chamois with charismatic smile: an aggressive businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in the hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
There should be, "There's an honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered on Friday the Hagman as someone who was "great on the payroll and out of it".
It is unforgettable and irrevocable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who should have known and loved him.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series broadcast the TNT station several months ago with great success.
"The film was completed in five parts of the second row and the sixth was just turning," the television station reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT station about how the series will continue.
A family from Fort Worth in Texas was the son of Mary Martin's actress and singer, who stared in classical works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she bore Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman, in 1931.
Early in the 1950 ’ s, Larry tried to be happy at the theater stage in New York and then served in England in the summer of 1952 to 1956.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelson, who married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and for a long time they lived in the California city of Malibu, where they lived a lot of celebrities.
In 2001 he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything there that I knew could harm or harm someone," said Press Association.
After liver transplantation, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped God - fearing patients.
"I do them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a bit unpleasant for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that examines "the end of the world"
Every week, students study apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course at the end of the world, he knew that it was an insurmountable lever: the end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar, which is due to come on 21 December, many people were caught as evidence that the end of the world is coming.
Charm, however, had no idea what was waiting for him in the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane of Sandy, the budget failure that some call "debt Armageddon", and the growing conflict that Israel is in, the place in which Christians who are theorizing about the end of the world will begin.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most incapacitated semester he ever was," Charm told students this week at Rutgers University in Camden in New Jersey.
When you figure out what's going on in the world today, as if we had 30 days left, it's really a good time.
And remember, bad means for apocalyptic thinking good.
And it's not the only professor offering courses about "the end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Barry Vucker is an expert assistant in the course of the Middle Ages, Culture and the End of the World.
Every week, students study apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We choose why these ideas are expanding over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, it can blow up a war.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and examine how they differ from real life examples.
"I have tried to inform my students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," says Vucker.
In the main campus State University of Pennsylvania, professor of Latin American history Matthew Restal and his colleague Amara Solari, expert assistant in art history and anthropology were given together to organize a course with the simple name End of the world.
"We don't add "2012," because we always calculate with the possibility of reorganizing the course in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite "dangerous loss", students must study, create projects and do final tests.
On Penn State, the final test will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not give students a chance to work "until the expected end of the world by evening," Restall said.
Courses have become quite popular.
"He grew up in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-average students, who applied 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received an e-mail asking if it was still a place.
The students themselves make sure the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said at Rutgers University in Camden, 23-year-old Bridged Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
And so apocalyptic, worldly, or religious thought is just a question of comfort or its absence.
Will Weekes, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of an hour that could teach," he said.
"I enjoy it."
But no professed student, so the professor didn't say he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project was discussing the Maya prediction and we're going to throw it away in a way," said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student at the University of Temple from West Chester.
"Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that spans a few centuries back, which people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The spread of these speculations caused the Internet.
"Somewhere people don't think about it," he said.
This is how it happens in the absolute majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew about some course of "the end of the world", he answered quickly.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he wrote and pointed out an exception at the highest office.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years it was about many days of the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people will start to think immediately about the next date" or to philosophy that December 21st is the beginning of the seven-year period at which the world will end.
The date is taken at easy weight by students and professors.
Several of them said they were going to celebrate "the end of the world."
"I'll probably call a few friends to laugh together," explained a 20-year student of Samira Ford communication.
