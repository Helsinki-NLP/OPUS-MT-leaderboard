Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
US President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to face the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma and the medal and a check of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will come tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Nordic metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The president's couple then arranged a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestigious prize.
He receives this as the fourth U.S. President, but only as the third one who takes the price directly from the office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the war of Afghanistan when the price is taken over.
The President does not want to get rid of this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently leading the war in two countries.
He has stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics has forgotten to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Golmedaille, the Diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to contribute for charity purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charity work.
The event programme then features a banquet with the President and his wife, with the exception of the Prime Minister and the Queen of Norway and 250 other guests being present.
Obama was very withholding from the price from the beginning.
For example, he claimed that he felt that he did not deserve the price.
He also repeated several times that the price is not only for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that this was a "action order" for him.
Natural Protector is accused of repression
The leadership police accused the president of the Association of Citizens of the "Natural Protection Community of Leitmeritz" of repression.
In several cases he filed appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he called for money from the investors for his favor, said the chief police spokesman, Alena Romova.
The president of the Leitmeritz-Natural Protection Community, Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in jail and he's threatened with a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting container in Brünn don't smell good
In Prague, people can sort the drinking packages, in the south-western villages you will find the sorting garbage containers again on a step-by-step.
And in Brünn?
There you had to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate dust tones.
I do not want to say that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But I would like to know whether the Council members are not sufficiently concerned about this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the waste separations in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics, but above all by the number of tons of dust for such waste.
Have they ever tried to remove the PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
This is just art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found so far by chance is the mare place against the affected gans.
Mr Onderka should not make us angry with his colleagues, but that is too little for me.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is not a honeycomb in other parts.
That's why many of my friends don't even like to sort out the waste.
Out of nowhere.
It is too far away for them.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles after the festival.
But on the Konicova street, I have not seen any paint powders in sight.
Luckily, I came to the right place on the road.
But the garbage was almost gone.
This is still the centre of Brunn, where the whole city is represented, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics are likely to freeze the source socialists.
You'd rather buy the city an ice hockey league that makes us ashamed all over the Republic, instead of buying a few tons more and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner well.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance also with official statistics after looking for a time on the Internet.
According to the ECO-KOM company, Brunn is really the worst in the South Sea area.
The "Parubek" budget has deducted the money for rent and sickness
After the left-wing party gave more money to farmers and officials in spite of the government's view, there is no more money in the budget for rent, sickness and building savings.
But also not for public debt or international court disputes.
This causes even more problems that will be in the government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists implemented the salary increase for some groups, they calculated that the government would pay the money for sensitive expenditures, old-age pensions or for the health pay. "This is only a delay in the problems in the future, mines," Janota says.
Of the loans, much more and more interest is being paid, and money has to be refunded at some point.
Too much for the choice, where to take the cash box is empty.
If social benefits or costs are not reduced for the public sector, the tax shall be increased.
For all those who gave more money to the Left Party: the firearm, the teachers, the farmers.
And later on for her children.
In order for the pensions or sickness money lost 1.8 billion of their account, people need not be afraid to get this money.
But for the price that the state owes itself even more - in the next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state fund, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will increase more and more quickly and, together with this, the costs and interest.
The State will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity allowance, as the government had done in its counter-intelligence package.
Because of the cash flow in favour of some polling groups, there will also be five billion missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
This is mainly the sections which have been won in competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly passed on.
Best of all, get what's not free.
This means delaying or setting up thirty large construction works, it is also at risk of European money creation, warns the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it will solution the flow of money in Solomonically - it will attack the CEZ shareholders in which the state is the owner of the Majority and then spend the money on the Transport Fund.
The problem is that the level of dividends is never safe and it is not an infinite source.
The previous year, 18 billion of CEZ flow into the budget.
Every year, dividends are paid out of environmental damage, the pension account is filled out, and this money is also used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
Moreover, according to EU rules, this trick increases the actual budget deficit at the level of 5.7% of GDP.
But this does not end the carnival of revolutions.
Almost three billion fell in the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and for crimes or for costs for the judicial dispute, even for building.
If the state passes without this money, it's not safe.
It's just a lucky game.
If we lose an international dispute, then we have to pay it anyway, Janota makes clear.
The Minister then has to save the money from the ressources or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing for the already launched two-billion-dollar project "State Fund", which should allow on-line monitoring for what individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project had to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans count for the future with a phone on which the user can switch a single key between different operating systems by pressing.
The plans presented look promising.
It's enough to just press one key, and from Windows Mobile becomes in less seconds in Android exchange.
This is exactly what the U.S. company VMware wants to present, focusing primarily on the development of virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to run two user profiles on the phone at the same time.
They can switch between these, they can divide them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, expressed by Srinavas Krishnamurti from the company VMware during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time several days ago.
The market will come in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully run the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory on which at the same time the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems were delivered.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware works together with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and is expected to arrive at the customer within 2012.
Snow shortages on the mountains spring the hotel owners
Skeelless slopes do not only worry about the inhabitants of Giant Mountains.
The lack of snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
This is why you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter periods including Christmas and Silver.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, fix the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether, in our opinion, this year's Christmas party will be on snow or "matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, started.
Anyone who wants to stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Whoever prefers saving and where the quality of the stay comes first in second place, who can try to wait a few more days.
The spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for the Silver Day.
I think they'll be trying to sell them for a long time, but then they also have to give them up, and they'll be in a little bit less.
And then the free rooms will run fast, Jandura estimated.
Free beds at all winter dates always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some more affordable Christmas stays for the last moment, led by the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvester day in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi travel agency, but here there are less free places.
Good paragraph also finds the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter periods are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stays is also adversely affected by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks are cut within a week, the Christmas will also be sold out, I think.
In return and something better than last year it is possible to occupy the rooms in the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We're about five percent better than last year.
On the Silver Day and at Christmas we only have a few more free rooms.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec-hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is located at the central park in Janske Lazne, 80 percent for the Silvester stay.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain open at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne for Christmas.
We were pleased to be surprised this year of January, for which we are already occupied by about 60 percent.
A bit weaker is in the middle of February, but when the snow comes, interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains is certainly increasing, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, led.
On a larger snow protection, the giant mountain hotel owners are currently waiting.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes down, it should be on the mountains snow.
But then again a warmer will come, Jiri Jakobsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Rehearsal is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical, with what student zeal Barack Obama, the president with his reputation as the expert, repeats his predecessor's strategy in the Afghanistan question, which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
Finally, when he expanded his ambitious Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had written it about the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only in the text itself, he repeatedly used the type of speech "as in Iraq", he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward" without getting mad.
Even three years ago, he criticised Bush's idea of sending fresh troop quotas to Iraq in the civil war - as "unresponsible and carastrophic decision" in its consequences.
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, which came from military recommendations, was the only possible and so successful that today's news about Iraq is no longer speaking.
The call Bushs was not improved by this, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
In order to raise the troop quota, the military again asked him, especially the commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordinating practices, strongly criticised the attractive shields in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to turn the situation around for better.
The President took three months, but he did not come up with a better idea, and thus he had engaged in the general gain of 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has made the commitment for another 5,000, even though he originally calculated at least 10,000.
The most problematic thing about the whole Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the semi-suppression will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the Brotherly War of recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well structured, its leaders honour the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the counterindication - it is not possible to rely on anyone and no agreements will be held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces who are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, although formally founded, remain only shanks, after which patriarchal relations will continue to prevail.
The disparity between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the inconsistencies of the conditions that further complicate Pakistan and Iran.
The creation of a "actionable state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama strategy foreigned by its volunteerism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and is now at the edge of the explosion.
It is believed that the little soldiers who have broken into the cry of war over the "early return" here create a miracle can only be a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will take it as the indirect intention of the US defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europe's willingness to take part in the fights in Afghanistan is at stake.
Europe's politicians can and will not explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindukush-Gebergsvorland.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continue to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not affect the United States, it is a very difficult question for the United States whether the problem is not solved by troops.
This question must be answered in the period when America moves to Obama to take the victory from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation patch for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain until the presidential election, and thus there remains enough time for him to catch up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total waste.
The manager of the Bank Goldman Sachs no longer gets bonus bonus in bar
The leading executives of the U.S. Goldman Sachs Bank no longer receive premium bonuses this year.
This has been announced by the company, which reacts to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of money that can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from the managers if they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters Agency, is working towards the goal of connecting Wall Street's premium bonds with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs turned to the target disc of criticism after she had contributed almost $17 billion for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonds over the course of this year will probably exceed 20 billion dollars even after the agency Reuters.
The high premiums in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
On Wednesday, Britain reported that it intended to charge the bankers' bonus of over 25,000 pounds once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year women have won the Nobel Prizes in all trades except physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf took over the Nobel Prizes this year in the professional and literary categories.
In addition to the four scientists, among them were the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her countryman Jack Szzotak for research in the chromosome field.
The price for chemistry has been obtained by Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, to clarify the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only class in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have contributed to the CCD chip invention, which is the basis for all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel Prize and the certificate of the acquisition of the money prize.
It consists of ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prizers in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
According to tradition, American President Barak Obama has already received the most expected Nobel Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
He has acknowledged in his speech the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the top of the country leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the retreat. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives early Friday the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his stay in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the State budget for the following year in the form that was released by the Parliamentary Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the state deficit is too high, which also deepens the public finances crisis.
The meeting was briefed by the President, Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday about his further stay in his office.
Under the budget law, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should finance a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament agreed on the left-wing proposals for money change and increased the money for civil servants, for the maintenance of social services and direct wages for farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that it is covering up the budget deficit.
The left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other hand, has created a sharp internal political dispute, which is why the question mark arises about the further work of the Fisheries Office, on which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, has practically been liquidated the package of savings measures implemented by the Fisheries Government in autumn and that, in their understanding, the State debt should be terminated.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to, said today in the debate with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected for a long time the "serious problem", the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion there is no better solution today.
An improvement could only lead to a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is gross and that the government should consider its further existence.
The President of the ODS, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the Office with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
Premier Fischer described words similar to "strong statements" in the editorial.
The CSSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the state deficit was grey, that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and exceeded the 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD evaluated the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeatable" of the world shows much from the country, from its struggle and victory despite some critics, that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, race relationships and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless struggle against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life story the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the one-and-a-half-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I'm gonna have to meet you.
The two-and-a-half-year-old actor who had won the prize for his role in the Eastwood Drama from the boxing section "Million Dollar Baby" was already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which he became the slave holder, a fictional president of the United States, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but only rarely anyone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was in prison for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was released in 1990 and was president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeatable", and at the same time is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak.
The film describes a real event in which Nelson Mandela joined his forces with the Captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can agree with his people through the sport, so he decides to agree with the back players who belong to the outside world.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role as closely as possible to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The greatest challenge was of course to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, eat with him at night and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I've found that if I shake your hand, I take your energy, it'll be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you're feeling, he said.
For me, it is important to become another person.
Matt Damon is the captain of the national backup team in the film François Pienaar, where the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hardback world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met a pioneer in his house.
I remember when I sounded at the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'In the film I look much bigger'.
Despite the obvious differences in the status of actors compared to their actual examples, he has received positive reviews under the direction of Director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeatable" and is also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his evaluation in the following words: "It was a very good story, a very well-managed film."
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invicus has received 76 percent positive reviews.
Dissolved light secret about Norway: The Russians have tested a rocket
About Norway a special light effect was to be observed of unknown origin.
Only yesterday did the Russian Ministry of Defence agree that around the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile has been tested.
But the start was not successful again and the rockets called "Bulava" type, which should be originally the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the alpine dream of the Russian generality as well as Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site at the rocket test did not have a positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has usually not been started or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers it's already written about "Bulava" as a "rocket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights
This 13th attempt was done at the beginning of normal.
Once the flight is completed, technical damage has occurred on the rocket.
Probably the engine exploded in the third rocket phase.
This time "Bulava" started from the atom-U-boat Dmitrij Donskij, which drove under the water of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the exit from the U-boat.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over the north roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, since the first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that this is a Russian missile.
This time, the generality has maintained itself and has claimed that it is not possible to speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test started without error, the management of the Ministry of Defence only holds six out of thirteen for failure.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even ten hypersonic atomic heads with a total weight of not more than 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with the Cska Moscow at 51 years of age
The legendary opponent Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself again at 51 years of age in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup owner is helping his team Cska Moscow in need, and is probably already taking part in the Friday goal of KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who has completed his career for forty years, in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we urgently need another opponent.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need some other formalities to clarify, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergey Nemcinov.
It is not clear at this time whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect a game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can lift the morals of other partners, joined Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice surface, he will become the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game according to AP.
In the NHL, the legendary stormer Gordie Howe has played a whole season for Hartford for fifty years and was able to subscribe 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, and won in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also collected successes in the NHL, where in Detroit-Dress he twice picked up the Stanley Cup over his head.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Ice hockey Star Room.
Hyundai left the trade unions. All overhours will be cancelled
The management of the Nosovice Automobile Factory Hyundai agreed with the trade union to abolish all overtime.
Because of frequent overtime, the trade union announced the strike preparation on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesperson of the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
The management, however, wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday's report this week.
We must not abandon our production plan, which is a principle, so it was proposed on Saturday, 19 December, on the basis of voluntary overtime, that two work stories would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work on Saturday.
The staff will also receive it in the wake of the Saturday night on 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime allowance or they can take a leave of absence on December 28th and thus extend the Christmas holiday, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of Saturday's layer are paid the driver's fee and lunch.
In view of the fact that the overtimes of the most urgent and burning point were regarding the demands and complaints of the trade unions who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the abolition of all overtime for December, Vaněk said.
The employees of the car factory were forced to work almost every day until last week after eight hours.
With the signing of the Agreement, the staffing of the trade unions shall be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unions will take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they will be ready to cancel the strike.
The situation in the car factory was seen last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees were spontanely stretching because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged scandals.
On the other hand, the management felt that employees had to make overtime to comply with the automotive supply requirements.
The trade union officers also called for no sanctions to be imposed on employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the field of overtime, trade unions are calling for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, this year they demand the payment of 5000 kroner.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The series production was launched in the company last November.
Up to this September, about 80,000 vehicles have been manufactured, which currently has 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that also works with 'counterfeited' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new connections to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main benefit of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the connection to common viral variants does not work as strongly as one of the existing medicines.
AIDS cannot be cured yet.
Patients may be able to prolong their life and prevent the growth of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of the virus increase has the development of so-called resistance to which medicines are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with the virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metallic carborene affect the protein responsible for increasing the HIV virus.
The metal carbs are compounds of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in different ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists have achieved new 'improved' connections prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus protein.
The metal carbs have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-faceted cages consisting of drilling, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Domestic and Persistent Virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there would be no mature infection virus particles.
When we turn off HIV protease, we also turn off the increase of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Scientific Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a whole series of connections in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which will then be systematically modified.
A bit weaker, but more reliable
The effects of this series of substances against HIV protease were tested in the reagent glass, including against their persistent (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalcarbone on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as on the medicinal products used in clinical use, but does not lose its effect on the resistance variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, makes the metal carbs interesting links for further research on the development of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Budget dispute. ODS went off on Fischer, who's resisting
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, referred to the approved budget for the following year as "gray" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its continued existence.
The opinion of the ODS was referred to by the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It is likely time for the analysis.
The Vice-President of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Office with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party apparently no longer works.
According to Necas, the President-in-Office has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to combating the growing deficit or whether he intends to stay in the office with the help of Parliament's links.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problems of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, but with a link-party amendment of more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased money for civil servants, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The Government has opposed the proposals of social democracy to the fact that it is covering the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to operate with a balance of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has complied with the Government's request, because the amended budget is also only a minor variant of the budget.
Disappointment and insensitivity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota has talked about his disappointment and a feeling of insensibility, and Prime Minister Jan Fischer has pointed out that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened with his resignation, the amendments would have been adopted, the situation would have been different.
According to the Czech television, Janota signed up to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He indicated that he considered his further stay in the office.
That is why he is disappointed in the budget negotiations.
As far as fishermen are concerned about the further fight against the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominees of Social Democracy (CSSD) who had made the changes in the budget have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-creating laws, such as those relating to sickness and pensions or to the service laws.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not err
This is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries, people are in a position of representative, who confess to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fisher decides to abandon the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that he relies on the left-hand majority that is currently in Parliament".
Then it is unlikely that he will be able to count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is what is going to be, then I will deal with it, the Minister for Defence, appointed by the citizens' Democrats, Martin Bartak, told the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to the Brussels European Council this afternoon.
The ODS withdrew at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in Parliament if the Prime Minister expressly asked the citizens' Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear to be children, we are not small children, so he responded to the question whether the ODS was not repressed in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the chairman of Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice that my voice would be missing.
As soon as I refused the mandate, I knew that in the coming months, in particular, it would be positive for the Bolsheviks of Parliament and for the destruction of everything, Topolanek itself.
After the new CD's (Czech Railway) timetable, less trains will drive at about the same price.
On 13 December, the Czech railway terminates or restricts some less heavily loaded high-speed and local trains, while other connections are reinforced.
The total volume of traffic is reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new roadmap compared to today.
Most fares including basic and customer fares are not changed.
For example, several connections to the capital will be provided to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, which will use the train of the type Pendolino for this route.
The train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less speed trains are also driven on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the Hradec Kralove district (King's Grace), a total of eight percent, but Prague and the surrounding area can be happy about an increase.
Two night trains are also lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and a few days a week the operation of some fast trains is reduced on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route.
The biggest changes are the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, and the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem need to move.
This is the 15th route of the pre-shipment system Esco, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Main Station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Summerk/Jesennik will run for two hours.
With the Pendolino, the passengers can no longer drive to Bratislava since December 13.
This year's account for regional railways: increase by 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total, they receive the railway to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss in the next year of four billion crowns, just as this year. Local trains provide the districts, in total, they will pay eight billion crowns in the next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year the regional trains are worth 200 million Czech crowns.
For local trains and high-speed trains, the railway has again concluded a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railway praises the system, which is why it may not have caught the price increase in the vast majority of the driving licences.
There is only one day's online CD Net and cheap eLiska internet tickets.
For travellers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the stake, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 kroner.
More than 50 people are being identified by the Philippines militia who have been released.
Today, militants kidnapped 75 persons in the south of the Philippines, including some primary and their teachers.
This was indicated by the AFP agency, which initially informed only about 65 kidnappers.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
There was a kidnapping in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 milliants reportedly used hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to issue the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the militants are part of the Neovolksarmée (NPA), this is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence they demanded from the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the stand was suspended because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November, which was associated with the election to the Government, there were 30 journalists.
Suspected of participating in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippines province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
But on Tuesday, they resumed the peace negotiations with the Philippine government.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film, Clint Eastwoods, comes to the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeatable", which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous apartheid fighter has been won by Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself several years ago.
Matt Damon received the role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar.
With the film's film launch, reactions from critics as well as the public are also heard.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolilaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, then in 1993 together with the Klerk Nobel Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes into the cinemas at a time where preparations for the World Cup are culminating in South Africa, but at the same time the media are threatening the world's public with disturbing news about the growing racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are first and foremost positive, despite numerous reservations about the occupation of the major roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared well for it.
I met Nelson Mandela personally several times so that, as you say, I could receive his energy, he opened the interview after the film's premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a story of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
On the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book of British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́ In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united portraits the South African human rights prosecutor within his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman has been trying to bring together groups of people from two races and from one year to the next, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is also taking part in his role in the South African National Rugby of the World Cup field, which was won by South Africa.
For the entry of the race in the dress, which applies almost as holy action in South Africa, Mandela raised large ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white public and thus gained recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may accomplish the task of bringing people back together as a single people, led by Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, it will only show itself.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as in recent interviews for LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for more than 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchboard at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the speaker of the district firearm Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units are involved in the fire.
Originally, the firearm wanted to burn the transformers, but later it changed its view, and now the fire with a mixture of water foam and special solvents is removed.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer's short-term.
No one was injured, the Havaria was in danger, according to the company spokesman, Pavla Mandatova, not the safety operation of the management system.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million kroner, and the damage will only be reported after the fire.
The destroyed transformer according to Mandatova must be replaced by a new one.
For more than 10 years, there has been nothing similar with the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted by the fire of the Trafostation, according to the spokesperson of CEZ for North Bohemian, Sona Holingerova, and the functionality of households, authorities and companies was not affected.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as a sole operator of the management system, electricity lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, refurbished and develops 39 switch systems with 67 transformers, which transmits the electrical energy into distribution system and wire lines with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura raises a fine for insulting three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises a fine for insulting three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the South Sea District, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice District and the head of the Olomouc District, Martin Tessarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute interview in the radio newspaper.
The complaint is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some areas.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the rosins, in which we have only subverted the offer to the extent that it was agreed with them.
They claimed that we were more expensive than the Czech Railway because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway that were completed last week.
There's nothing left for us to resist.
Because of this insult by the Student Agency, Jancura told the radio newspaper.
At the same time, he argued that he had evidence from all areas that they had taken their steps in line with European law.
That is why we are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hasek holds the prosecution for the further continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as a free advertising for his society as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call for further leaders.
I assume that even in this matter it will be clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments in the area of regional rail traffic, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million kroner in advertising, which would point to the harmful step of the district.
He told the radio newspaper that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after New Year's Eve.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jancura after the districts agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech railway and did not write out tenders for the order in an amount of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the train traffic in the areas, Jancura said he was already a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn't give up that we could lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who his name is, I don't say his name, Jancura told the Radio Journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcals free of charge and free of charge
Immunisation against pneumococcals changes the habit from January.
It should be the first for families to be free and free.
But now votes have been announced that the mandatory impression would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against Pneumococcals will culminate.
The Institute of Medicinal Products is already setting the maximum prices of vaccines that are required to pay the health insurance.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccine
Free vaccines for August children
From January children can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcals born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of vaccine.
Anyone who has already begun vaccination in the last year or earlier must pay for further reintroduction.
The first dose must be given between the third and fifth months of the child’s life.
Already last year, a quarter of families had their children immunized against pneumococcals.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
In total, experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine doses spends between 300,000 and 450,000 kroner per year.
However, they save treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all surface vaccines of children.
The mandatory injection was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcals cause measles, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections cause us to die after testing in hospitals every year up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
Outside of the Czech Republic, the mandatory immunisation of children against pneumococcals was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the immunisation be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccine could be a future obligation.
From January this will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
For example, the chief of the National Association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned the need for a better impression.
Its association has been working long-term for the Pneumococcal Imposition.
The experts at the international conference at which our association was involved were not very satisfied that we had voluntary vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have managed to do so at least.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky started.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against Pneumococcals.
At this point we do not consider it at all, said his speaker Vlastil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claimed.
The president of the specialized society of practical children's doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, says that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of relapses "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine was launched as voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to allow their infants to immunise pneumococcals from next year.
Vaccination against Pneumococcals is also crucial in that it is paid as the first area vaccination of the disease insurance and not by the state.
The insurance should spend money on prevention to save them for further treatment, Cabrnochova says.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
However, care is involved with the practical child doctors involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and then obtained by doctors on the same route as other vaccines issued by the State.
However, some Members feared that the insurance could "make money out of sickness insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance to pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practitioners will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
That won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist's son participates in "Museum Diebstahl"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested for inviting 90 paintings into his vehicle with trailers.
It means that Frank Frazetta Junior and another man would have used a backpack to get into the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his presentation of shapes such as Conan the Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the news agency Associated Press, the artist stopped at the time of the event in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police statement, Frasetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum with all the means to bring all the paintings into storage".
The Agency said that Frank Frazetta Senior is fighting to have given some permission.
Labour defends state and tax increases
The Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure cuts announced in the preliminary report against criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have had an opportunity to "stretch" to show that he meant it seriously with the reduction of the deficit by pushing out the decisions until after the election.
The Treasurer also runs under the pretext that he targeted low and medium-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5-percent increase in social security and a 1-percent cut-off limit in public wage decisions for 2011.
Social insurance benefits
On the other hand, the trade unions have protested that low-gloss receivers are being punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of emerging "problems".
The increase in social security - at about 3 billion UK pounds per year - has made the private economy more difficult, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year will affect about 10 million workers.
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PREVENTION REPORT
Increase in social security by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75 %
New 50 % tax on banker bonus
1 per cent increase in corporate tax for small enterprises
Tax clauses for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government income by 2,5 %
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by £90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be poorer by £190, while a person with £10,000 will be richer by £110 per year.
The ministers said that their target of deficit reduction by 2013 meant "hard decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would fall to 5% of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argues that the scissors of tax increases and expenditure cuts would be "a drop on the hot rock" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit reduction and this is also absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth – affecting the level of debt and the rate of deficit – have been questioned after the Treasury has been forced to revise earlier figures.
In his opinion, the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - much more than the fall of 3.5% predicted in April - while the debt would be higher by £3 billion than previously proposed.
"Exposed opportunity"
The conservatives who wanted to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn Labour's "debt crisis", said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan of how they will repay this and press "cynic" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"They didn't say anything about what they're going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do this, and they let them pass."
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be kept away from future cuts, unlike the conservative proposals, which see deficit recovery faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money earned by tax increases and spending stops is used to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "based on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of announcements - such as the above-mentioned inflation adjustment in some invalidity rates next April - would expose the Chancellor to the draft vote, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour continues to provide extra aid when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although the ministers have not reported details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only come in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Research said that the numbers of the treasury would mean strong cuts in many areas, perhaps in the future also in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only eases the pain later," said his leader Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant at the Deloitte company.
"This was just the high preliminary state report. The markets recognize that."
FBI investigates "the arrests of U.S. citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens due to the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandschab province, and reported the US message to the BBC in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was being investigated whether the same men were reported missing last month in the United States of Virginia.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are to be Pakistani descent, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course we are very interested in the prosecutions that are being brought against them and under what circumstances they are detained," said the speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said that the Authority was informed about the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identity and purpose of their stay, if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that it was Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton who refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US must " work with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by their families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "abuse" in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran is still as bad as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report details "disuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedshad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the largest street protests since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Dozens of prisoners and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC-Teheran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, some of the allegations of abuse were acknowledged and the Kahrizak police station was closed.
But since then, there has been no tolerance from the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of the 26-year-old IT student Ibrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of protesting the election results.
"They often punched me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a wrong confession and became, still bleeding and half unconscious, letting off on the street, Amnesty shared with him.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and others raped.
The Iranian authorities lied about the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a container in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the concerns about the election and the government's reaction to it, but thus Amnesty, the mandate and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees were not published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was installed in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a mark in Bristol into a racetrack.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100 meters long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the summit of the Hangs, but it was also quite scary.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine below.
He added, "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prices were awarded for the best art pieces or tricks performed on the hang.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
She's still hers and we're still hers.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters voted for a ban on mining and the concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most secularised societies in Europe.
Some readers will read this new book with admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love hats" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argumentative study of a question that the country shared and occupied over half a decade and its effects are still to be seen today.
In addition, the latest book offers a more comprehensive and cooler spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants not only to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the area.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutions, which now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic Free Spaces".
He is a good listener, he gives back debates between teachers and students on the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a sin-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these apparently profane matters, he claims that those who make up the daily life are quite different from the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned the Bowen are mostly unconcerned with their Salafi opponents – the prosecutors of the Purist Sunni Islam, which is in contact with Saudi Arabia – today show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a donation and take on both sides.
He infrequents how much French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite who are so passionate about the separation of the Church and the state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He points out that Muslims may experience a harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
Rather, he recognizes a "enhanced value screws" as a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book you tend to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Most Reliable View of the World
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that marks it melts with alarming speed and takes life with it, which can survive nowhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have emerged into the newly opened water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, describes a natural history of the northern iceberg icon.
Moved in the complicated history and politics of the whale, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves at the hunt on the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old fan of the lake, who fought only with the rifle of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were captured when they swam behind the bodies of their recently murdered mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century showed 75 ice bears in a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically own a million sets of the living area of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the ice bear in Singapore was completely green by the algae growing in the tall hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the siege continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motorcycle-driving inuit use powerful storm weapons to bring their bags to the road.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations will remain the longest ice.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a puzzling insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither Atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the rate of change.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanation.
The pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries for the first time left the confusion of the package.
In the Cold War, submarines measure the rate of movement in the underworld.
A useful supplement is satellite measurements and the large-scale expansion of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people who camp outside the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the influx system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater salts that are compressed when freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic small wonders in the ice, all are threatened when the summer journey is over, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... we could be"
Marine infantryists were among the 6,000 who landed in the Arlington border
The De'Angello Robinson, who had been on the bus for seven hours, traveled to put a single cross on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marine infantrymen who took the trip of Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the national cemetery in Arlington to decorate tombs, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose steps they entered.
In a few months, wherever we are brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to place border on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Friedhoff.
Morril Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morris and his wife Karen, who undertake this journey every year, continue in different cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year volunteers spent more than 16,000 crossings on the graves at the Arlington Friedhof, in areas at the Pentagon, at the graves of the National Friedhof Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the Memorial of the United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation spent more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the border.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she had taken the journey to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although your husband is not married in Arlington, Hunt said, this is his way of giving back something that the victims brought back.
She said that this is a small contribution we can make to support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family cemetery.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked across the extended lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World Wars and Vietnam Wars as a goal, since they are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was happy, children played, and couples held their hands while carrying the fresh jawbones to the greyy tombstones.
Each round edge was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is near and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost silent.
The United Service Organizations spent 1,000 dollars to decorate this section, but the darker mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends stuck together in the icy air.
Some read according to the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white spots, which were stuck in the moist mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
It is 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Infraternity Officer David Shane Spicer who fell into battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free, my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been there for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Commander of the U.S. Government arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor from the U.S. government, who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. with a seat in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers such as USAID, the US Office for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the US interest in Havana try to gain access to the prison, which was arrested on 5 December.
The special indictments have not yet been published, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban national or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the "dangerous" charge.
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical writings, are at risk of imprisonment.
Government-friendly graffiti and statements are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tension between the communist government of the Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The arrest message was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasises that the United States will be given a victory when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they will be used to send text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a day's wage.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government sites, such as universities.
Cubans who want to sign in often have to register their names.
Too many websites have limited access.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in Cuba are in prison for crimes such as drug smuggling behind bars, Gloria Berbena said, the U.S. press spokesman in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and the arrest are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the issue of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba with the title "New Castro, the same Cuba", a reflection on the establishment of Raul Castro as the country's leader, who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused would be arrested, convicted and arrested very often within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States at the moment when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered a allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said they hoped that this case could help to detect an extensive network of terrorists who would search the Internet for radicalized young men.
Researchers said that they had been looking for an unbiased rebel, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had discovered it because he had made comments about terrorist attacks on Internet video YouTube.
Saifullah was born after her arrival in Pakistan by the leaders of these men and tried to help them reach the remote territory of Pakistan's family belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's Secret Service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince Al-Qaida leaders that men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to submigrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the unwarranted mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were seen as part of a hidden operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged and continued to try to receive the right recommendations to gain access to the al-Qaida warehouses when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of the applicants in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. intelligence service has made it a matter of the highest urgency to subvert human assets within Al Kaida.
The applicants of the organization act as pfortners who do not allow those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and who might be spies.
American recruiters are being subjected to a special test by A Kaida, analysts said.
Due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also seen as an intrusive attraction for the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the top analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have become much more cautious in recent years as to whom they allow access, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to include someone in these groups, what better way could you go than following the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling for climate action in Copenhagen
Ten thousand demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded more cooler climate protection action from dealers at the Bella Congress Centre in the city.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more than 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists burned small explosives near some government buildings in the city.
On one day, when the UN-supported climate negotiations had little to do with thousands of activists with transparency across the city, on which there was "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travels to Peru, the country of birth of her mother, make her aware of what heartbreaking problems the country has to deal with because of the already tangible effects of climate change.
This is part of the reason why I have decided to take part in the great demonstration - to further the word and appeal to the world leader to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the fact that they were either masked or carrying bags.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to an observer who did not want to be mentioned, since he is involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing burned several explosives near the Copenhagen Main Channel, near which are several ministries.
They threw them near the building, he said and added that they began as lighttracks, but then they were followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered at television screens to monitor the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the main official's consciousness, such as Su Wei, China's chief climate dealer.
When asked whether he thought that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international discussions, he referred to English: "That is something I was not aware of".
Then he went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on out there."
He found that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of others".
Test data show hard-earned race air
The certificates of mathematical performance last week were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the country's schools, the evidence shows that in the past two years the fourth and eighth classes have made faster progress than in the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) is the hard-working gap between African and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average number of white quartz cells from Washington D. C. has risen from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), which rose by only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eight clauses remained essentially the same, with a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white students was not included in the test data as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap between the white and black quarters of 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district was 60 points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that have reached the children of both groups has grown in this period of time, the difference has now declined by 58 points.
Last week some of the district’s education advocates expressed their concern that the results of student Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were promoted to the majority of white students, who are well-functioning children.
This indicates that we have raised the overall assessment by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that enters Washington D.C. for education equality.
I am not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points, said the Democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton Primary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test points is that the city's secondary schools urgently need attention.
Of course you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
What I fear, however, is that we do not spend almost the time and energy that we should spend on our secondary school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
In this fall, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new curriculum, the Wilson-Lese system, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary schools, which did not master the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school course and which are significantly behind their peers.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum that takes the lead from the kindergarten to the sixth class of games and life experience, was brought to Washington by former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think that we must continue to work to bring the best measures to the benefit of students who are below the score level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and continue to provide additional money and resources for the weak schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who investigates urban testing results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could lead to political consequences that are working against this important agenda item.
The weakness is, of course, like in other city school inspectors, that they try to keep the white and black middle.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the city districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the service gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with charter schools.
It is necessary to increase the school year to about 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement last year with his teaching staff over 185 days per year which he saw as "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than for the future
The travel bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stands out and blinks a moment in view of the white columns, the brick facades and the orange green breed.
Graciela's parents have barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was granted in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never put a foot on a college campus.
Her attitude and the other octopuses of the group, the Gettysburg, where teaching costs $38.690 per year, was rather the fearsome visitor than the enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was reported the low-to-student ratio of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th who visited the children on their three-day tour and now they have taken full note of the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born to Spanish immigrants in the United States who do not end high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand there are also hundreds of thousands who receive college education that is necessary to get into the middle level.
In fact, one of the five "second generation" of HispanoAmericans shuts down the college – which is a remarkable performance, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having graduated from high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the labour force of the country.
Those who examine powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for the school and a successful drive to their home.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of confidence in American schools.
But counselling programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to get to college, especially if these efforts continue for a longer time.
If you consider low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then at some point a single measure will not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, who examined hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program that had funded Gracielas College Tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - One step up - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that start when poor middle school students are and continue until they have completed high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of whom more than 60% have attended college.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
In spite of concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to re-establish its damaged infrastructure in two final auctions on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil show that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been plagued by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 promoted fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has drawn the shorts.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields awarded in June.
The thinly seated representatives of the American oil multis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies, Asian and Europeans set out the way, said Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will long be no further offers in Iraq.
Security concerns, which were still highlighted by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability by the withdrawal of the U.S. military, have probably stopped American oil companies from doing so, analysts said to engage more strongly in Iraq, which has the third largest proven oil reserves in the world.
In some cases, US firms were disadvantaged because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, had significantly lower wage costs and were more at risk because they did not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon mobile and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been following technical advice in recent years, have failed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The Chinese State Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the world's largest economies and a technological power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can meet its partners and fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
For the award fee, selected companies issued orders that were then compared to the fee per barrel oil, which the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In the event of an apparent US missile attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan this week, a top-use planner of Al-Qaida was killed, as reported representatives of the U.S. Counter-Terrorism on Friday.
This would be if it were to be confirmed that the second deadly attack on a highly responsible terrorist organization in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were supposed to have been killed by a number of rockets, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region, who hit their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North-Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless herd belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said a representative of Pakistani civil service from Miran Shah by phone.
The locals suspected of belonging to the militants fled the scene and quickly took over everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism argued that Somalia belonged to the dead.
Somalia was described as the leading military planner of Al-Qaida, which led terrorist groups operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy all over the world, noticed a leading official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the fierce character of the US air attacks on Pakistani soil.
When it is adopted as a given central role, this also included planning attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from Al Kaida's top leaders and turned them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. representative said that Somalia quickly rose in the Al-Qaida hierarchy and maintained the best links to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death had been confirmed, Somalia would have been the second leading Al-Qaida or Taliban leader who had been killed since September as a result of a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has since summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability and at the same time brutally kill suspected informants, the page reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul to retreat
The leading UN envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would withdraw from his office in March, ending a stormy period of office, which was devastated by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
One move took place when Obama's government decided to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed concern that the US military retreat plan, which should start in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilians to help with Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he was not depriving his office, but only one of his family's agreements reached in March 2008 to remain in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to notify the UN.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now forward so that he can have time to make a replacement.
What I said is he'd better start looking for a successor," Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started to look for a replacement, according to UN representatives.
UN representatives say that he has taken into consideration the Swedish-Italian-sponsored Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who led the previous UN peace operations.
One position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and of concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all charges, but he also said that the charges of Galbraith - which was fired - "the mission has undoubtedly caused damage because there was already a great deal of skepticism in relation to international integration in the election".
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief measures of the US-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allow its successor to recruit more staff from the United States and other Western countries contributing to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in their proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the current UN regimes have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules have been designed so that since May, he said, only one person could be set up.
This is a disaster and cannot go on like this.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon be "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he has not participated in talks on his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and played a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good options to choose, he said in response to the question of a soldier about the probability of such a development.
"One of the things that lies in my soul is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which is the unpredictability of the war."
The Obama government is considering a sanctions package aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed to "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected by nuclear weapons", because "your people will suffer unhappily" under the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by White House Speaker Robert Gibbs, the US government joined the European top politicians in warning that Iran must face "believers" consequences if it does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Authority, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology is to be gained only for peaceful purposes.
In the course of discussions in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks on the limitation of its nuclear programme and reject a substantial part of its stockpiled uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has urged this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to make time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community in relation to some of the proposals it had already agreed to in early October has openly said that the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, has brought together in a way that they have never done in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama set the deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those once called 'impressive sanctions' by Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In an opinion given in New York, the Iranian representative of the United Nations condemned what she called "unfounded and unfounded claims" on Thursday by some Security Council members on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they were ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington on the last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the vast Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates forced both sides to lower the potential of conflict to prevent delays in US plans to reduce US troops by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to destroy Kurdish concern about the upcoming troops retreat. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, said: "We will get your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change of course in older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lectures taught them so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, the low birth rate and the older population began suddenly this summer to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "No case".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, Wang said, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of a one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, worn-out individual children, who are lovingly called "small emperors", a population crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate is 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time when this policy came into force.
Division for Population Issues, while the number of population aged 60 and older in 2020 from 16.7 per cent of the population is expected to increase to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is far above the global average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated people, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, leader of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples must get into the creative age of babies to "help reduce the proportion of older people and reduce the labour gap in the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
The country's constitution anchored in 1978, China's one-child policy should probably be the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy must face huge fines -- up to their three-year annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese state representatives have attributed this policy to the fact that the critical claim of the natural resources of the country could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the implementation of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to leave.
In addition, many couples had had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was revealed.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing Institute for Population Research, said that government representatives recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with a single child partner.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city in July, which launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
The posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by directives that describe in detail who is infringing for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent city employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and move information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not exactly encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointment reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the rural areas of Shanghai said that there was a delay in the requests of couples who wanted a second child after the campaign started, the urban areas did not change.
In the municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are still available as an example per month.
Desperate Shanghai officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still lie at about 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Shanghai Family Planning Committee, the municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want any more children.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and this was also legal.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a small health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge one-child policy as a human rights issue, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yeah, we're robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their lazyness.
Wang, the staff leader, said she only wanted a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we do not really want this."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unmistakably.
For parents from middle school with a double career through which the birth rate decreases, he said, it turns out to be successful and must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don't want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, puts enormous demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a life course for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to do this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group plans to reduce emissions
The UN-supported climate conference -- which has so far been marked by wild possies and mutual accusations -- has put again a focus on Friday with the publication of a document, which for the next 40 years will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, with industrial nations having to shoulder the greatest burden in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas management has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiations that will take time, as more than 100 top politicians from around the world will arrive next week in Copenhagen.
The text, which was formulated by a separate UN working group for this purpose, varies over the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that these global warming can be mastered in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large-scale countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature rise would be that of political decision makers.
The process will provide great flexibility, says John Coequyt, the leading representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page long negotiating text to focus on what the UN's leading climate protection representative Yvo de Boer referred to as "the whole".
It shows the basis for a possible agreement whereby industrial nations together would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent at the same time.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given talks on Friday a boost through its assurance to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
The Friday, however, brought the same verbal fireworks that the talks had decided last week.
The US Climate Commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations that require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if not financed by industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is driving a harder line with China than the Bush government's representative not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging countries taking action, so as to ensure that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions can also be confirmed by outsiders.
Star gave his opinion an hour after the statement by Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei, who said that the leading American climate dealer was either lacking in "reason" or that he was "most irresponsible" because he said at the beginning of the week that the United States of China would not help financially to master global warming.
The fact that the future economic march of the great world powers is at stake has led to broken lines between industrial nations as well as between industrial nations and emerging countries.
At the same time, the current struggle concerns the rescue of individual economies, as well as the rescue of the planet, in which China and the United States agree on their respective obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for those who should bear the costs of slowing down the greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have gone beyond this, to act more aggressively in order to bring the countries with a very high greenhouse gas contribution into account for their actions.
This is clearly a game in which a new economic predominance will develop, says Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants said that the talks would lead to a political agreement at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 Member States presented a 24-page draft on early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is leading the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensives of small island states " exert political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency when delegates focused on the fact that most open questions still need to be clarified before the government leaders arrive to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister of Justice, are taking off their aircraft and are streaming through the Bella Centre to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to get rid of claims that will be negotiated next week.
The pure size of the assembly -- 13,000 people go into the conference centre every day and out, guitar-responsive activists hold night shows in which they make fun of the countries that are betraying and selling their opinion, and hand-to-hand designs are forwarded by e-mail instead -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is only growing: almost all important ministers are here now and from Wednesday will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to Oberliga," said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of Global Policy of the Organization of Conservation International.
The weights are coming.
UK first 225 km/h fast train defines Monday feeling new
On Monday morning at 5 p.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce an additional voyage that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed high-speed train in the country will reach ascent from Ashfort, Kent, after London St. Pancras 225 km/h and lay 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will then take Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin-Pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will finally be connected to an international rail network of faster, reliable trains and connects the large areas of the Mediterranean, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become viable cities of pendler, working hours would be radically reduced and the change of aircraft and cars to the train would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the streets.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds required for the construction of a new national rail network could still be the brakes for the British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will submit the report on 30 December, according to the Times.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London with the West Midlands will pass with a five-metre playing space in urban areas and in places where the impacts on the environment are controversial.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, north-east leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would be shared in or near Birmingham and a slope would lead west of the Pennins to Manchester and Scotland and another towards the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said one railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours for 40 minutes.
The first partial route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with today over an hour.
The designs offer the train the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was designed so that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can ride on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This would mean, again, that an end station in London would be needed, on which 20,000 travellers could be made per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station would be developed to undermine the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued in his opinion, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains had to change from high-speed lines to existing railway lines in northern Birmingham, which would continue to last for more than three hours between London and Scotland.
This is a crucial turning point in order to ensure a change from aircraft to train, a guide for the rail revolution.
Tax collectors come for mortgages for 75,000 pounds of a conservative arrangement
Alan Duncan, the leader of the Conservatives' sub-house, has paid thousands of pounds per year to the taxpayer for the costs of an orangery which he has been able to build in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained that underprivileged members had to live "from lean raids", had raised his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build an oak-wood plant at his second house in Rutland.
He allowed the taxpayer to take into account the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
At that time, the sub-house officials approved the applications and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Leg, who carried out a review of the expenses of the sub-house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been "not yet cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest interior members, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (€1.1 million).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a meeting point of the basement, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called "Orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors describe him as a "Glasshouse for Entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited during a recent examination of his previous mortgage agreements by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to take an opinion on the increase in cash collection.
The Committee gave it a discharge last month following an examination of its expenditure from the infringement of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his constituency, which he had purchased a year before his election as a member of Parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan was reimbursed as a mortgage interest of approximately 1,400 pounds per month by March last year.
In April, his claims amounted to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncans RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, which is close to the total increase in funding the raising of 75,000 pounds (EUR 85,000).
The normal phaseless RBS hypothesis fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the sub-house show that Duncan continued to apply to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in May.
Duncan lost his position in September as the opposition leader of the sub-house after filming him undercover when he said after the canal of expenditure that members of Parliament would live "from lesser ratios".
"In essence, it means when you work for the state that you have to live by lesser ratios and how S*****e is treated."
He said: I have expended my money on account of my garden, and raise up for myself from it a small portion according to the measure thereof.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I'm not doing it."
The parliamentary member, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil dealer, was attacked for his expenses for the first time in May, as it became clear that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before he had declared with the Fees Office that this could be considered "as an excessive demand".
An activist, as a protest in Duncan Rasen, dug a hole in the form of a pound sign after it became known that he had requested 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This was both by the Fees Office and then by law to the increase."
He added: "There is no debate about deviations and loopholes or a bending of the rules or similar.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."
Come all your believers to admire Brighton's beach hat advent calendar
Beachhouses in Brighton have found a new content of life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that stimulates spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest cottages every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free sparkling wine and traditional mince pies, filled with dried dishes.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hat decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Howe, is an honorary spiritualist of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and have exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach hat advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and lively place and we try to express it through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Ten thousand people have demonstrated worldwide on Saturday and in Copenhagen to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on combating climate warming, where the police have taken several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, are marched in the cold of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, increasing mobilization in the world for the climate contributes to the fact that these demonstrations show that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, had broken windows with plaster stones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP said.
Anti-unrest policemen have attacked immediately and without regard.
The police have announced that, according to your assessment, between 600 and 700 members of "the Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splitter groups, who have already become famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has severely criticised the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were arrested "without distinction", and stressed that about a hundred of you "were always detained on Saturday evening in the streets", despite the extreme cold with gloves and in situ.
The rather peaceful train went from Parliament towards the Bella Centre, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have stayed about 500 meters away from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the scheduled speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators were driven by buses and trains from large European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with blue raincoats, have made a first tour in Copenhagen in the morning, as you are following the call of the Earth's friends "blue times" for the "climate justice".
Today we go on the streets to demand a refund of ecological debt for the south, Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen, explained.
We can't go on like this and say we have time, Angelique Kidjo meant, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out where you can walk, just as there has never been a case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
European Member José Bové, as the Globalisation Critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate and social justice": "There is no difference today between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific space, where many islands are at particular risk from warming, has given the start shot for the demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people went to the streets, according to the organizers in Australia.
In Manila, there were hundreds of people, mostly students who were marched into Red and had met Bandanas, in which you have glorified the sun energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, some hundreds of demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva some people gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia has chosen its president, Georgia announces that it is a "string" here.
Abkhazia has elected its president on Saturday, which took place a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as its own, Tbilisi denounced the "string".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 to control the South-Ossetian region, another Georgian sessionist area, which was recognised by Russia.
The polls closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The electoral participation was about 58% a few hours before the poll was closed, according to the Abkhaz electoral commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Sunday night.
The five candidates, including former President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of a reunification with Georgia that condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, said that Abkhazia is now under total Russian rule, his press spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world sees it as part of Georgia, which is legally occupied by Russia.
After dissociating himself from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to a polling station in a school in the capital of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
There are large paintings on which you can see by the Russian President and the Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, everywhere in this small area, that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief Beslan Archba has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhazia people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration to acknowledge Abkhazia's independence as an act of support for Moscow, in particular with regard to the decision.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, responded and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticised the agreements that were reached with Moscow in the previous year, as those in Abkhazia Russia had left the railway control for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this limit, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Ten thousand people have demonstrated everywhere in the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding contract from the Copenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any given time, have arrested some 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
According to the police, one hundred thousand people have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which until 18 December receives delegates from 193 countries seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament marched the peaceful train towards the Bella Centre, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have stayed about 500 meters from the center and have not tried to invade.
A stage was built to welcome the scheduled speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train was over, a group of demonstrators who were completely dressed in black and were armed with backstones and with hammers began to insert discs, a journalist of the AFP said.
Anti-unrest policemen you have just hacked into and attacked without consideration by throwing some of you on the floor.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people have been arrested and made it clear that they are mainly members of "the Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splitter groups, who have already become famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
On the other hand, in the meantime, a police officer, according to the police, who was arrested about 20 persons, was injured in the child by a plaster stone. Four vehicles were burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in the grip," said police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces are circling in the air.
Most demonstrators who traveled by train or by their own vehicle from German capitals, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the blue raincoat, formed themselves in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "Blue Sea" for "climate justice".
"Today we are going on the road to demand that ecological debts be repaid to the people of the south," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition from the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say no more : we still have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that conquer, there are watercourses through which one can walk, which was never the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, has brought the movement of the anti-globalisation opponents closer to environmental organisations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and Globalisation Critic José Bové said against the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference today between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several individuals, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are turning to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific space, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given rise to protests.
In Australia, about 50,000 people went to the street, according to the organizers.
In Manila, a number of hundreds of people, in most of the students, dressed in red with Bandanas, before the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in action against climate change.
During the demonstrations organized by the '350 network' in France, several hundred people joined together, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
The fields of geography and history go forward, according to Chatel, strengthened from the school reform of the Lycaeans.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", that the fields of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the lycées, even though they are not compulsoryly taught in the terminal (12th year of school).
"The students of the Premiere (11st school year) now have all four hours of the week and the same program," says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this sanity must be overcome," because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in general a concentration "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientist," he continued. He stressed: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who had been impressed by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanité found that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticise the state project of deleting compulsory teaching in history and geography in Terminal S (12th year of school with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals are also lacking this project, as well as the links and some representatives of rights.
On the other hand, the Minister replied that there was no question about a restriction on the philosophy of the terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest on Tuesday against the project, which they felt would be the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister explained that they were in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year of a professional fitness examination and at the end of the year of an authorisation examination, in which their teaching skills are tested.
They also conduct practice during the year in the M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in the practice.
He continued: "If you add all the practices offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "something that does not exist in public education."
He confirmed once again that he wanted to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Superiore"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use at the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", had to deal with at the Ecole Normale Superiore in Rue d'Ulm in Paris on Saturday.
As a journalist of the AFP observed, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first "Ernest" conferences, at which experts turned to the public for 15 minutes with filmed contributions.
You want to do something to reach people and make them feel better about learning more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the names given by the students to the fish in the school pool.
"Besides the experts, the twenty participants were selected, even after their charisma," he said.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours. But the core objectives can be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke only freely with the help of foils.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the audiences would appreciate that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online on the school side from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Payment delay : angry prison guards, planned actions
The unions of law enforcement officials called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the premiums and overtimes for which payment was suspended for budgetary reasons until January will be transferred before Christmas.
The 2nd union of law enforcement officials ("FO-Penitentiaire"), urged the employees who do not have any service to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday before the law enforcement agency, to pay attention to the "steel of what belongs to them".
The third union of criminal law enforcement officers ("CGT Penitentiaire") called for "to unite itself to a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the overtime, nighttime allowances and the Sunday and holiday allowances in December is marked as "disgusting and unacceptable".
The first union of law enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the Penal Service and the Ministry of Justice declared that the surpluses had risen significantly in 2009 and not all were provided for in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the law enforcement agencies guaranteeing payment in the coming month.
"I know very well about the efforts of staff to keep and modernise our criminal justice system functioning," the Minister of Justice says in this letter.
"I have directed the management of the criminal prosecution centre to take immediate action to ensure that a situation created by the lack of assessment of the overtimes is not repeated in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December pay is therefore lower, except for management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budgetary burdens" have to be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional FO trade union in Marseille feels and announces that "all collections and calls" to boycott new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and holidays when the hours from October are still not paid in December. This is also true of their overtime," also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-auvergne.
"In a time when we are increasingly tasked without more staff being assigned, the attempt to enrich ourselves with the staff's money is more than inappropriate," says the CGT Society of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
However, in any case it is wrong, the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget, states.
Obama is the view that he spends Christmas always better gifts than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, will spend the first time with his family in the White House for the first time on Christmas, has announced to the TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is always giving better gifts than he is getting himself.
At a special broadcast broadcast on Sunday evening over channel ABC, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holiday in their new illustrative home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog also receives a gift.
Michelle Obama turned down her husband's claims about the quality of gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she denies the president.
"So please," he scolded and pointed out to the first lady's pearl chain: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour reflection in an uncompromising atmosphere with the famous television moderator Barack Obama had so much support during his election, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-speed bicycle and also a basketball that his father had brought him, which he saw very rarely, to Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father once visited us for Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"Just a lot later in my life I realized that I had this ball from him."
The first lady remembered her doll house.
"I didn't even know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperates, RTL confirms that he was transferred to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles due to significant "damaging" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was moved into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors had identified "damaging the damage caused by the operation of a tape disc incident", which he had suffered in Paris on November 26th, adding his production company in Paris, adding that these damage had required a new operation.
However, the singer’s production company wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and said that a new medical opinion would be available within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, however, Johnny Hallyday was moved into an artificial coma to avoid "pains and complications".
Only after 48 hours, however, you had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes, added RTL.
At the request of the AFP there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "comes from certain sources", that after his first operation in Paris, "no kind of drainage" was placed.
The rocker was operated at Parc Monceau's international clinic due to a tape record incident.
The surgery planned for several days was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments against RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's operation, the singer was delivered on Monday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles due to a follow-up infection after the attack.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was against RTL on Thursday, thinking that his friend was just going through a "deep valley" but he assured you that you need "no worries" to make the rock musician, since he was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles. I told him it would be wise to put himself in a plane for 12 hours after such an operation, which doesn't work," Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "responsive to antibiotics" and that "the infection is infested".
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken with Laettia, the singer's wife, and he did not feel particularly upset.
However, the care for the singer’s health has been growing since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he was hit by his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, the speech that Johnny Hallyday had had a "small bowel cancer-OP", which led to a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a separate tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented out. Fans and journalists have not been removed that the singer has been trying to move on stage.
By mid-November, the people surrounding him had to disembark a return to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Busquet over its favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medal winner at the Swedish World Championships in 2009, won an international title on Thursday about its favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethanes were allowed, there were only three world records, while a true record flow was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Surprised over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m.
Damage for busquet, which wanted to catch after the world record at the 50th freestil, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
At one of the two king's distances in swimming, 50m-freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatians Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe more and more and more, and in this case I have said, if the world record is in my reach, I will try it."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in Polyurethane trailers that are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epics in Istanbul, which started in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not been paid this time for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record, at the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestil (3:32.77), yet he has pursued himself with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danes Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I haven't given everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
USA : Countdown at Zola at 1.5 million US dollars estimated
A Roman record that was calculated by French writer Emile Zola was estimated at 1.5 million dollars on Thursday, according to the artist Sotheby's.
This record is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the third century after Christ and has always been valued with $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of dionysos are represented in a sophisticated architecture decor, surrounded by satires and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," explained Florent Heintz, Vice President for the Promotion of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby's, on Tuesday against the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still going on, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered most of the time," says Sotheby's spokesperson, Dan Abnerthy, against the AFP.
The discovery of this purchase of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The album was almost 300 years old in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family home, and then it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her Paris hotel bathroom and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshall Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "Erbe of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelayas exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been eliminated
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soils as no longer acceptable, after this leadership had refused by the Putsch government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, everything seems to indicate that one disagrees with the possibilities for carrying out this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the Immigration Authority, the plane set up by the Mexican Government was returned to its original location on Wednesday in Salvador for the purpose of the transfer of Mr. Zelayas.
The Putsch government wanted Mr. Zelaya to "think" and ask him abroad for political asylum under his guidance.
However, the President-in-Office refused this because he wanted to return to Mexico as the welcoming head of state.
The Putsch regime "has experienced a renewed failure by wanting to give up on my costs (...), they wanted me to say thank you," said Mr. Zelaya on Thursday to Radio Globo, where he has been often reported to the floor since the beginning of the political crisis in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and like ten years, here I have my guitar, added the defeated President who had fled two and a half months ago to the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa, under attacks of some agreement.
The Mexican message has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, since it does not contain a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Putsch Government, told the Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I'm not asking for asylum at all, but Manuel Zelaya had responded in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, as he had stressed, would only take place as President of the Hondurasn people.
On Wednesday, the announcements about an exit from M. Zelayas had mobilized the supporters of the president who had risen to the Brazilian message and gathered around it, and the military there had strengthened its use.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the Putsch government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez, was shocked on 28 June, on the day of the poll organized by him to prepare for his re-election, against the Council of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he was surprised to return on September 21, and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he abandons this, he will be arrested for treason, for which he is accused by justice, according to the Putsch government.
The Putsch President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to free Mr Zelaya.
In the course of the contested election, Porfirio Lobo was recognised by the United States and was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later the Congress had voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street, the U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
On Thursday, the New York Stock Exchange concluded with a high level, the figures of the US trade balance show that the United States shares and their partners have been reduced by 0.67%, the Nasdaq has added 0.33%.
According to the figures for stock exchanges, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10,405,83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190,06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index was described by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from different economic sectors, determined by Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premier that the market focuses only on "half-glasses", as they measured.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are particularly focused on the figures of the US trade balance, which "is an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
In October, the United States' trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion compared to September.
In contrast, the analysts had calculated an increase in deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The major innovation is the increase in the overall volume of trade, particularly in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the US’ main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell from Company Research Economy.com.
In contrast, unemployment reports in the United States have increased in the last week against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 applications.
However, during the last four weeks, the average value of new job seekers has been "falling at the bottom of the year", said Scott Marcouliler of Wells Fargo Advisor.
The bond market is down.
The profitability of State loans at 10 years has risen to 3,482 % compared to 3,432 % of the service night, the profitability of the loans at 30 years at 4,492 % compared to 4,408 % of the evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans standing in power peeping "woman in Weiss"
On Thursday, some hundreds of Cuban-led partisans have taken advantage of the marriages of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Day of Human Rights and have also banned another announcement, which has temporarily detained a good dozen dissidents.
In order to get the forty women in Weiss, married women or close political prisoners, on the open street of partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were at the foot march in the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist at the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankees!, "Soldner!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "It lives Fidel and Raul!" the powerful partisans with raised Faust opposed the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilians who appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "women in Weiss" had taken place in Havana in the evening, in which neither injured nor arrested.
On the other hand, in the port district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents, who also staged the demonstration on Thursday in view of the International Day of Human Rights, were temporarily arrested by civil policemen, confirmed by an AFP reporter.
According to this journalist, policemen forced dissidents from the government's partisans to enter civilian vehicles using violence.
The temporary arrest of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As rapporteurs at the 2005 Sakharov Prizes given by the European Parliament, the "Women in Weiss" organized an unauthorized march for the "Pray for the Liberation of All Political Prisoners", whose number is estimated to be around 200 dissidents, Laura Pollan, one of the leading women whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003 from which 53 sit behind bars.
The Cuban authorities feel the regime's opponents as "soldner" or "agents" in the service of the declared enemy, the United States.
A rarity is that Cuban television provided a report on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and counter-revolutionarys.
Cuba, led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of restricting rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of opinion.
Crazy kills eight-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
On Friday afternoon at noon at the main business time in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) an eight-year-old was killed and five others were injured.
According to the first figures of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eight-year-olds from an unexplained cause in or before a pharmacy at the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police records, was under the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is reported to have suffered the consequences of his injuries in the hospital, according to a police syndicate Alliance.
In or before the same apothecary, he had engaged a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the triangles, was attacked and injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured in the hospital where the 18-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life, since according to police sources, apparently vital organs have been affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and is supposed to have been hospitalized in the "shock state" according to a police unit.
The armed man who appears to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs according to police reports should be immediately on the road, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passengers, apparently by accident: one three-and-a-four-year-old, the last of the two difficult.
The scenario stayed in the dark at night.
He had been armed with two butchers who had crossed behind his back, on site, Arnaud Pressé, a head of the union alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passengers, including young people, should have tried to bind the insane, according to the witness reports of the AFP.
I saw a guy in the tricycles with a green west.
Three young people tried to break in.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, said Alberto, a basement of a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, among them a policeman who broke his wrist.
Still at the Boulevard Jean-Jares, at the height of house number 61, two city policemen, including their chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knives, such police data.
The event took place in one of the main battles of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of shops.
Passants have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old lying on the floor, I brought them into the first aid position and noticed a striking wound in the stomach, said Frédéric Allion, a 35-year-old apothecary, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about three-year-old, was injured by cutting wounds.
Finally, the police force arrested the man who did not carry any evidence.
Nanterre's State Prosecutor has commissioned the district police department's Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to report on the case.
The madman has been hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been given legal notice.
A police unit does not assume that it will be delivered to a nervous system.
According to another police source, there were six police officers who wanted to hang him at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken away.
He was "in a state of overwhelming" as "all spiritual confused by this kind, in which the forces were released during the tathering".
USA: Polanski's lawyer is calling again for prosecution.
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called on Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to allow the prosecution of his clients, who is currently in his place of residence in Switzerland due to a seat arrest more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", has made serious procedural errors in the second district of California before three judges of the Court of Appeal in 1977.
I'm calling for a sentence, Mr. Hummel said before he added that the behavior of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was responsible for the case at the time of the trial, "was allowed to run a cold down the back".
According to him, the - now dead - judge Rittenband, before he fell into trial, discussed with a state attorney who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski had earned a home -- which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion was published in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and wanted), particularly by the instigated state attorney David Wells.
Finally, at the end of September, Mr. Wells stated that the authors of the documentary film were "blessed".
If the Court of Justice refuses to put an end to the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel asks for the conduct of a process that would enable him to provide evidence for his arguments.
The prosecution has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the removal of the accused's assets cannot be seriously taken into account until Roman Polanski appears before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, even before the publication of the fine for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
Since then, he has not traveled to the United States.
The Deputy Attorney General of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to attend the negotiations".
Would you like to spread the message in this matter and not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, who is a possibility of escape?, Mrs. Asayma asks.
According to her opinion, the filmmaker "asks the court for a case and thus disregards its authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to make their decision known – even pointed out that "there are other options to escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the imposition of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Also, the lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, demanded the abolition of the criminal procedure.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear it to be disturbed by any resurgence of the Polanski affair and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Twenty-two years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September at the launch of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of any surrender.
Wall Street is blocked by the rise of the dollar and closed without a course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a course in a market that was better than expected in the United States and saw an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, and Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq 0.55 points to 2,190,31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has risen by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Truly, the market is quite quiet," said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains strictly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, "which have contributed to improving the market view of the stability of economic recovery", analysts from Charles Schwab said.
In the United States, sales in retail trade increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months apart and far more than expected.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers has improved significantly in December, at 73.4 compared with 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan's Index Preview.
However, the indices have been blocked by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has been the highest in the euro for two months, thus 'pressing down the sectors that are vulnerable to the economic situation', said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something on the ground.
The bond market has gone back.
On Wednesday evening, the yield of the 10-year-old treasure loan rose by 3,540 % compared to 3,482 % and the loan increased from 30 years to 4,497 % compared to 4,492 % of the day.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's tour through South Africa, 112 candidates under the title of Miss World on Saturday will go beyond the last curtain to realize their dream: to be chosen for the most beautiful woman in the world and watch this in front of a billion television viewers.
While this great fair of beauty, which will be held for the second time in the vicinity of Johannesburg, has already completed five of its tickets to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were cut off during their African stay to Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model.
This was a real struggle of pleasure.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Kap Hoorn, were simply exceptional.
I've seen a lot of things and made every amount of experience!," said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be delivered live on Saturday, from 17 a.m. (15 p.m.) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, Ms. World Ksenia Sukhinova stressed in the heat of South African summer.
For the young Russians, their second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "attractive landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, encounters with the press and Safari, the miss now concentrates on the competition.
The Inderin Poja Chopra hopes to enter the steps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as Ashwarya Rai, who was elected 1994 and were both Bollywoodstars.
Of course, it is every woman's dream to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about looking.
We are messengers of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the event, this 59th edition will be highlighted with music and dance.
The candidates are defiling in traditional ways and not forgetting, in the bathroom.
The presentation is presented by a TV moderator, the Chinese Angela Chow, by the former beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and by a director of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is wise to receive the world with a little excess heart and pride, Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates have, like last year, made a safari, visiting the famous Township in Soweto, but this time it cost with the bike and the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand, was quite exceptional.
Not usually for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, remains undoubtedly the release in Cape Town (Southwest) of the June 2010 football World Championship, a kind of country to recruit for this event something more.
I'm wrong with people I could probably never get closer to.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Cup, promised by Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is according to his son David "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", his son David assured on Friday at his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday explained the press when he got off the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. MEZ) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would "fastest" go to Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a tape record event on November 26.
The singer was put in an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and to perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma in which he was delivered on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection after a tape drive operation on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to undergo another operation at night from Wednesday to Thursday, due to the illness caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laettia took part in a school tomorrow in the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade attends school, a photographer of the AFP.
The head of the department for orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salpétrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has heavily charged neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer at the Clinique international du park Monceau in Paris on November 26.
They told us he set up the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely upset, Mr. Camus said.
I heard that a trial might be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "is too fast and this is traveled with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I called this doctor personally, who assured me that he saw this trip as completely unproblem, which surprised me very much, since I had already two tape drives operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he became known to RTL that the singer would have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without anything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist's environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma after brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation who has been convicted on several occasions because of failed operations and not to be forgotten because of tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Chamber of Doctors, referred to him as "a man without scruples" who has to "regularly" before the Board of Directors and is "all other than recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This explained that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would be "normal".
The operation "does not call for bleeding and therefore does not require drainage", he added.
At any rate, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been running since late summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear from the hand that it is too little for a continuation of the tour on January 8th (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) Party Alliance will be energetic and calls on the New Centre Party not to use its seal anymore.
The Party Alliance, which is being monitored by François Bayrou's MoThe Party, reacted strongly on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, the party founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the side of the president of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and urged him to use this seal no longer in any document under threat of legal persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, since he felt that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had reached the left hand.
The defence minister, whose partner is the UMP, also wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In response to his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who claimed the ownership of the UDF brand, as he applied for the "Institut national de la prépété industriale" as the first such brand in 2004.
However, the business number of the UDF's friends monitored by François Bayrous's friends broke the silence and made it clear that they did not fit and put the Minister and the honourable Member under threat of legal persecution a time limit for the use of this seal and the transfer of the rights of the brand.
In the last few days, you have made numerous statements that you would propose your political movement to take over the UDF seal+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You probably also believed that you had the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the slogan + of today's UDF+, on their political material and on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this seal, the company of the UDF explained and asked the Party NC to "remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (your) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was asked "to transfer the property rights of the brand to its legal rights".
If you refuse this, we will raise complaints against you in order to comply with the law and in order to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter they stress that "UDF "has been a complete political movement since 1978 and remembers that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave this 2007 in order to establish a competitive movement as it had already done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
The Nouveau Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française) according to the signatory.
They continue to recall that the last UDF 2007 Congress adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a business agency to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the company continues, "as he has been applying for the brand name for three years now not a member of the UDF" but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and deceptive way from the lack of the submission of the acronym UDF to carry out this for himself.
Furthermore, remember that this indifference is in the best way to turn into a crime, and ironically the strategy of the NC: "It appears to us, however, in politics as well as in life, that we would make a name for ourselves instead of trying to come out of anonymity by falsely making a name on which one has no legal claim".
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is convicted for exploiting weakness
On Friday, the court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, had used a weak moment of eight years to seize part of her property.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to be responsible on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the exploitation of weakness before the court, a penalty that will be imposed with a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that in fact there will be a process in this case that is worthy of the Saga of one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter are fattened and at the same time have the remains of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also conducted a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is conducted jointly by three doctors.
The successor and shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions laid down by the State Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday will present a report before 10 March 2010, which will make it clear whether and when Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she'll be subject to these investigations.
I'll talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, explained after the negotiation.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very pleased with the Court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (banier) has manipulated this old lady who needs to be protected, he confirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has filed a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of using her mother's weakness for years in order to make payments of a total of a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt, on the other hand, had always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, whom she saw as a long-standing friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of the complaint brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Mayers, the lawyers’ Playoyers led to a large family reunion on Friday.
So the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called on three of his clients to send letters (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt's husband.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years once or twice a day.
Françoise, I've never been able to speak since her marriage."
The prosecutor of Nanterre once again believes that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially because in the last few days a court judge has refused her request to initiate a court proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no prejudice.
No one has the right to act in their place," said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the State Prosecutor's representative.
The Court has now decided to give a judgment after the process for the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager's Revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Explanation?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French company, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been inappropriate ...
For over a decade, the management of large companies in relation to its employees, the company's position vis-à-vis the consumer before the marketing revolution said: It is the best thing for the staff to be "values" is to focus on how it was previously designed on consumer products by the technicians in the work.
By giving the customers at the centre of the company the marketing revolution has given the strategies of the acquisition of the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian attempt products separate factors to regularly link customer preferences!
Demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
The suicide at France Telecom, PSA or Renault is only the top of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of F&Eund, which is even more decisive, to those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economice = Economic Intelligence) "from all interested parties (...) calls for a proactive approach and a future-oriented approach"; it calls for employees to use a method that fully contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for an operational revolution which would allow employees to place their interests at the centre of the company's concerns equally alongside their customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, like the questionnaire submitted by the Orange to its payees, stimulate this revolution in relation to management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that, in view of a new situation, there are many reasons for finally reaching out to do this, ...what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power-proportional increases the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most executives have a very simplistic view of human behavior.
Advanced from the major engineering schools is their interpretation of psychology mechanistic.
They take over by intellectual comfort the old behavioral theory, which was recently reactivated by the U.S. "Neurosciences" and which was unscientificly widely disseminated by research institutes and by the media.
Thus and by suggesting that it is possible to perform the "Hebel" (sic) to engage employees, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey published by Ipsos strengthens the leadership forces in a position to a mechanical control system that is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol into any discussion or practice of the management: for the payee, it is only possible to commit to the company if it appears clearly as a means to realize part of its dreams, its ambition and its projects.
Currently only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a given doxa that allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, companies' executives can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and reposition their human resource management to the right.
They thus create a fruitful soil that is favourable to the balanced development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: the "right war" brings Obama praise from the right
American rights welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday evening and was pleased that the 2009 Peace Prize had defended the concept of "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who had ridiculed Obama's award on 9 October applauded the President's speech this time, following the example of the former Vice-Chairman in the 2008 elections.
I felt what he said, said Palin, explaining the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and adding that she herself had brought the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war into the language of memoirs published in her sermons.
Of course, the war is the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the view that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, and the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, this speech was quite historically felt, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The former Member, who was seen by some as potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "Chairman of the Left" who reminded members of the Nobel Committee that they "would not be free and could not afford a prize for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and currently editor at Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American speech".
In addition to being a "cosmopolitan" as "he always does it", he has "speaked as an American President", when he pointed out that Europeans "live in a security bubble that they have not created themselves and do not do much for their protection," says Gerson.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a falke of the era Bush, referred to on the National Review Online website as "suffering, high-level and inspiration-free".
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the return to the forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, you can simply justify the massacre on the innocent, he warns.
However, the pressure on the moderated left remains commendable on the President's side.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still the view that the Nobel Prize has been awarded to Obama in advance, called the title even for a speaker like him who is known for his talent as "Monumental work".
The Oslo speech "provides a run-off plan to control international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", says the California daily newspaper.
The New York Times is the view that Obama "declared the necessary discourse" and refers to his speech as "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Remote driver: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures the provision of Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - came to an end on Friday to an agreement that ends the strike command and the threatening heavy supply pass at Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday, the Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau welcomed the agreement which was launched on Wednesday after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second negotiation night, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly on the late afternoon.
And although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTR) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 till the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 the agreement was signed.
The conflict "was very damaging to the company" and "it was to be afraid that it would affect the holiday at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for an increase in wages by 4 % for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9 % for the highest pay groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages therefore rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not very much, but we're only starting small," says Patricia Clos (FO).
Activists are now told not to block the supply centres anymore.
"But there will probably always be some opponents who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
The TLF President Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "hard to agree on these wage increases in view of international competition".
According to him, the increase of EUR 170 per month is for the low and EUR 100 to 120 for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on a healthy human understanding and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), where Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "an historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) made a statement on this point on "an acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for an increase of 3 % in travel costs and the maintenance of the general government for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, in particular, allow the 13th month content and the modernisation of tariff agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of employers' fees of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the Government to the draft law amending the budget for 2009, which was adopted on Thursday night to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government calls for "an identical" vote by the Senate.
The signing of the TLP allows for the first agreement to apply to the companies associated with this organisation and subsequently to be applied in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour for the whole of the profession.
This will be "in the shortest time" of the case, insured busereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR Association launched a "false trade" because the 100 million euros "were already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but not to disappoint the Gans-Esser at the coming Christmas days, the Unostra complained.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens "to create a great grave for the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disorders on this weekend, trade unions not satisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on line RER A, the largest motorway network in France for the Grand Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, during a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration), which allows strikers to continue with their claims for pay.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and one of four trains was ready to be used outside the central route.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced the passengers to move.
The Galeries Lafayette shopping chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "it is the RATP that is trying to connect the major businesses by road".
The line RER A passes through the Paris Balling Room from West to East.
The section of the RATP connects Saint-Germain-en-laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of the two trains traveled on schedule for the main traffic time, and almost no one during the short traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human compassion on the railways, as the inhabitants of Île-de-France had responded to the situation.
As early as the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less than anything else, especially because of the lack of gymnasium.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), explained that he would have been extra "one and a half hours earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to passengers by staff and orderly forces, pointed out that there had been no congestion at Saint-Laza train station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Skin came or went over the Saint-Laza train station to ensure access to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikers took place again, while the results were reviewed, which had been considered by the associations after the meeting with the leadership summit on Friday afternoon as "needful".
The RER business manager proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are demanding a long-term pay charge.
The CGT was impressed that the RATP itself put its pay-up proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership was "not able to solve a problem, while this was possible with the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting was scheduled for Monday to "wide review of working conditions".
This also shows to the associations that the company "neglects the weekend drivers".
On the morning, about 150 drivers were looking for a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leading point that so far refused any discussion during the strike and brought together after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to line RER B after an announcement by Unsa and Independents.
The associations are demanding a salary allowance of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independents). They also complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are on their daily journey.
The RER line drivers who have years of professional experience include a gross salary of EUR 2,200 to EUR 2,700 and a salary allowance of EUR 600 to EUR 650 for layering services and sun and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the resolution of the country's pro-Kurdish main party; a decision followed by the prompt demonstrations in the Kurdish Community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the Government extremely difficult, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish Community to end the conflicts over 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it became a "place for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the State and its inseparable unity", says the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kilic four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kilic, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to suspend the resolution. Furthermore, he pointed out that 37 of the party's executive forces, including President Ahmet Türk and Parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, had been excluded from the political process for five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, the enjoyment of Turkey and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The leaders expressed themselves in favour of the verdict that parliamentarians would prefer to leave Parliament as partisan parliamentarians.
The decision was followed by a procedure initiated by the Turkish Federal Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalczynkaya in 2007, and he accused the DTP of following the "guidelines" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is seen by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The Party ensures that the PKK is "no connection" but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court shall function between the Government which intends to oppose the Kurdish Community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to prevent the support of the PKK by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The DTP leaders confirm that a resolution could lead to a recurrence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan's arrest in recent weeks have led to clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP's premises in the million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is mainly populated by Kurds.
The order forces used tear gas grenades and water pumps when the demonstrators started throwing molotow cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also showed up in Istanbul.
According to the case-law, Turkey assumed that the Court's decision "to further deepen despair" would continue.
"Turkey can't clarify this (Kurdish, Anm. d. Editorial) question by banning a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We object in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of the democratic openness promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously deal with a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK became known as an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey. It was one of the most brutal attacks of the past months.
A snowy break can come
This is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to blackmail the citizens, says the FES Winter Service Manager.
In particular, so that his employees can test and master the entire vehicle technology.
At the end of the week it could be so far, according to meteorologists for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is following up on an accurate plan.
As soon as it is flatly cut in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A routes will be taken off with large-scale vehicles, Brauburger explains.
These include main roads such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firefighting, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with cases such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometers had to be scattered in maximum three hours with moisture salt, which is better held.
That is why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "so that the routes are free until the trade starts".
It'll be hard if it's only cut at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because no one is willing to make room for the jet vehicles".
Only after that, so that it does not continue to cut, are the roads of transport and exit, which are also part of the road of the Council.
The last priority is side and side streets.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrians will be cleared up on the roads, hazard points and crossings.
The FES can't take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps the bridges in sight from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
Since it is on this fast layer, it is, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the current is on its way.
If necessary, this will also be called from the police.
The Waves of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-flavouring dinosaurs: the two meters long and 1.50 meters big animal walked on two strong hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with bicycles and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in New Mexico today, which was then in a dry zone of the Pangäa supercontinent in Ecuador.
Tawa opens a new window for the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us much about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaeontologists began digging on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones on one day, which is for no example for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they brought together the rest of the remaining five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it's an extraordinary fund: "Dinosaurier fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, most of them only find single fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
This is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of Bonn University.
According to the current teaching opinion, the dinosaurs first appeared some 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, so the assignment of this Ur-Dinos is most controversial.
For example, experts are discussing when the bones split into their three main development lines: the meat-freaking theopods, which were later among the Tyronosaurus reg, the Velociroraptor and also the birds known as the "long Heel" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plants-freaking ornithischia (bird-breeding parasites), for example the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found indications of air bags, as well as of the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the airbag, breathing the birds is more efficient than the mammals.
At Tawa hallae also the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive therapist with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods also later had airbags and lightweight bones, it was likely that the common approach of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs have ever lived in South America, the researchers follow that the axles appeared there for the first time.
As a result, the three development lines were separated early and spread from South America across all parts of the earth, which were still a single land mass as a supercontinent of Pangäa.
The fact is that the team together with Tawa brought the rest of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot come from a common, immigrant precedent, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are also contradictions freely.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonner Palöontologist Martin Sander.
His view could be distorted because in South America there were simply many primitive Dino fossils left, while there was little to find on other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the Reptilian strain to the dominant farm animals of the Earth’s Middle Ages, it is still formidable.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their living space with many other Reptilians, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and the aerosols and with many other axes.
By the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while the relationship at the border between the Trias and Jura died.
History of success was not eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs had survived by chance, but not the other Reptilians.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, success was not permanent.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact was caused by a group of animals that had also developed in the Trias and has been testing the mammals since then.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Cambridge, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Professors from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University hit waves worldwide.
278 professors and students from Goethe University, but also from universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarity with the Protestant students at Campus Westend.
In a declaration written in German and English, "dissident" it is the police action imposed by the Bureau.
Uni President Werner Müller-Estler had allowed the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the course of education to be removed last week because walls and works of art had been damaged.
Five students were injured.
The damage, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers by a police team".
The space is an "unacceptable intervention" in freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves as "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and derives from the contents.
The Bureau withdrew from the necessary speech.
The teachers call for the immediate imposition of criminal prosecution.
Most of the owners did not support the damage, it says.
Protest legitimate
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union federation also cooperate with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Verdi-Country Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the president and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of Vandalism, according to the CDU-Landtagsr. Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition groups saw this as SPD, green and left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the front to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of agreeing with the arguments and demands of the students, they have been cleared.
The Left has tabled an application calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on police action.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, not accessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded place in the Soviet Union for secret weapons research.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograds have contacted the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the universities and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for Closer Cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning desert Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural science research centre will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of FIZ will be allowed to walk on the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian science firms want to make orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronics, the large groups of Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist plan city" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") received its name from the forested hillland in which the research facilities are incorporated.
Stuttgart Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be put up high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the depth of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will collapse the city of the Baden-Württemberge Landeshauptstadt for a decade into unhealed construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
At that time, main railway stations with rails ending in the middle of the city were considered as transport fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brake blocks of a modern rail transport since it once took enormous time to turn locomotives from rear to front.
Get in, hold on, keep going - so you should go.
Therefore, the main railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a train station, which is located about half a mile from the trans-European rail highway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava – therefore the slogan of the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being approached, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost unpaid in the Hessian and Bavarian capital to implement the bottom line.
However, main railway stations do not have any more entry and exit problems since there are modern traffic trains with motor vehicles and tax cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE-newstreet to Ulm is now being approached.
It has been implemented by national and municipal politicians.
The train also carries the risks of the largest single infrastructure project of the Republic of the taxpayers and not of the State Group.
The project can be justified in some ways.
There is a new city space that - you think the computer-generated graphics of the planner - is equipped with a lot of green.
For the rail transport system S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the extension of the road are intended for the passenger transport, which - typically 80 years old - is attributed to huge growth.
At that time there was not the competition of the airlines.
Modern transport policy must, however, be first of all to strengthen freight transport, since transport on the rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
However, the new track does not run for freight trains due to severe increases.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly also targets many other railway projects.
A total of six billion euros is to be banned in Swabbish.
That's the official number.
Experts hold ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is true that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and nodes in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the well 180 kilometers long route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987 it has been built on the track at the time stage.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake lock.
The Rhine Valley line will be the bottleneck for international freight: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on the airport
In Wiesbaden’s Landing Day, the Government has made it clear whether it will be audited against the decision of the Hesse Administrative Court (VGH) to ban the night flight.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to review the comprehensive VGH decision in law more than 400 pages, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had stated in writing on this day that in the case of the construction of the planned north-west railway in Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The permit of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as provided by the Government of the country, is not to be agreed with the statutory protection of the population from night noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is against the verdict in the review.
The opposition criticised this delay and urged representatives of the government to give up a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Faction Chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, it would be "word break".
It's damn hard if you can keep his word, said Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir in playing on the FDP polling logo "We Keep Word".
Minister Posch rejected the proposal of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the government is trying to get to its night flights with "right-wing and trick series".
An accurate legal examination takes time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legal solution," said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group were never to be banned at night.
Paying U.S. banks help back
The crisis-scrupulous U.S. Grand Banks are stripping off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America repaid the assistance from the Tarp Bank Savings Fund to a total of 45 billion dollars (good 30 billion euros) to a strike.
And also the Citigroup plans to repay the State aid after a report by the US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions therefore want to remove the restrictions imposed on the adoption of the money – such as the restriction on the payment of manager bonds and the provision of high fees.
The Bank of America had made good 19 billion dollars of fresh money available to investors on foreign exchange loans.
The rest of the sum was taken out of its own box, which was well filled by distribution sales.
Banking chief Kenneth Lewis expressed his gratitude to the American taxpayer on Wednesday: the money syringe has helped over a very difficult time.
The cash house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to make money on the capital market to free itself from its obligations to the State.
Already on Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a serious increase in its capital of around 20 billion dollars, CNBC reported on a call for rounds.
A Citigroup speaker did not want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Select
But then everything went faster than thought.
Almost two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had pushed the incumbent editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of the office, the sender can present a successor.
Yesterday evening the board wanted to vote over the staff.
As a favourite, Peter Frey, head of the ZDF Capital Studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the sender for this - officially in order not to interfere with the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role in preventing ZDF defendant Markus Schächer from further harming the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members.
The result of the vote has not yet been established at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, the board of directors failed with his proposal to extend the agreement with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke for Burner, seven voted against him. Brander's election was a bitter defeat for cheaters, a likely one.
Because the majority of the Union in the Governing Council had already signaled weeks before the election that Burner did not want to confirm in the office.
The opposition was organised against the chief editor of the Hesse Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Burner, ZDF's messages would have been lost to trigger quotas, he refused another term of office of the highly-respected chief editor.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was cast.
Last but not least, even 35 state lawmakers have been involved in the debate, which have regarded the Kochs process as a constitutional violation.
He didn't use it.
Personal
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, teaching and Romanism.
After that, he worked for the southwestern radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey changed to ZDF, first to "today-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 Personal Rapporteur of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; until 1998 Director and Moderator of the "morgenmagazine"; until 2001 Head of the ZDF Foreign Policy; since then Head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the election of Brenders, who was still elected by the media magazine industry on Wednesday to the journalist of the year.
Koch's opposition to the Governing Council, the Rhineland-Palestinian Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should amend the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the applicant's personal proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's prospective successor, Peter Frey, had recommended a smart chess suit to the board by criticizing the board immediately after the Burner election.
Thanks to this record of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both cabinets without loss of face for the Chief Editor's posts and the Board of Directors without suspecting raising a party to the office.
Frey is still assigned to the left liberals in the partisarithmetics.
Study Disrupted
Part success for the students: After one year of the education course, the Ministers of Culture of the Countries finally agreed on Thursday: At a meeting of the Ministerial and High School Directors' Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test load: in principle, each study module should only complete with a single test.
In addition, the students' workload is to be reviewed and "a realistic and representative measure" guaranteed.
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for bachelor and master studies more flexible.
In addition, there should be no country rules that differ from them.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and uni-rectors have carried the flying word from the better studyability in their mouths.
Now it was first filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of tests in part to a drastic extent: "Every module usually closes with only one test", says a 30-page paper, which should partially regulate the approval of studies.
With the "significant reduction of the burden of testing", the accreditation board president Reinhold Grimm said, a "errorous development" should be offered content that significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, the "Studyability" will be "the crucial criterion" for design in the future.
Modules such as content are "strengthened to check" whether "unnecessary student involvement in the choice of
Events" would be avoided.
The students had "the right to receive playrooms that enable and promote their own initiatives".
The rules should apply to the authorisation of new but also to the review of existing studies.
These must be "recredited" every five years – however, which means it will take until 2015 until all studies have been reviewed.
There are almost ten accreditation agencies in charge of this, which are subject to the accreditation board set up by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture had urged the countries in October to "repeat" so that they could influence the agencies so that the dust fill was not too large and the test regime was not too strict.
In some federal countries universities and universities have already agreed on appropriate measures with the Ministries of the State.
As a single country so far, the Rhineland-Palatinate has indicated additional resources for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, universities are expected to set up, in particular, mentoring programmes and to strengthen study advice as well as audit and foreign totals.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a novelty of the Higher Education Act into Parliament.
After this, only one test is required for the completion of a study model.
The study design is intended to be more flexible, as well as to ensure recognition of performance findings at other universities and to facilitate access to the master.
By the end of the year, all studies in the country will be reviewed on their feasibility.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had once again argued about the study conditions in the country.
Besides Lob, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Council of Juso High Schools called for the development of education policy to be no longer "closed doors" of ministers and principals to be held in the future.
At the latest, after the course of education, students should now also be "students of a word".
The future academics received support from the President of the Conference of High School Directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with whom the HRK discusses a common reform paper.
The Education and Science Association (GEW) did not go far enough: it called for a legal claim that enables every graduate with a bachelor degree to access a further master's degree.
On the other hand, countries need to ensure that enough master studies are available for the present generation of Bachelor students tomorrow with the best possible study conditions, says GEW member CEO Andreas Keller.
The countries need to set up more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves on the free access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Getting into Germany and out of it is almost uncontrollable..." says the beginning line of a poem by the lyrik Werner Söllner, in which he thematicizes the experience of the arrival of a dissident who gained freedom, but at the same time lost his language space.
In 1951, Werner Söllner, born in the Romanian Banat, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's bookstore before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the leader of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
During a meeting in Munich last Tuesday, he provided for considerable extraliterary supervision, where it was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of its security records".
Apparently, Söllner left out a statement in which he made his collaboration as IM for the Romanian Secret Service Security in front of German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner had received the German language award in 1989.
The applications had begun as soon as 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted the attempts of security."
The lyrik Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and their unparalleled literary interaction with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literature scene and, in particular, the community of the German authors from Romania is frightened by a case that exposes the foundations and descent of a political system based on surveillance and speculation.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can say according to the state of knowledge, not only the perpetrators, but also the victims.
In his security act, IM Walter played a role, according to Söllner's statement by literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter on him.
He's got him in all of the difficult points for him at that time, as Markel says.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but it is not surprising that a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service was recognized.
Germany was a friendly reserve for a security hospital, Herta Müller had already written in July of the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
In some cases, those affected may be suspected to be speculated, and in some cases may also have known which names are clear behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike in the case of this country, the very process-proof view of the Stasi acts is still very widespread.
A systematic clarification has been delayed and hampered in recent years.
One of the birthler authorities of the National Council for the Development of the Safety Acts (CNSAS) was founded in 1999, but the issue of the acts has been rather detracting since.
Only since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of the acts.
The fact that the influence of former members of security in Romania is still very large, following the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview was held in which a former security chief from Temesvar spoke out against the winner.
You've got a psychosis, you've only been interrogated once.
The Infamy of Power meant to be able to express itself completely in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, the case of Söllner, as often in the context of debt, is not inevitable.
Why just now? Who was injured? The isolated reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by knowledge anxiety rather than by guilt and shame.
To the Genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who took the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Supplement to the Champions League
It seemed as if there was just a neatly dressed outdoor servant from a very nice Christmas party on which a sports product manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross went up in the middle of an orange-coloured plastic suit of the equipment one quarter hour after midnight into a retired C-class.
The man with the marked glazing allowed himself to drive because of the foreign city he was still driving.
Otherwise he could have driven himself too - alcohol was not in the game at the end, and the 55-year-old was too little satisfied before luck.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work is just going on.
Or it's just the right thing to do.
In the words of the Swiss only three days previously committed: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be confused by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "a lot more important task" was ahead of Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the King's class performance in Mainz every day.
And put down the completely reappeared weaknesses after the fast three doors through Marica (5), Tresch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Eject
The eighth final of the Champions League (Hingame 16/17. + 23/24 February/ replay 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the triumphant body of the followers of Babel remained.
Not only at the alleged health bringer who had provided the unsecured Stuttgart profession with confidence, willingness to use and fun in the short term.
I went to the players and told them that they should think about their strengths, and I stopped them to be more courageous, the soul clumps Gross explained the so simple sounding success recipe, which under Therapeut Babbel had no longer had an effect.
He invented a certain magic, Babbel's advocate Jens Lehmann said, "If a new impulse comes to football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week's break of injury due to his dynamics, progressed to the best player in the square, tried to describe the identified "phenomenon" with the word "fresh wind" and the new leader's way of working: "He is a man who asks for discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
There was obviously a lack of this among Babylon.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, Sport CEO Horst Heldt warns
But the VfB Stuttgart needs to be constant.
Like Gross, players and managers were also careful to overestimate the victory against a weak and completely overrequested defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 if the evil awakening had come, Khedira gave thought.
And sports chief Horst Heldt recalled that although one season goal has been achieved, the other is still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt was not gone after his 40th birthday even after his first home victory three months after his birthday was not celebrated was the events of the weekend, which were freshly experienced by Torhüter Jens Lehmann in the form of a television interview broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that the others make and not the Jens, Heldt counted the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had proposed leadership weakness to the board and decided to change his training to pressure puberty fans.
Even that his free day was erased after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and mistrust.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure egoism", Heldt withdrew and announced consequences for the final man.
You're probably not gonna be friends for life anymore, the two forty years.
At the same time, they agreed with all the others that without the preparations by the dissolved training team, the playful and combative idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great deal of success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man agreed with the plastic tool.
WM-Fight in Weight
Hotgies duell in Bern: The challenging Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures has always provoked again.
After 12 hard rounds, however, the Ukrainian defended its heavyweight title according to the WBC version.
The judge's judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains a world champion in weight.
The 38-year-old WBC won the American Kevin Johnson single-handedly on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after its comeback in October 2008.
In the past, Ukraine was twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't fit with the K.O. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance on 39 victories in 41 professional struggles, twice he had to fight because of injuries.
Challenged Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Berner Arena, the 2.02 meters big Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left hand.
The 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced before the duel the end of the Klitchko era, however, withdrew again and again to the battles of the world master, so that Klitchko could not reach his dangerous rights decisively.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows struck the world champion only rarely.
Meanwhile, he was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had provided for some vertebrates before fighting in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie" who can't do anything right.
At the chariot, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory by Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also won his fourth match after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of exile, he beat Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered from "his" WBC belt, which he had to give up without fighting.
This year he then forced Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Areola from the United States with his title bans.
I just got a hit in this fight and I'm physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the WBA belt is worn by British David Haye after it was able to detonate the 2,13 metres-long Nikolai Waljew in November.
Haye had already given up a battle planned for September against Vitali Klitschko in the summer.
Apparently, his promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the London Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has been described as a liar by Defence Minister Guttenberg because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left require clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following recent insights into Kunduz's air attack, opposition Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a conscious misdemeanour.
The minister said "scientificly the truth" on two tank-class trains from September, Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD message "Day Show".
It's called "land," he's been lying.
The death order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Team for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had read to Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the excavated cargo, but also about killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US air raid required by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or injured according to the NATO investigation report.
Greens, SPDs and lefters on Saturday called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to express themselves immediately before the Federal Day and also to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of the targeted death is part of the Afghan policy of the federal government - and whether the Chancellor, Federal Defence and News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green Collegiate Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The Office did not have any influence on the concrete efforts of the Federal Defence in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert were also raised.
According to SPIEGEL information, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and fully informed the background of the tank cluster attack.
Officially it had been said that they would have lied about the existence of the Nato reports and presented sensitive details to the Minister.
However, in the context of the two top officials, they stated that they had even referred to several reports by the Ministry of Defence, including a two-fold document by the commanding officer, Colonel Klein, and a field hunter report.
Wichert is now due to have asked in a letter to clarify the case, reports the "Frankfurt General Sunday News".
He hasn't got an answer so far, it says.
The Ministry did not comment on the proposals on Saturday and pointed out that this will be clarified in the Bundestag's Committee of Inquiry, which wants to establish itself on Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images and hear voices in a watchful state that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental illness and drug abuse, the boundaries between imagination and reality are floating.
As long as it happens in bed, everything's fine.
If we are closed eyes in our dark rooms, we can freely give ourselves to the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions in growth see and hear things that others do not see or hear, usually in the modern Western world as crazy or drugged, at least as special.
However, such images and voices do not only arise in mental illness or in the smoke of drugs.
Guilt has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint images or write novels also ensure that the boundaries between dream, madness and reality are floating.
Dreamfully altered alert conditions can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case wahn.
Even if triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mysticist Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic state of expression, psychosis and hallucinations can be attributed to similar processes.
Hallucinations or sensations occur when the balance of the neuronal message substances of the brain - all before dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholine - is dissolved and the interaction of various brain components is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and unusual thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between Wahn and Dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of the dream in awake condition, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great similarity of the irresin with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, insane formations, mind-blowings of such a thing".
It is autumn 2001, when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
The gravity no longer has power over him, he swims on the roof of the room.
He feels a step.
Behind him winged devilish shapes with blue, twisted phrases, teeth-flashing.
They chase him, hit him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Sound, bad voices drop out of walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and hurt him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, connects them to a hose and fastens them to a hook on the deck.
He climbs on a loudspeaker and puts his tail around his neck.
Run.
The snake's gonna get rid of it.
That's supposed to be a lesson for you, the voices are screaming in a drumming chorus, "Go to the clinic and get well!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years back, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is called schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he is taking medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deep despair, he says.
The tugs are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, in psychiatric clinics they are treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, people who are affected may no longer be able to distinguish between the inner and outer world, in a state that may lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Especially widespread is the voice hearing - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Even optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned can no longer separate importants from non-essentials, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the doors for a flow of ideas and fantasies that originate from deeper layers of consciousness.
The reality perception in psychosis is subject-centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, an observator of the General Psychiatry Clinic at Heidelberg University.
The schizophrenia is located in the center of the event, everything has a meaning for it.
At the same time he is in a passive role, he will, like in the dream, overcome by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrene therefore often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is usually not possible for them, the images are cruel reality, excluding awakening.
Once in life have experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle."
The unusual thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, and the expansion of experience is taking place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats Capriols, researchers still face puzzles.
Exceptional conditions can lead to a short-term loss of reality in every person, Fuchs says.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic mechanism for schizophrenia, but twinning studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal brain mutilation is disrupted at an early stage of development, Fuchs explains, for example, by a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy.
But it remains a mystery how the neuronal system is disrupted, which is not manifesting itself at first for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis when the mood is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they enter the transmitter system.
When our brains are hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get what the Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Kasten says.
Whether images are perceived as acceptable or unacceptable is often just a question of the point of view.
For ten years, he has been collecting reports about hallucinations and sadger appearances, and last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are one of the typical signs of psychosis, but also of amazingly many other diseases.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, including diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and skull brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain itself is a healthy person.
Hallucinations, like boxes, consist of memory contents that are normally retained.
They occur when the brain is overactive or too little inhibited, if our brain is hot or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also travel, stress, love or other mental conditions.
In recent studies up to a third of the respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visiting the gym.
A very normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and the voices.
In the break it may occur that a smart young man with long, dark hair answers it.
When he answers, the fellow students look at it as a surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They're holding the shy girl for a dreamy day dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream that she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just like she sees the girl in the bank next door.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is what she likes the boy.
I'm crazy? She sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other cartoons aren't real and disappear again.
At night the appearances are most scary
Often the tugs are also a load.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material because the teacher in her eyes and ears just presents a new student, while he explains mathematical equations to all others, hearing and visible on the table.
At night the appearances are most frightening.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which is too rare and too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming whether the pictures she sees, the frescoes or the girl with the bloody cutting wounds on her arms and legs are created in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she's yelling at the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell them anything they'd think they'd be crazy about.
In autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She's been in the Abiur last year and lives with her friend.
One year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she's been in Internet contact with the psychologist box, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Wahn is also an art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from travel, he is very likely to have after a while of hallucinations, says box.
I guess the brain is under-worked, and I'll take care of it myself.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned with 13 that the man she calls Papa has not been her physical father since she can think.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult to distinguish between subjects like Sarah K., trug images and reality. "Every experience," says box, "is in the brain, the reality is formed there.
Hallucinations are also images that give rise to the brain, so they seem so real."
Also nightly dream pictures value box as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, mental health is able to recognize their tug images as unrealistic.
Boxing therefore advises its patients to evaluate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Limit state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our very conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathology, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chefarzt of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychtherapy of Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creative horrors - it is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of the dream-changing awareness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experienced person holds for real and that he cannot in any case differ from the state of growth.
The oneiroide condition of consciousness occurs in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience a motor disorder when they are fully aware.
When a person is threatened with self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening reality situation with his own, imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is being reversed in imagination.
An intense form of sensitization and singing in an unbearable situation that enables us to be able to face our own design in nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Zürcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzeutsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness occurs after a heart valve operation with subsequent heart transplantation on trips for days, while his body is condemned at the Intensive Station for non-violence.
Clausen dives into a self-made world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the eagles who produce the fumes from blood.
When dragged by a Greek on the motorcycle in his home country, he surfes with his hospital bed in the snowshoe of the Alps and meets a Korean Mafioso.
He goes completely into the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal journeys differ fundamentally from any dream for Clauses.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are clear to me after years and in relative details.
Stronger and more intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience bursts the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
At the last end, Oneiroide, psychosis, hallucinations and drug abuse show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also being watched.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist box, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be quite enriching.
A snowy break can come
Burda
Children to take over the publisher at 27 years of age
The new publisher Callen is an interim solution: in the long term Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding is expected to account for 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children are 27 years old and are determined to enter the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have carefully regulated the details of this.
The question of whether they are active in the company is only after that.
The question is whether they are able to do so.
No 7500 employees can imagine their children if they are not qualified enough.
This also kills the children and the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he withdrew from the board's presidency from January, and Paul-Bernhard Callen appointed his successor.
The 52-year-old Call has been a member of the Board since 1999 at Burda.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury sector, the responsibility for the company's assets and after the removal of Jürgen Diedenhofer was also the responsibility for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, therefore, there is no family member at the top of the publishing.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The name of calls also serves to "break over 10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
Looking at the cases of Shikkedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies are not safe before the fall: "This has always affected families who have been on the edge of a demand for capital that have completely speculated and thought they could rise to a very big player.
My strategy never was.
He's had "no world power dreams," says Burda.
I do not see myself as the political president of this country, as it was Springer, nor do I want to play with 'Time' in the world league, these stores have grown too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the Callao (Madrid) shopping centre, where everything revolves around the care of the body.
In the area of wellness, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find among other companies, such as Hedonai, which provide for a relaxing with lasers; Spaxion, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdresser Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitone with its natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that stands out through its teahouse with more than 130 different tea varieties.
A relaxing massage together with your partner and at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or for two hours renting the relaxation area to put your own "beauty party" with eight friends on your legs and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the many possibilities that Spaxion offers.
The total area is 250 m2, divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The fitness studio also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thereby provide them with a complete personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touch screen that is opposite the devices.
Then show you various videos how to perform your training units correctly.
The head of the fitness studio ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and exercise) are fully sufficient to train the body muscles.
If then, after training your body, you still want to walk past the hair salon, the company Luis & Taci has a room in which treatments for the recovery of hair language, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalised way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of town, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 22 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletes
Christmas is getting closer and so it is once again a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and get their firm clothing in our wardrobe.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important for highlighting the Silhouette, is one of the points to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté. Of which you can only deny.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa together with the city of Barcelona has created the "LIVE office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make arrangements for mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project will be designed to promote the electric car and the opinions and actions of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and in particular to their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative that participates in the endesa with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in European standardisation groups and maintains a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the car sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied by the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace".
In presenting the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again recalled the assumptions made by the government to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, today we have a picture of the neglect and closure of some of our main production works," said the president of the government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to also produce in Spain in a highly competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided more than EUR 3 billion for investments.
The Head of Government explained that these investments are intended for the development of new models, as well as for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also stressed the Government's commitment to tightening demand, in line with Plan 2000E, which applies in cooperation with the autonomous communities and car manufacturers.
According to the Government , this plan allows emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced on average by 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in authorisations that rose by "40%" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classic Automotive Fair is held, an exhibition for experts and lovers of the world of motors.
This exhibition will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pabellón de Cristal der Casa de Campo in Madrid.
On an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will present their brands.
You can not only look at classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all just earthly articles related to the world of motors at the ClassicAuto Madrid.
In this way you can find accessories, spare parts, components, materials, accessories, publications, miniaturuts, etc. at the exhibition.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classical motors that the collectors and lovers will be thrilled.

Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a self-assembled race course in the auvene area of the exhibition site.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally compatible sports
Mazda wants to prove that sport is perfectly compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the engine's automatic stop and drive system at the Mazda3 model, baptized on the name i-stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazda 3 stands out by its good notes in the overall picture.
The finishing process, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its strike behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seats you can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good restraint.
In addition, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
In further consideration of the unit, which consists of the instrument table and the armature board, it can be found that Mazda is red and blue with a variety of buttons and switches in the visible colors, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us partly of the style of Honda Civics.
Therefore, without further ado, it can be said that both the Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, are drawn from the proximity of the German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive too comfortable by car.
To all this comes a rough and clearly shaped suitcase room.
The stop and drive system is now only available for the 2 litre petrol engine with 150 PS and a 6-pass switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out through its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not travel many kilometers per year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its gross comfort in switching and its low consumption, even though at Mazda the diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the sample is a special feature, since it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
The series equipment focuses primarily on the driver's track change assistant (RVM), which eliminates the dead angle, but also on the features of traction and stability, speed control, light-sensitive internal mirror, the table computer with a rough screen, the parking sensors, independent air-conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, and the chromed 17-inch fields.
Moreover, this version also includes, as if it was not yet equipped, the premium package, which includes the following for additional EUR 1,500: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon radios and the sound system BOSE with CD chargers.
Error
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, due to its behaviour and the variety of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not lay many kilometers a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 gas engine with 150 PS.
The only negative on this model is a slightly higher price, which is between €21.770 for the Luxury model and €23.270 for the tested sport model.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us the new highest driving pass every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls the red carpet of sensitivity for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars reflected, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose for a dark "lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can read only its e-mails without a possibility to see certain attachments or browse the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is rather unlikely to see it on the street, but the idea of it is, however, especially for young people of interest.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek only costs very little and has a very cheap flatrate, for example only half the price of the flatrate of an iPhone.
After the company saw the success, it placed two new devices on the market: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a life-long free data service, in contrast to the peak, where you have to pay a six-fold higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
However, it has the same limits, as its American counterpart, has prepared a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, approximately 12 euros a month, includes roaming for Europe as a whole.
Those who travel with a smartphone around the world already know what it means to ignore all the data in order to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the border or if you are looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with a phone).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly misleading and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is already true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but my experience requires a doctorate title in physics and a good glasses to be able to read all the small prints.
Repeated criticism by the European Commission of the available roaming tariffs for Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside your own country, you are always afraid to read his e-mails and that is right.
The fact that a small device such as FonPeek (though it is still amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have WiFi) can offer this type of tariffs means that telephone providers have to think about and start considering different ways to use their data network slowly but safely.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices the download of books and other requests on the Internet is included.
No food and no hooks.
This is an Internet-enabled device and you pay only once, that is, when you buy it, not a month for a month.
And that's exactly what I'm expecting one day from FonPeek, a shopping option with life-long internet access like it already offers in the United States.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails on the phone, thank you.
Apart from this, I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
At the time of Barack Obama's entry as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has once again chosen the same color to accompany him in his life, without doubt, the second most important moment: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models on both occasions: above that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the dress consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same fabric, and she wore something rough-shaped or necklace.
It goes so far that at first glance it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress at more than just one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the fabric from which they are made.
At the opening of the office, she wore a dress of tops and in Oslo a worn suit.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half-haired paragraphs and for the second time a delicate model, but gold colors.
The hair was different every time: the hair was high on this occasion as a hair scarf, she wore the hair open on the previous occasion.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want children.
To this end, the study carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women "Fruitability and Career of Women in Spain".
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt that 75% of women in employment see their career opportunities on the labour market as a result of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are serious differences in the decision to establish a family and there are the number of children, whether women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they practice.
Those of them who do no other work outside the house, only work half a day or have no fixed employment contract will become mothers and more children.
In contrast, women move with a firm job, especially in the public sector, the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed employment will receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after the merger, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have connected them and the first child has only achieved much later.
Auverdem also has a serious influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar on reception readiness," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account at the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to survey, age at the time of marriage and the first child is much higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they have only the primary school or higher education, on average, with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
In addition, according to their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While women with primary education are already getting married before they get their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree are getting around exactly different and are only looking for a fixed job and then getting married and then getting their first child, Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
From the coming year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the widely known ad "Because you are worth it".
The leading performer from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actors at international level, will become another famous hanger as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before you were the last to join this exclusive club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
For men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional messengers: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Electrics in Lost).
The British fashion industry's price allocation
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
For this reason they were all published.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures by Fernando Vicente) three-fold X-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear - inspiring genre (curzbiography, life and work), but looks for a similarity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent does not save on fears or lighting.
Sure, that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some cuts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual movement, just as I have always felt, without finding words for it: joy in contrast to unhealed fate, moral without guilt and innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christ, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, had, between power and ignorance, with an alluring poetic humour, without any sense, like the blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was united by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, Dermaven in her band, in whose flesh the emotions for the breakup of marriage were united with the pleasure of Reue, a spiritual privilege in which to come to heaven on the road to destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was released in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000 summits in the world literature, one has to climb up on the north wall, on the wall, where the best mountain climbers are being tried again and again."
About William Faulkner: "It was a comical caucus.
He sometimes said about himself that he would be the heir of a good owner of the county and again he said that he would be the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams testify to a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the insane cry that was taken out of a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo would continue in his literary way until the night of the 20th century. He did this on a journey on which he fled before himself and with a speech full of violence against the worms the neighborhood.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed: My God, my Lord, please do everything in your power to finally stop writing a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb these verses of Spencer are energized: 'the sleep after effort, / after the storm of the harbor, / the peace after the war, / after a long life you find delights in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depression.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on them between the Azales or singing the birds in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was even greater than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martin-Santos do than try to infiltrate Joyce in Baroja?
What was Benet's intention if he didn't bring Baroija into the arms of Faulkner?
What did Cela do except to destroy the glory of that man so that he could put himself on this ground?"
Flying Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada last week, as suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we have taken out of the animal’s home and weighs just six kilos, and then they left him two footsteps and hurt him severely.
Our equipment can't even be caught in words because it's incomprehensible to us, because the spasm is supposed to be a cheap attack against a small and helpless animal, which was, of course, carried out on the line.
In addition, the stabbing attack that a woman who went on a friendly walk came when she wanted to excuse these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a crazy person attacks a dog, he may also be with a woman, a child, an older Lord, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place in a normally quiet city district at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very usual Tuesday.
The dog's been shining all day.
Of course, we have returned an advertisement to a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this is going to be brought at all and to prevent any prejudices from beginning, but we would only like to make it clear that the notorious criminals were Spanish.
Our equipment about the event has caused us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the heads of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Transport Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote helm use, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies have announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helm use, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "is much more comprehensive than just designing and manufacturing products that are always safer with each day", and further confirmed that it also contributes to achieving a step closer to this goal every day by other actions of pedagogical and informative nature.
This new campaign to promote helm use on the motorcycle running under the slogan 'To be or not to be' is distributed in a first phase poster to over 500 motorcycle workshops to achieve the best distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and for the very reason that it is always committed to the development of ever more secure products as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles.
The sale of small trucks is increasing again.
After almost two years, the automotive market for small carriers finally starts to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in November in Spain represent an increase of 12,6 % in reference to 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first growth after 22 consecutive months of continuous decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac producer association and the Ganvam car dealer association.
However, these good figures are currently only to be generated with serious caution, as the reference data used for comparison of November 2008, which was a particularly bad marketing year with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figure of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but all vehicles from which the retail market consists include: passenger cars, pick-ups, small carriers, small delivery cars and lighter trucks/cars.
Furthermore, the same wind clouds are still in the sky, which attract demand most of the time because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private persons, the bulk of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises that make purchases with third-party financing in almost 100 % of all cases.
These restrictions, which are the consequences of the backlog of credit institutions, need to include further factors such as the increase in unemployment rates or the slowing down of the bad economic situation.
In this scenario and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of plan 2000E has not helped.
However, this plan is not only intended for individuals, but also for self-employed and small companies have a right to buy if they want to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions which may not exceed 160 grams per km run, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam recalled that it was absolutely necessary for the state to pay particular attention to these small cargoes as well as to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The car dealer association prophesied a similar year for the year 2010 as in the past, for which it is estimated with a sales drop of 19 % (in the case of passenger cars and land cars).
Support for brake control in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the ABS anti-blocker braking system and as with the ESP stability control right now, emergency braking systems need to become mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and light passenger transporters, and for the rest of the vehicles a deadline has been set until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's adoption aims to improve pedestrian protection, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many road accidents because of their working methods.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake control, which is recognised by the system on the brake pedal by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to a survey commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to enter the brake pedal and half of them had not been completely suspended.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the other hand, the brake aid will enter the brake system with maximum force and thereby reduce the brake time and thus also the brake distance which a car will lag during the brake operation.
According to an EU study each year, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake.
There would even be fewer accidents - one would expect every four accidents to be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that recognizes obstacles (over radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts accordingly, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assistant shall apply the maximum pressure to the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors shifts the plan for Opel until January
While the Opel work team in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April, probably on 8th, Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it takes more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, wants to see the affected party agreeing to each single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be moved by the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that a decision will be taken in the next few days regarding the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising, then, that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM agrees to contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skype sports car, which has the Russian group Converg back cover, is gaining stronger and stronger.
If none of these buyers were to enter into an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to land Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
The control of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewelry, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really made it easier to make it 80 kilos, bringing only 1,275 kilos to weight.
In order to create something like this, they refused as the first on the automatic mountable roof, which was replaced by a roof roof with manual drive, so that one could save 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by the exception of the air conditioning system again 13, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 litres to save another 7 kilos; by the installation of sports bacquet seats again 12 times and with the light 19-inch fields five times.
Then you also had a six-kilometer reduction through the abandonment of the audio system CDR-30 and through the exchange of the door handles through grips from material the missing kilo was reached.
Although it is also available with the double-coupling PDK drive, the test ride was carried out with a vehicle with 6-passing hand drive, mainly on the smaller country Stravens of California, on mountain routes that are really very curved.
In his driving behaviour, you can only give him the note without tadel.
The reduction of his weight, however, does not mean that he would no longer be so sure of the strike.
It is rather the opposite of the case: for a long time we have no longer tried a model so small and light, which gives a feeling of gross safety at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to make his muscles warm at a low pace in the necessary time until we give him the command to shave, to brake, to recover and then to get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything you say to him. The car does everything we show him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as well as accurate.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all taste directions
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and you can increase it even with the 'sport' option as well as through a system that can change the engine noise, which has already been used for the first time at the Panamara.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginably brutal, regardless of whether it is coming out or speeding up again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the landstraves on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the bolt holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and what we found in some of these curves was ice in the morning gray and roll split in the morning.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as otherwise it may be more rare and has much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will come to the market in February 2010 and cost EUR 70,831.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon cosmetic line and an opportunity star at the fashion shows of 'maison', presenting her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
The Basque Country Gives itself a Victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many successful players in Dusko Ivanovic's team, an excellent triumph with 82-91 when he visited the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra and thus came to the first place within his group after Mirza Teletovic's grand performance, which was with eight times the best of his team (29 in the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant accidents of Hermann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a gross dose of use and teamwork, even if they waited until the bitter end of their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blues, which started at the top on the display table.
Since the first four corps of the team from Vitoria were already coming out of the perimeter, it was already possible to recognize that they had come on the field with well-cooled wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava decided to play an indoor game of Barac and to play Elijahhu, who was received on his return to the team with Pfiffen and Applaus, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of splitter already assumes that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Despite the clear advantage of the break, however, the game was not yet decided and the Maccabees wanted to remember once again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the ever-increasing "hand of Elijah" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "yellow" turning the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but everything else than dead, had to prepare a few toys with match-safeness to get air again and suddenly came with one of them the Mirza Teletovic's pistols, which with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, made sure that the display table was shown again a calming distance from (54-67) which the host could decorate at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alavesen were bluffed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first three and a half minutes.
Despite this, Pnini and Eidson, who did not give their team their best and tried to give their team back power through three points from the line (70-77).
However, and even though splitter was set up because of mobs from the site, Ivanovic's team did not give up, well defended himself, and although the Israelites were still recovering in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Infringements prevented Unicaja from offering the stellar
Unicaja lost a lot in Greece against Olympiacos and had to join him in Group B of the Euroliga, and in a game marked by the accidents of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially during the internal game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The Málaga team had no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship or of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of Europe's strongest and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their game offered in the first quarter, the Andalusian could begin to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blended the host with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the unique Unicaja, even though the domestic team with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis made it possible that the display table in the 13th minute 22-20 showed its favor, the minutes in which, due to an action, it would have come almost to battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to get warm at last and its superiority over both parts of the game, while leaving England Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three errors caused by Carlos Jiménez's own errors left clear traces at Unicaja.
Among its players in the inner field and the Lithuanian foreplay of Linas Kleizas, with its triples, they increased their benefit in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A retrieval hunt was impossible
The third quarter of the game was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite his loss of 19 and even managed to compensate for the difference in the game carried out in Malaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which again led the leadership within the group to collapse.
Unicaya tried to remove Robert Archibald from the many accidents and the elimination of the shot injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the spring and the three times of Cook and the use of Lewis, some hope came back to 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was really impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed its superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not to be braked.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute, and Unicaja had to hit herself and had to drop the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn on Facebook because of your profile?
Facebook users can now, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, find out what they should earn because of their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the user's fees on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. The user has a Facebook form that can enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week, after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish worker "felt poorly paid" on average," explains Trovit responsible for the product, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the most badly paid according to the data about which Trovit is available by its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross amount of EUR 45.226 and a French 31.059, in contrast to the EUR 24,000 that a Spanish deserves.
Consequently, a truck driver has an annual net amount of 34.247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is the one who owns a basement with 11,592 euros per year; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and the one who works with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after places on the Internet in the last three months are one driver, half-days and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in her message in Tegucigalpa.
The President of the Office shall leave the diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest if his mandate expires officially.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" had to leave before that date the message he had found since September 21.
"He is convinced that he must go on January 27, as his mandate expires on that day and he must seek out a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the former presidents, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the set date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (with which Porfirio Lobo emerged as a winner), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried to take refuge in Brazil this week.
However, it was at Zelayas' refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeker politician who wanted to force the "de facto" government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the most elusive days since last spring in which the inflation of the assets was the dominant mood in the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, since this is its natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about a natural future.
The assumption used to stabilise the markets was to offset the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to release the liquidity free hand at interest rates that are moving around zero, so that banks would buy assets to cancel out.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets are as good as finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, begin to pour something sand into circulation as the ECB has already predicted with its annual increase next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox assumptions and we will be witnessing a reversal in reducing the risk premiums.
The fluctuations in stock exchanges and differences in corporate bonds are increasing, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states saw themselves forced to impose private risks and to raise public debt again.
It is now being re-focused on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences in the eurozone countries in terms of Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability until now, but then Standard & Poor came and threatened with a new review below regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, there is no harm to certain uncertainties in bringing the defenders of the moral risk, who had again tried to raise awareness with world economic policy leaders of what they had caused, as they had interrupted the devastating effects that the restriction of loans on job losses would have had on the fact that they should have established a new day for thank-you action.
Nevertheless, what is happening in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the emirs in order to restore power in the emirs and development in Greece has already been foreseen.
A government that deplores public guilt, elects and a new government that pulls the same strain.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary saves from non-compliance with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year, thereby allowing a euro-member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and its citizens to take over the need for over-conventional takeovers in order to maintain the stability of government funds.
Yes, we find ourselves as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some fluctuations on too high amounts, that would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt are increased at the same speed as the European corporate bonds.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish were to continue to increase, then this would be a special Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a farce. While the above-mentioned indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which again come with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all the warnings do not promise long life.
Once again it seemed to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, even though it was said in the moment "Preview for driving".

The President of Iberdola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, appeared as the first yesterday before Parliament's subcommittee, where the strategy on Spain's energy supply is being debated in these days over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán of the press gave some highlights about what he had presented to the Sub-Committee behind closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain must invest by 2020 EUR 50 billion and another 60 billion from this date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the necessary investments would not go to 60 billion but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that there should be no more investment in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, it is assumed that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under which, of course, other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is on a line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything against this law in any case about how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, it is clear that in spite of some "individual" assumptions, as she referred to the President of Iberdrola.
As far as it is concerned, Galán believes that the investment decisions should be made now, even if they are long-term, because it will take some time and a stable compensation framework is needed to tackle them.
Ferrovial receives the "handling" from Aer Lingus on ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swiss airport, is the preferred partner of the Irish carrier Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no figures have been announced so far, shall be drawn up for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50 % will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to investigate energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Actiona competes with Hochtiv and Bouygues for its first construction in Australia
Actiona fights for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The building is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Supremes are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Actiona to establish itself as a construction company and a motorway operator in the country.
The city administration wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration had decided on a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to proceed with the project according to a business plan set up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and construction.
In view of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amounted to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia competing in the last phase, mainly from European construction companies.
The group named Transcity is led by Actiona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best construction specialists.
Against the team of Actiona, the Northern Direct Consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructures and the French building group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrowest election, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Lightton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtiv, which is also part of the ACS), which also owns domestic construction stone (in possession of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises powerful construction and privatization, however, has a toughness to overcome, since it is only through the purchase of a domestic construction company.
A strategy that is followed by the said companies Hightief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which must only be followed by the Spanish builders.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only by its participation of 30% to the highest level, the owner of the said Lightton.
Millions of Active
Actiona places the highest importance on this geographical area for the industry, where it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desulphurization industry.
Among other assets, it has already built its deep wind mill park (192 MW) in Victoria and has led the group of companies that were commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's drainage plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure.
The underground route, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and being connected to Northern Link (Northern Zümringer), aims to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the surrounding Strave in Kelvin Grove (see map) at a length of 5 kilometres through the tunnel. This is the gross takeover of the dams on the Straves of Brisbane.
The roadmap issued by the city administration will provide for the award of summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this route is to open up for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction works will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two driving tracks in each direction, an electronic system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland participates in funding with 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million).

The ACP subsidiary will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fibre cable through its domestic subsidiary Lightton.
This improvement will create a fast internet access for 400,000 people and the German company will employ for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower's construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction works have not yet begun and it has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment amounted to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has spent over its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometers long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after receiving the award for construction works to extend the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine enhances his experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction works is planned for early 2010, and its implementation will take 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years by Mrs Rushmore over a sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company reported.
This agreement also provides for two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that presented the competition written by Renfe, of which 4 came to the end, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on Mrs. Rushmore will be commissioned with the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty of over 63 million for France Télécom due to the suspension of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a fine of more than EUR 63 million for anticompetitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on fixed networks and phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and trust programmes for consumers at the border of regulation.
Together with this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state-owned companies have collected more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 due to the disability of its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was even increased, since the competition authority believes that France Télécom has committed similar crimes in the past and has therefore become backward again.

On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading page on the Internet to increase revenue from non-phone business.

The game at the Champions League has invested 476.4 million in Madrid and Barça since the beginning.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has developed into a source of revenue for the football club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since, which brings them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that earned most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win the UEFA Champions League, not only brings glory to itself. It is also one of the main revenue sources of the major associations.
According to the UEFA, the League has distributed up to EUR 5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish) that have participated in this event since its establishment in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The woman club is located in Europe's third place, which earned most of the money through its participation and the only one who won the trophy three times alongside the AC Milan.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is the fifth.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that took up most of the money through their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, even though they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third place of the countries that could take money through the Champions, although it has more title than all others (five, unlike four bee Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated allocation procedure used by UEFA.
This financial year, the organisation, whose president Michel Platini is in, is counting with revenue of 1,090 million by the Champions League.
From this money, UEFA 413.1 million is available for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualification round (including the Atletique de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million due to their blobe presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for an undecided (400,000 per team). The clubs that have come to the eighth final receive three million each; the four that have come to the fourth final, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second one, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and at least 31.2 million on fixed income.
Barça won again with his victory at the European Supercup in August 2.5 million.
However, the variable payments for which 337,8 million are provided are still included.
This money will be given in proportion to the value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 allocated seats.
The master of the last year receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The group of Nueva Rumasa yesterday has been able to secure details of the purchase offer of shares, with which it wants to acquire an upper limit between 25 % and 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public call (opa) due to the number of shares.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share paid up to ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed with EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below market value.
According to Nuuun Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real evaluation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The group from Jeréz gives shareholders a period of 15 days to notify their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV ensured that it was not informed about this offer, although Ruiz Mateo’s company confirmed that it had contacted the Authority.
At the end, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to develop its management.
In the attempt to remain on the edge of possible purchase offers and the judicial sources of his former manager, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal book inspection.
A decision to become the first woman to have a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post that is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is all but free of controversy because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of the suspicion of converting more than 230 million of Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos is shifting further capital over the next month.
Regarding Salazar's credit yesterday, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) arrived before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without their consent.
CNMV approves the public exclusion invitation to tender by the investment company Mer
The National Borrowing Commission (CNMV) approved the public invitation to tender for Federico Paternina, submitted by the Investment Company Mer, on 9 October.
The Authority stated that it had approved this invitation after it had been proved that the conditions of compliance with the law could be considered "sufficient" according to the amendments made by 2 December.
CNMV also announced that this offer for the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paterina at the price of EUR 7.65 per share, which is again 8.95 % of the company's capital, which consists of EUR 6,142,786 in shares admitted to Madrid and Bilbao.
Auverdem was further informed that 5,592,778 million shares were fixed which could not be transferred until the end of the invitation to tender and whose price of Federico Paternina was determined in accordance with the law.
New vehicle monitoring programmes
In these days of accidents and accidents, not only do KFZ workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles that have been in an accident are dragged into workshops where a judge has to assess the damage caused and the cost of repair.
No single accident is the same as the calculation of costs for parts and working hours can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between EUR 20,000 and EUR 30,000 per hand, including parts and working hours, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest IT tools, it is a question of minutes
For this reason, almost 100 % of respondents use these types of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex is part of the American group Solara, the market leader; 80% of all reviews are produced with their products.
The two other companies competing with the tool market for the assessment and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, he is working with 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing the information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is becoming worse and worse, to the point that even more versions, variants and motorizations have been on the market in the last five years than in the past fifteen years.
As soon as a new car arrives on the market, business starts to work.
It is a difficult task because each of the thousands of vehicles must be catalysed and their price entered.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphics image on which different parts of the vehicle can be "clicked".
If this is a very sold model, the work can be completed in one week if the procedure is carried out in a timely manner.
If this is a less useful car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Audatex has 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain with complete information.
For example, among the exclusive models they have information about Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle fleet running on the Straves, there are more than 99 %.
For the purposes of carrying out documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (usually specialists for mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive the updates every second day.
The development of this huge information flow allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on country, there are also tools for managing scar tissue or for calculating the fault or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, you can easily provide an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the AudaPlus products, a standard solution for accident detection for the investigators.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs for the parts, it contains the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid according to use, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive will be for customers who rarely use it, up to ten times a month, that is 5,75 euros per month.
On the other hand, each insurance company, which produces thousands of opinions, negotiates the price with Audex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, can be fully identified by means of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came from the assembly band.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle drives, and AudaSubbastas is an open service market on the Internet that can be offered for vehicles that have been declared to be totally damaged.
Its statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analysis or for obtaining information about variations by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a particular car brand were forced into the workshop because of tires or how many of them were in a serious accident during a certain period of time.

Cost proposal of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost proposal in just four steps:Identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of a cost proposal.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older professionals that are normally more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger power vehicles, 109 land vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small carriers and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the vehicle identification number, a graphics of the respective model will appear and then the required spare part will be selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, premiums or discounts and then print the cost proposal and pass it on to his customers.
AudaTaller is, however, not a tool for evaluating such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that this does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is EUR 350 per year, an amount that the customer can pay without further payment.
At the moment, the company Audatex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that has been waiting for auto mechanics for a long time since you can choose a door with them, for example, and then turn the image completely to look at the inside.
