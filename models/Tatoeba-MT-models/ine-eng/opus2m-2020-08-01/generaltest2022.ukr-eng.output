Green: Mariupol, the heart of war, will stop fighting, we will have weak positions
President Vladimir Zelenski believes that fighting for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupoli, will determine the course of war — and if the U.S.A. is defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and reoccupy deoccupied territories.
The real language is, "Mariupole is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It's fighting, we're fighting, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have weaker positions.
They (the city’s defenders) are people who have drawn a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupoli, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) of the OSS, and if they're stronger, the conference table will be closer to us and we'll have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a situation that is weak in all these directions, we may not be expecting a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to the return even to the cities that we've been depriving of.
They can go for it.
Then our situation in the talks will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we do.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory..."
Details: Greeny also said that going to the negotiations after the beatings of the Ukrainians is difficult, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they're in our possession."
Directly, "People will take peace at any rate because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something -- and I don't think they will be satisfied with any peace under any conditions.
But if we don't talk emotionally, the war should end in peace, or it'll end in millions of victims.
And even where there are millions of victims, everything comes to an end to the war.
Yes, we must fight – but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing left, there's no people."

Well, I've got the money for two months of rent, and the area in Olomouca doesn't matter, and I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of animal abuse from the civilian population to the north of Kiev.
The photographs of the slaughtered and shot people have disturbed the entire civilized world.
Tens of people ask each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?
And it didn't surprise me at all.
I drove my children and older parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then a girl-college with the kids, and only after that did he go back to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have been consistently helping the U.S.A., and I have no doubt that my family will not be spared in the event of the occupation of Kiev.
Because I was and I'm absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror he just can't exist, he's built on terror.
In 1937 one of my ancestors was shot in a prison in the city of Gitomir.
A few years ago, a copy of the GSB was removed from the scattered predicate case: the whole case was over a hundred pages, and the sentence to death was much simpler and even more frightening.
The defendant was illiterate, he denied the guilt.
An ethnic pole, a Catholic, had five children, was from a free people, a poor "one-door" path, never walked in the hippies.
The fact that they lived in caves and had several cows was sufficient to provide food for young children to die.
The parents did not even know about the burial site.
My grandmother said that about a hundred people were taken from the village at the time and killed all but two people who agreed to give a false witness.
In the criminal case, there's the name of Sharia's knocker.
Our former High Council speaker comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I'm not surprised if his relative was the CDBist informant.
Apple from apple near, as you know, falls...
The devastating three that had been attributed to the loss of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
In his analysis of the case, he was interested in a variety of information resources.
There are great (no sarcasm-free) information resources in Russia, such as the "Immortal Barack," which remind us of the events of those years.
So in modern Russia, the descendants of the NCVDists have found ways to punish and eliminate almost all who have seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of victims of Stalin’s repression and publicly wrote the names of the killers were first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like they found files with child pornography on their computer, they put her in jail, and she died quickly.
The CDBists are now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
Why, then, do you suddenly wonder about their actions now?
It focuses on the most debased traits of human nature.
Over the thousand - year tradition of the Order, slavery and imperial chuvinism were imposed in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then over what happened, they did an animal genetic experiment, cutting the intelligence over several waves of red terror.
Look at the 1992 half-French film "Czechist", that's all.
You saw my photo in the bathroom.

As "European Truth" reports, the world is writing about this with reference to sources in government circles in Ukraine.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economics of Germany on Saturday.

In the shortest term, the Bundesver will give Kiev 100 its shells, and the gaps that have been created will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new hoods can be placed 30 months after the contract was signed, or before the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.

4. In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine can ask for humanitarian aid at the new workplace of the Office of Labour in the Prague Market.
The branch in Room No.29 is specially designed to provide and process applications for help, so there is a translator in place.
Lydia was already brought to school, but we're going to see the teacher on Tuesday.
I sit, I keep my ears on, I listen to music, and I think about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, honey, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I'm dealing with it like we're together.
I'd say after the war there'd be a lot of work.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what it's like to live.
I need to go through the food license exam, and can I do this for you?
Please indicate tomorrow for 5 guests to cook the apartment.
The fifth place I understand that way in the TV room?
Plan and land the sofa?
Can we stop until Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one they used, but he's working, but he doesn't have to.
Write a Czech address, let's look at the map where it's from us.
I don't know how much free space there is so I can't plan anything with furniture this week wants to finally look at that apartment and then figure out what furniture I need.
I'm sorry she answered so long, it was a day's work, it's hard to adapt
That's enough?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I finally want to be with you, to have such a chance to hug you.
To kiss you in the morning, to tell you how you feel.
For the kids, there's a bed and a bathroom, things have been found for the first time
Don't forget that you promised to help me, how you'd be able to do it, but don't give up the last.
I want to make a cut called the hat.
Oleg is sick, he's thirsty and coughing, and she's better off not taking her to us so she doesn't get infected.
I'm just gonna be a little bit later at 8:00, okay?
I don't want to misunderstand you.
Because I'm making sure everything's okay?
Because with these excursions we didn't even talk about it!
I understand how important this is to you!
And I'm talking about myself (for me it's just the top I can't reach!)
How do you feel today?
Hi, I'm sorry, I just woke up, I slept bad.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was disappointed that Cole and I had begun a bad translation of the test yesterday.
I will ask whether Gregory Denisenka or Ionashek) to help me with a little bit of math.
Can I be of any use to them?
If that's possible, I'd like to draw mathematical terms out.
Geometria is difficult at all, but we have to work with Cole in such a way that there's no error.
Thank you for the test job
We're looking forward to it too.
And that's how she likes any gift
I wanted to connect to my Czech number on the Internet
Last night at 402 bus stops, I met a Ukrainian named Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we agreed to be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine to feel my affection.
The branch in Room No.29 is specially designed for the submission and processing of applications for assistance
Turns out I ordered a backup card.
No, I'm just a man.
So she wouldn't be afraid of anyone coming.
I didn't go, yeah, it's hot, I can do it, the main thing you taught me is to turn the ghost on.
So you've been out of town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Holocaust Centre Babin Yar, in Kiev, we held 80 years of mass shooting by Ukrainian Jewish soldiers in Babin Yar.
I had the honour to perform after three Heads of State, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We need to protect this base, which is also part of our responsibility to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in a new dress," he said, "for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must go on."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of peacemakers, starved the people of its fortified cities and allowed them to die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shoots of Ukrainians, even visually reminding them of the shootings in Babin Yaru.
For more than a month, Germans see it in real - time news.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons that have not been so far imagined.
Germany is slowing down the supply of heavy weapons to Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to speak against swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way to conquer evil without risks and victims and stop the beliefs that are taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, make an appointment for a trip, and write down when we meet
All sick only Lydia wasn't sick in them was the micron of a new species of cod
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
I'm using this tablet instead of kara
Make sure you're late.
The ticket cost me a 2000 shot.
Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership ceased to be a far - reaching prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were opposed to NATO entry and only 18% of respondents were "for".
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Victor Janukovic, the annexation of Crime and the beginning of the Donbasi war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the supporters, on the contrary, grew.
After the beginning of the war, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record of Ukraine's support for NATO's entry among Ukrainian citizens, more than 75%.
Despite Ukraine's support for NATO's accession and the aid that NATO is carrying out in war conditions, there are now many criticisms on behalf of the Alliance and the members of the country -- for the inconvenient supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "warn" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to renounce the desire for membership in the Alliance through the position of the FF if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military.
In the new episode of the Cursed Issues, together with the editor of the European Truth, we talk about how Ukraine helped the Alliance from the time of the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticised for, and why the Alliance is criticised in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is as close as ever in history and why the security guarantees discussed in Russia's talks can become another Budapest memorandum.
How do you think it's here?
I have a volunteer partner who says that my application is under consideration.
I gave it to her because of this mobile plug-in.
There is no visas, we need to go to the convention center and learn how to do it because it was designed in Poland, there were no visas, and there was no pessimism.
We'll have to write you!
Dennis was in a good mood today.
He agreed to meet with a boy from Ukraine he met yesterday at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's all right.
Because then I don't love, I don't have enough.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tank to Ukraine and war trucks to leave.
I'm going to leave my kids alone waiting there for 3-4 years and I'm going home because I can't leave anymore.
And take six to seven in the morning.
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a sincere feeling about this man, but he did not do so well and I left him.
After a while, he came back and apologized to me.
I turned him down.
Then, after some time, he telephoned what had been done in his heart.
I asked him to talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost half a year.
During this time, we had a lot of conversations.
I had problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at that time.
That's the kind of help.
And I thought maybe I should really look at him differently.
And he offered to marry me, and he died two days later.
That is why God has decided our own destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find a place to live, and I am very happy that I now have a place to live and a place to be with a child.
Did I need to be mentioned earlier?
( 1) I helped to see children in the family.
Don't apologize, just write what you didn't understand.
I understand that the translator does not always translate the text correctly
I don't know how to talk to a doctor. Should she give the paper?
It must've been the guests who forgot. I put them in the closet.
Maybe it's time for you to go to bed to work tomorrow.
Can anyone help the necessary things for a woman XS or S raise 165.A also for her daughter (8.10.12 years old) Thank you.
That time in the ice I bought two packs and my mom bought two
It's very nice of you, thank you.
You've made me feel better.
Okay, give me something else, and I don't sleep, I'm still asleep, and I'm dreaming of being bombed...
God will never be late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me:)
I have a great understanding of the price of unskilled work, and I realize that the kind of work I had at home in Kiev I can't have here and the money I made at home, and I won't get here right now.
But just sit down and do nothing, I can't do anything, because then every bad thought in my head goes down, so you have to do something physical.
At the airport, documents are produced from 7 a.m. to 7 a.m., otherwise we can just wait.
Volodimir returned at 4:00 a.m.
That's why we took them to us.
We arrived with Wik in the kitchen, put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go with them to the airport.
When you have it, write it down and find out what's next...
And then I can't find a place anymore.
Sir, please, these are Ukrainian children's invitations to enter high school.
Yeah, but I'm doing it hard.
Okay, write me when it's convenient.
With work I don't know.
That's what we planned.
I'm sorry, I really don't have missed calls in the middle.
I offer work, cleaning the bathroom and the toilet, washing 3 windows, cleaning the dust.
It's about 3-4 hours.
I hope I'll just tell you that we're all right.
Can I call you?
Or could you write down your wife’s contact?
Grisko started coughing, I want to ask what I can buy in the pharmacy.
I want to ask for advice.
Anna is considered to be the root species of Anja
She was handed over by her uncle.
Making English Versions, Adding New Partners
Write to him if you need anything.
Just don't forget about me, please.
Are Mondays and Wednesdays different?
Thank you very much, you're doing a lot for our family.
Help is needed to be in the pool
But that's my idea.
My uncle gave her the rolls and the board for the kicking, and she ran into them at home, so it's got
I also got up at 9:00, and I'm just cooking breakfast.
I'm very ashamed that you're communicating with me on your way out, and I hope I'm not very boring.
We want to notify you of a change in location and together provide documents for the extension of the map
We're now giving medical oxygen to all the hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you there's going to be a taste tomorrow.
One mother said it's safe for kids to have a bowl of chicken.
He's coming to you at the party.
Please tell me, and do you have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments a month ahead, though for an approximate understanding in which days?
I don't remember this schedule at all.
The Russian army threatens to launch missile attacks on Kiev: they say, "They haven't done it before."
Directly Konashenko: "We see the attempts at diversions and attacks by Ukrainian troops on objects in the territory of the FF.
If such cases persist, the RF armed forces will strike at decision-making centres, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has been held."
The Russians have been hit by rockets on Kiev since the first days of a full-scale invasion of the RF occupying forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, Russia’s rockets that broke down Ukraine’s PHO system fell into a multi-quarter building in the capital’s Poznak.
On February 26, Russia’s missile hit the multifaceted front of Valeria Lobanovski.
On March 1, the Russians engaged in television on the Roads near Babi Yaru, resulting in the death of five passersby.
On March 2, Ukraine's P.O. systems crashed over the South Railway Station, Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defence's building.
On March 14, the wreckage of the bombers broke down the building and the trolleybus in Kurenevac in Kiev
On March 18, Russia’s missile hit a residential mass in Vinogradara, one of which died, another 19 were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville TRC in Winegradara, resulting in at least 4 deaths.
Mer Kieva Vitaly Klikko reported everywhere on April 13 that residents of the capital were evacuated from the city until they returned early.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still cause rocket attacks on Kiev, as well as in the vicinity of the capital, many mines and unbreakable ammunition.
On 12 April, the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence's investigation was warned that the Russians were planning the first series of acts on the territory of the FF to blame the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army in relation to the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil tank exploded near Belgrade in Russia as a result of an air raid by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local authorities of Belgrade claimed that the "Ukraine snorkel" had fallen near the city.
Apparently, the elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing themselves into the cold pit from the very idea that Russian bombers in the sky will be hit by Russian bombers in Ukraine.
But the Greens don’t talk to them as much as they do to their voters and communities in general.
By his speeches in the parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the areas of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Green is not convinced European politicians to do everything for Ukraine; it is convinced of this by European nations that choose those politicians.
And these discourses, this refined flow of power, sensitivity, and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Bayden categorically opposed the closure of the sky, 70% of its fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against speeding up Ukraine's entry, this process is already under way.
I understand you, so you don't want us to be jokes.
The cost you are going to collect is better than giving to people who need more.
I can come to you and we'll figure it out.
But the air is clear, it's plus
There it says I've got a "Razom on two without the Internet" tariff, I asked you to do the Internet instead.
I don't understand the terms of the tariff
Do we have any other accommodation today, or do we always have just the stairs down?
So I'm on my way and you're on your way.
But I won't stop loving you, you're all for me.
This is done by a financial consultant.
So it takes a few days.
Who asked for the Internet, could you give her a password?
I thought you and Milana didn't shoot each other.
Great then my husband will take me because he has a car from the company where he works.
How happy and grateful we are that our Nick and his grandson are under your protection!
Thank you very much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!
One must be cut into 4 parts.
One of these parts can be used for 2-3 days, but every hour it's a pleasure.
I'm interested in architecture and color
I'm so glad you're all right.
Soon, at 16:20, the concert will start at 6:00 and then I'll be free again.
And now I want to eat something sweet.
I'll make some tea and get some sugar.
I'm going to go to school and I'm going to try to order Annie's lunch tomorrow.
But to play on the exits in great love
So we can get there tomorrow, find out what the conditions are?

I'm a certified massager and nurse with a 27-year-old intern in the field of neurology.
I offer medical massages, a rehabilitation training room for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian, and Czech.
Contact: ----- I would like a letter to be able to write to you through the translator, text messages are not here, they don't have Ukrainian keyboards, and if they call you, you won't agree.
You really don't want this price?
He is very helpful to people to see what they are worth and what they have for it.
If you don't need a passport, I won't put it.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
By the way, you didn't want me to write today... something.
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
More specifically, today I'm just asking for attention.
I want to say a lot today, so I'm asking you to be patient.
Are you all right with the idea?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, vacation.
You have a dream.
You're going to buy that dress you saw last night at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't understand that.
He's squeezing for the old reality.
You call for work, find out if you're going to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
As long as there's something clear.
There's hope... it's not long.
Now... we'll make a deal... there'll be something.
The brain refuses to accept...
I don't have anyone or anywhere.
I've got $50 in my pocket, and we've spent everything at home.
Many of whom were hired by our leaders did not pay for our work.
Where am I going? Who do I need?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't get anything out of the house... you're 1,000 miles away.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you pull the kids all over Prague.
I don't know, kids are asking for candy, and you can't.
And from every tribulation, we don't have one.
We have a choice to stay there and call children at risk or try to save ourselves here.
She was very happy with the heart and the things that her children gave her when she came to school
I had to call you when you got here.
I'll write you dinner.
Yes, I believe in God and trust in him
I don't have the strength to do this anymore.
I thought you fell in love with some Ukrainian girl and you don't have time to talk.
I picked up the menu, I even ordered
2. Would you be interested in sharing with your Czech neighbors, friends, and communities?
If that's the case, what kind of guy is it?
Please send the page with a visa or stamp (red with date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian aid.
Mrs. Libushe, have you paid for this?
Because I can't understand.
You are doing us so much good....
We owe you a great debt... thank you!
Yeah, I understand that's very good.
Now I'm going to take your picture of the lady's visit that I'm teaching English to you.
Well, if you write tomorrow, we'll see you or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We have enough resources. It would be so good to know a man from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
You're busy tomorrow, don't you want to meet after 4:00?
What General Impressions You Have From the First Week
Karina brought us drugs in the evening, and we're drinking them.
I can work with sick and disabled children.
But I have to say that I only speak Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have one.
I can wash you nice for the dishes.
Because there's only a gel antibacterial.
I'm not going to say, because I'm not very oriented in town.
What services/activities do you think are needed/not available for people of advanced age?
I don't know because there wasn't a text from the bank yet, and I didn't take the bank's cards, and the kids even removed the bank app.
Then please write me how you're going.
Today we have the joy of freeing our city of Bucha from the occupations, our armies.
There's a cleanup from the enemy. They're looking for Russians in the basements and in the apartments.
The whole city is being replaced, the trade is about to begin.
And John would look, maybe something needs to be repaired or something else done.
Maybe he'll be ashamed, I don't know.
Our Panas wants to stay home, says he's tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We're going to take out the masquerade and do the lessons.
These are small businesses that witnessed volunteer headquarters in their homes and shops.
They're tractors that actually go out in the field under fire because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who today agree to drive in vans in temporary occupied areas to get help and get people out of there.
These are heroic leaders who fearlessly drive in the fighting zone, calm and help refugees in their cars, and at peaceful stations help volunteers to load in their vans.
These were the drivers who stood on the Gitomir Trail in the first days of the war and patiently served the frightened and nervous people.
These are the Communals that take away garbage, repair pipelines and power lines to provide people with the necessary supplies.
They are doctors and nurses who save people at 24 hours a day without complaining, and they are still volunteering for a free minute to collect drugs on the front.
We're in Ukraine, we're out of silk when the little ones have leaves.
Tell me, please, what age do you mean?
My daughter, eight years old, is that acceptable?
I'm looking for a room with my daughter for 3-4 days to come to the Czech Republic and transfer passports to make a visa in Canada.
There's a lot of people in Warsaw at the travel center and they don't work online.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, taking a long time on the train, the kid's gonna be hard.
So she decided to search for a place in or near Prague.
No, we're all set up.
Yesterday's Devices to Load
But I can't change the password when I'm going through the link because I'm making the following mistake:
It's in the microwave. Something's burning.
In Ukraine, the largest bank operators are always in contact with customers 24 hours a day, and all issues are quickly resolved :)
Nothing, I'll get used to new realities.
I'm very unhappy, and I want you to know.
You can edit the letter, and most importantly, there's the truth.
Yeah, TV's full of it.
We've already arranged for the refrigerators to respond to some Czech boys at 1 p.m. and help move.
I want to go to you.
at 7.30 I read the story of the world theatre to actors, directors and theatres
I appreciate the projects tonight. After dinner.
Grisko still sleeps. He's crying a lot at night. He's licking his teeth.
Now I'm on the phone with everyone I know from Lviv, a lot of people died.
After March 22, the Czech Republic began to issue visas to me.
Until then, they put prints like this and then they compared these prints to the visas.
The Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (KWO Ukraine) is a electoral district that brings together the voters of a factory located outside Ukraine's territory and consists of premises for voting in Ukraine's embassies and consulates and military bases abroad,[vinoska 1] on which Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and the Congo) are located.[1] The role of the District Electoral Commission for the Foreign Electoral District is carried out by the Central Electoral Commission.
There are only public elections in the Foreign Electoral District: the election of the President and the national deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections do not take place.
They're at the train station near the mother's and the baby's room.
He says he doesn't understand where they're going anymore.
Are you mad at me?
I'll take a photo in the bathroom.
I don't need money anymore. I've been borrowing for a long time.
I wanted to say that I've already connected the Czech mobile number.
So I didn't need another device, I went to operator O2 and they made me an electronic SIM card that I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
Thank you. I'm very uncomfortable, I can't work Sunday and I can't.
You said you had a broken washing machine.
We don't have enough blankets, wind blankets, plates. Kids don't have pajamas and there's nothing to move into.
Good morning, I'm going to go out at 10... write the address again.
I don't want to torture you or myself, I'm gonna break in with this.
That would be good, but I know there was no free space, and in principle they now have all the lessons on schedule and they teach pretty well.
Do you have a meatball to make a pharynx?
Let's go after noon.
Did your mother tell you yesterday that something hurt you?
She can't tell them everything she wants, and she doesn't understand everything they say.
I went to school today too.
I saw Christine’s mother today, but she did not even greet her.
A very delicious apple, what kind of apple is it?
The head of President Andrey Jermak's office reported that Russia was beginning a "faecal operation" on the weapons that the allies are handing over to us.
Directly from Jermak: "They understand that they lose war, see their distance and want to "beat" the arms of any method.
For example, one of the last faeces was the destruction of the Soviets of the P-300.
This information has already been simplified by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
We know Russian scenarios, one of them.
They can launch pheasants who Ukrainian soldiers often give up arms from allies, and they masseuse into the arms of the Russian army.
I want to warn these fakes right away.
Because the weapons in the hands of U.S. soldiers are sending the enemy to the world.
Excuse me, please, but I forgot to ask you how much bull to cost the garden in the month and is it going to work in the summer?
Each one is given in his own strength.
There's a lot more dubious stories, trust.
So I had to survive these events to change.
Tori wrote, and God created in man a bad beginning for her to change spiritually during her lifetime
It's your home, you can invite anyone you want.
How do we find this lady in the cemeteries tomorrow before we go to the hospital to see the rat?
He listened to my mother and didn't come with us.
I know it wasn't easy for you.
And I'll do everything I can to make you happy.
After you wrote to me today, I'm happy.
I hope you mean that.
I'm looking at the announcement already busy. It's so hard now for us.
I'm sorry, I didn't fully understand the question.
Didn't you make a phone call today for a change in the fare of the mobile operator?
I'm sorry, but I can't expect anyone in this life.
Today I was offered a job every day.
I'm sorry, but I agreed to work there.
Thank you for responding and I want you to find a nice assistant.
Your father may have told you that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses among us, but I do not preach any religion.
However, he was baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all religions that are the basis of love.
I read the Bible, the Koran, and started reading the Torah.
I believe that there is no mediator between man and God.
You can still think about not putting a refrigerator next to the door in the boys ’ room.
Thank you very much for helping me.
We're looking for a locker for the usual cleaning of the village here.
Proposal 150 kroner/year. Another collaboration with them. Date to agree with the lady.
I'm afraid I'm afraid of chemical care.
I'm just worried about how we're gonna communicate with you.
But we can just look at each other at each other's jokes.
I went alone to my mother, and there my sister and friend were going to go, and Anastasia asked them.
Where's your good wig?
On the good day, Victor approved this house just doesn't know how to help this gentleman with documents to get paid from the state and said that with the furniture bank while there's no furniture available.
And thank you very much for your hospitality in your seat.
We've got good doctors here, too.
We've been cooking food at home, and we can't find the keys from the heat.
I'll take the underwear for the fifth guest, and the pillow and the suit are extra in the apartment?
Yeah, but how to connect with the owners, there's no contact, I need a long-term residence we work and we can pay, help if you can.
At the end of each description you have a contact with the owner.
For communication, you can use this online translator from Ukrainian to Ukrainian and vice versa.
I'll have four of us in one bed in the room where you can't even go around, thank you very much.
Well, did you click on the links I sent you above?
Each one of them has a free offer, a description, a contact with the owner and a photo.
I can't find any contact just by email. I'm afraid I don't have anything to do with what kind of a place closer to the Czech Krumlova we work in the Czech Krumlova and we're now living in Prague.
Then I won't help you.
Thanks for the help, we found a place, but we need a bed and a couch, you might want to tell us where to buy a cheap budget because we're weak, thank you very much.
Can you say he eats bad and he often hurts his stomach too?
I saw your publication on the Music Project.
I'm the National Pedagogical University Hormester No. Dragomanov.
I'll be happy to cooperate.
In the meantime, Russia displayed its missile complexes on the border with Finland.
They want to try not only Ukrainian penis but also Finnish
I'll be the happiest when I'm with you.
When I wake up with you.
I'm telling you, "Good morning, darling, you look very beautiful."
Where can you buy a hat with the ears moving?
There's a lot of work to do today.
Aren't we holding you back?
You don't have to pass that on the inscription?
That's enough of you talking to her, and I want to understand you.
I'll take a look and tell her.
But it's good that you're all right, by the way, and it can't be!
She's lying on the bed, Sasko's beautifying the pancakes for her in the kitchen)
It's a very heavy fat, and it's on top of the glass.
It says that the request for humanitarian aid is made.
The application must be completed in the Office of the HR.
And show this third code.
So I asked online, but I had to make an application to go to the Labour Office.
I'm scheduled for Monday.
I bought the phone number.
My Slavic is not enough on this day (
Are you coming back tomorrow?
The child has a high temperature for a week and a dry cough.
We want to see you and we're already sad for you.
Are you interested in how everything affects our brains, creating new neurons?
Getting used to it?
A set is available at the spring collection season in the districts of Mělník.The living room is provided, well paid.More details on phone 729 725 522 498 168
We cleaned up the whole room and moved into another room.
The international coexistence continues to express shock and resentment after evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these messages as a “provocation. ”
"Reports of the killed, raped and severely wounded by Russian troops of Ukrainian peacekeepers are worth the condemnation," New Zealand Prime Minister Jasinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on 4 April.
"Russia should be responsible to the world for what they have done," she added, saying that her government would discuss further steps to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kissid called incidents "a violation of international law".
After reports of hundreds of peacemakers being shot and thrown into brotherly graves or left on the streets of the capital city of Kiev, in Buchi by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photographs that appear to be depicting the bodies of civilians lost with their hands were shocking to many and called for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the perpetrators.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in a radio interview on 4 April that there are signs that the Russian armies have committed "war crimes" in Buchi.
"What happened in Buchi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the Russian army could go so far as to make a genocide in Buchi.
"We will do everything we can to ensure that those who have committed these war crimes are not executed," said Sanchez in Madrid.
Speaking on public television late April 3, Russia’s U.S.A.S. spokesman Maria Zaharova rejected the charge as “provocation. ”
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after these materials appeared does not raise any doubt as to who "prescribed" this story," said Zaharova.
Earlier, the Russian Mino-Defend also had no evidence that the image of Buchi was "one more order of the Kyiv regime" and that all Russian armies had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on 4 April to discuss what it called the "provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Buchi.
On 4 April, Russia's next committee issued a statement declaring the "research" for the accusation of Ukraine's "known false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Buchi.
Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenski made a statement on 3 April accusing Russian troops of committing genocide in the city and told the Kremlin leaders that they should come to Buchi to see what their troops had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Zelenski said in a videocast, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's shared responsibility.
For these killings, for these tortures... for shooting at the police station," he said.
He claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian soldiers should be held responsible for the actions of the Ukrainian army.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and their heads down, I don't understand," he said about the scene of the victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, the city about 35 kilometers north-west of Kiev.
On April 2nd, a Ukrainian correspondent, Radio Freedom, visited the streets of the small city of the body, like civilians.
Only in one place did the correspondent see up to 10 bodies on the street.
The AP journalists saw bodies of at least 21 people in different places in Buchi.
The bodies of one group of nine people -- everyone in the civilian -- were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to locals, used Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed at a close distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities stated that the bodies of at least 410 peacemakers were found in the Kiev area, which was controlled by the Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, everything is, we bought everything on the list.
They said, "Keeva is gone."
Russian invasions in Ukraine are accompanied by horrific acts of robbery, rape, murder, torture.
This list contains another item that is now much less information — the removal of the local population into the enemy’s territory.
About mid-March, Russian occupations "equipped" Ukrainians from temporary occupied settlements into their territory and territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave under the Russian military polygon.
"Ukraine Truth" has been searching for exported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the evacuation itself is happening and whether there's any way to return to Ukraine after it.
It's a hero of this text that we've agreed to a voluntary evacuation outside of Ukraine under psychological pressure and without exit.
Fortunately, they live and maintain their relationship with their family.
However, given the Ukrainian authorities ’ claims, many were forced to flee to Russia and Belarus under severe pressure.
So in Melitopolis, the Russians stole the staff of the second sex home, drove out children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the late Ukrainian champion of Josip Začepinski.
The Aleksandra family, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter, Vali, moved to Hostmel in a few months to war.
Alexander just got a job at Antonov Airport, which is two and a half miles from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
Like the real plastics, Dennis and Marina collected some alarming bags in the past, but they didn't make it in the morning of February 24th.
They didn't have their car, and the Primina buses didn't take anyone anymore.
About 12 o'clock on February 24th, they saw the helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first rockets.
One of them entered a neighbor’s house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks until March 17th, until the Russian troops took them to Belarus.
About 40 people were hidden in their basement.
Not all of them made up their minds.
"On the 6th of February 24th, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian entered the train.
They say, "Who is there?" I say, "Go out."
They were looking for me, asking who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were asking if they were serving in the army.
They said to the women, "We have come to protect you by the command of Ramzan Kadriv."
It was a Czech OMON, not even an army, young boys aged 25-35.
They said, "We were helped by the Ukrainians in the war, Sasko Bili (commanded by the UN-UNSO Viking Nationalist Movement, which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Czech war - U.S.A.), we've now come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what was not enough for us.
We say the water was a big problem with her.
They broke down the store, took the goods from there under the heading "although the Russians take" and brought us six bottles.
There are still videos on the Internet where children thank Kadiro for his food.
That's how they brought the cowboy after they robbed the store and said, "We understand this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatović."
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give up our phones" -- they laughed.
Still, they kept separate from the Russians.
They said how good they came, because they didn't want the wars, the Ukrainians supported and generally good: "Putin is a breed, the Cadirs too, but we can't do anything, because there's our families."
And mostly they didn't fight, and they drove to rob shops, and they froze.
The Kuri were tied to each other, tied to one leg a Georgian tape, and to the other their white jump and called it a "police".
They arrived in Ukraine without any preparation.
I don't know how their investigation worked... when they were hit on Butch, so they didn't even take the murdered, they asked us, "What do you have, artillery?"
More than that, we were standing at the front door — the Czechs didn’t know each other, asking for passwords in the first days to find out what they were or what they were doing.
They were with us until March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, and behind them is the Hungarian decadent.
They put 30 to 40 units of technology between the houses, and ours got into it all the time.
But they came and told us the U.S.A. doesn't exist anymore, but there's "Azov," and according to them, "Azov" is like a thousand hundred in Ukraine.
I've been running "Keeve already gave up" since the beginning of March.
One day, a Russian - or a dissident - or FSB representative came to us and said that there would be evacuation.
And we listened to the radio -- there was about Bouchus, Hostomell, we thought maybe we had a green corridor.
From the very beginning, we passed our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We're saying we don't want to go there or there.
To what did they say, "It's a pity for the mentality of your children!"
As it worked out, they pushed us into the basement and started shooting us from under the house -- either by cities or by mines.
And then it flew back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
In our home there was a direct entry into the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer to the border and to the Red Cross.
The party didn't go, saying it was for the traitors of the country, saying, "You're shot there, they're gonna sell organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, both sides of the road were hot, broken, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians were taking the technique right out to them.
A lot of capponiers, buried techniques, and soldiers.
We went through an improvised checkpoint at the Belarus Chamber of Fame, many of whom were completely undocumented because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And this is where we hear the shooting!
Although the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, they fly, they fly, they turn on the border."
But we're from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were taken to the bus and taken to the Chunky sanatorium near Gomel.
His manager came, Wenger Vasil Stepanovic, saying, "Here I am, I am, I am with Montenegro.
But I understand Putin and Lucashenk won't stop until they get these thieves.
The poor people are suffering!
And we have Lucashenko so good!
He will say, "Yes, he will."
They offered to interview Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
"You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and UN representations (at least they were called) spread disinformation that men in Poland could not go.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents — the daughter had no foreign passport.
We had to get him on Monday, and on Thursday the war started.
There was nothing that helped us at the Ukrainian consulate, and in Minsk we were told that no one would take a bus without passports.
I'm going to say that the Belarusian volunteers were very helpful.
We were both settled in Minsk, and the escorts were carried out.
There was no force in the sanatorium.
Our second group of migration representatives said that you can enjoy the maximum week-and-a-half here, because Belarus is not Europe, there is no payment here.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Going by Mozira (about 50 km from the Ukrainian border — U.S.A.), we saw the launch of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the rocket first flies, it shines beautifully, and then it goes off.
People sitting on a bus in Mozira told me that the Russians were always shooting from the police station.
But I can say that the Belarusians don't want to fight at all.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break a son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is not believed at all.
They say, "You're missing, we're a peaceful people."
They don't understand that their poles are used to shoot Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting for us to be taken to Estonia.
Now we're going to register, decide what we're going to do.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now, of course, as much as Estonian."
Marina lived in the area of the military town of Hostomeli with her brother's family, his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On February 24th, she called the nobles and asked them to collect the most necessary items and documents.
In the evening, they went to the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself was unable to return home and, in principle, was unable to do so.
No one knew so much about evacuation.
Can't you go downtown on Monday?
Thank you. We've got everything. And we've always been waiting for you!
Thank you for the deal. The motels are nice.
And in this little apartment, there's no wolffighting, mostly for all your questions, and now I don't know how to be? And kids from Monday's online business, and there's no Internet.

On April 1, Butchi, head of the city, Anatolia Fedoruk, announced the glad news: On March 31, the Ukrainian military released the city from the Russian invaders.
The following day, the crew were expelled from the entire Kyiv area.
However, the joy that would be felt at that time by the Ukrainians was overshadowed by fear and hatred, for at the same time it was known that only the Russians shot at at least 280 peacekeepers.
They were just killed on the street, some tied their hands and shot in the armpit, some of the killed were minors.
The victims and victims of torture found the old village of Motijin Olgo Suhenko, her husband Igora, and Alexander’s son, stolen on March 23rd.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a brother’s grave, Igoria, in the sewerage.
A trail of 20 miles [20 km] from Kiev revealed the bodies of several women dressed in blankets.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go home, there's no one at home.
I ordered an ambulance from Germany with DHL.
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday, but no one contacted me and no mail was delivered, and the DHL site said that the receiver could not be found.
So the letter was sent to the post office and the address given to this department.
How can I take her?

Good morning, I've just been offered a job as a dentist in Prague, so thank you very much for your concern and I'm sorry.
It is very insignificant and somewhat irresponsible.
So I'm going to stop by, and I'm going to forget about the phone, or I'm not going to take the phone right now, and I'm not going to write that in school and that it's okay:)
And I'm worried about her because she's still not at home, but in another, not even a known state.
I hope I got the math right.
You didn't think I was still a kid.
And of course, the work is interesting.
But if I'm not physically smooth, because I don't have such a good physical shape.
I could pay for the apartment at a reasonable price if someone gave me the room.
You're communicating a lot, you'll probably know someone.
Good morning, work is so interesting, but we don't speak Czech.
What are some things we can do to keep track of?
The charitable organization Archipelago Caritas Olomouc wants to organize a project that will be interesting for Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, namely, in the city of Olomouc.
You imagine the Russians are raping women, their children are forced to observe it.
Then they can still rape, exacerbate the body, and that's what children see.
Good morning, I'm talking to you. I need to learn the Czech language, and I can't get rid of the news.
I'm very often with you thinking, and I think you hear my thoughts.
President Vladimir Zelenski stated that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners had come too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, published by the President's Office, writes "European Truth."
"All the equipment, all they're sending, for some sort of equipment it's done late.
So what if, for example, we talk about Mariupoli when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries I see 100 percent support, that's really right.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said Green.
As far as the question is concerned, it's got enough weapons in Ukraine to make a difference in war, the president said, "No, no."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not be, or it would look different.
"She would have opened up otherwise, we'd have close neighbors' shoulders, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be a war anyway," he added.
Remember, the Prime Minister of Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armour and anti-fraud weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and I go home.
write me about everything I need, please
I wanted to ask you maybe you know where we got the blender in the kitchen.
Destructive acts in the form of faeces and disinformation are designed to provoke panic and disorganization that are sensitive to public security.
I'm from Ukraine, now I'm in Plzny.
Before the war in Ukraine, for 20 years I worked as a designer of women and children’s clothes from various materials, and I could also cut on special equipment and do the WTO.

When most companies don't work.
When there's nowhere to earn.

And tomorrow we'll go again... because the food we've been given is enough for a while.
Do you want to provide for yourself... and children where?
How can you live without knowing the language?

He asked me to just talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man, and he thought I might be his toy and I might need his money.
And then he made me a proposal.

What happened there at the man's stop that the police came and quickly arrived?
Diana didn't answer me or you.
All right, I just need to print out the drawings for the kids, so it'll be fine.
But you may need more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I'm worried you're satisfied with my job.
In this case, I know a girl who's Ukrainian, but she's studying in the Czech Republic, especially tourism.
You really don't want to come here for a minute with your kids and your grandma.
I want you to be with me.
In general, breathing is difficult in a foreign country, with more and more being desired at home every day.
Mrs. Agatha, if you need this photo, I'll take a photo.
Thank you for trying to give us a better life here.
I remember you all my life.
And I'm going to remember and smile. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

"I tell her that "television repair and radio receiver" has been pulled through import details, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to touch the outside when they call."
"We've been hiding information about war from the mother-in-law for a whole month.
As long as it's done.
However, in the Flemish (U.P.) on the pus and on the back of the paws, it could be stress, changes in diet, and vitamin deficiency.
The last two reasons have been removed, and this stress is not dependent on me, unfortunately.
The flame, unlike the maggot, doesn't sound, hears both the sirens and the explosions."
Thanks to Olga's bad hearing and most of the time she spends in her room, her bride month lived in her apartment with her "incognito."
And on April 1, 93, Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"33 days as a partisan, I lived with her in the apartment.
She was also hiding from the war, and what I was next to was as formal as always for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her a reception -- she listened for 4 hours, and then she sang for 2 hours."
The receiver was always at bedtime.
Most of the time the mother - in - law spends in her room.
I felt bad about it, and it allowed me to be undetectable to her.
If I heard the sound of her walkers, I would hide in my room.
First, she hid the receiver and the TV from her.
And then she called everyone who was in contact with her, 6-7 people.
She asked her to talk to her about anything but war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the very beginning and to the end
It's April 17th -- I've got a 2 apartment cleaning :)

A British man who defended Mariupoli in U.S. lions says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
A British military officer of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who took part in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they were putting up a weapon and going into captivity to the Russian occupations.
Source: twitter-history of Adyna Eislin, British who served in the U.S.A.L.L.L.L.L., 2018, with reference to family members and friends of Aeslin, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Aeslin who spoke to him
It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Mariupoli, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian army.
We did not have any food or ammunition left.
Thank you, everyone. I hope the war will be over soon."
Details: Eslin served in the 36th separate U.S. Marine Foot Brigade, which took part in Mariupola's defence operation.
The U.S. journalists contacted the mother of military officer Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had informed her on the phone that they were planning to go into captivity.
Another military friend, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in his last phone conversation, Eislin told of plans for their division of capital.
According to him, the brigades ended up fighting and food.
Atlas News reporters contacted his friend, who said that the Eslina sub-division is about to surrender to the Russian sub-divisions so as not to get into the hands of the so-called "cadrons."
There was also an audio recording of a telephone conversation in which Esslyn spoke to his well - known American friend who was planning to go to Ukraine.
Asslin said they were trying to get out of town in civilian clothing, but they failed.
The British once said that he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner in Instagram.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to take part in the fight against terrorists called the Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the U.S.A.L.L.A. and made an oath.
Eislin's friends and close friends were named Johnny, and in the constellations he's more known under the nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I would also like to know whether we're together or not.

One brother at the war in Mariupoli, another in Zaporizia, and today a man from Kiev were transferred to Harków.
They call every day saying it's all right, and there's someone who knows it, they won't always tell the truth.
She wanted to come to you, but she wanted to handle some things.
I ask my husband in the morning if he'll make it tomorrow.
When you come home, please write to me, I need to talk to Daniel.
Major attackers for their losses in the fight played full.
He was shot by a teacher named Dmitr Pavlicko, his unknown relative, young Boris Olexian.
Their bodies were thrown into “a deep washbasin that the earth was covered with dust. ”
“ There was a dead man standing in the city. ”
Often, one of the residents ran from house to house.
On the streets, there were always corpses slaughtered by wolves
Maybe I'll follow you, and I need you.

I want to be able to say thank you to everyone who helped us because that was the last hope, right?
I'm not afraid of work, just as I lived in the village, so I can and I like to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
You have a very interesting tradition, we're going to Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved Bill 7176, which has the name "The damage of monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the field of economics."
Amazingly, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the area of economics was... the place where the members of the board of supervisors and the state banks are sitting.
Initiators of the bill believe that making decisions by the board of supervisors in the state of Kiev can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine’s national security.
We are aware of a large number of new risks to the holding company, but we are not aware of any company that needs to be physically present at the location.
The potential danger from such a law is a great basis for "relevant" all acquisitions in the difficult reform of the entrepreneurship after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory councils, and then establishing manual management.
Which was until 2015.
Why do companies have oversight boards, and who should join them?
More than that, if under patriotic slogans one harmful bill will "fly", others can fly tomorrow, for example, you can take out the state procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NGOs.
There's a lot to write for war.
By the way, this initiative came before the war and Bill 7176.
So on February 22, this rule was added to a comparative table of Bill 5397.
In general, the desire to discredit the supervisory board in some way has been circulating among some national electors for a long time.
Not for criticism, but to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will consider the arguments that explained the need for it to be adopted.
And then we'll make our proposals on how to deal with the issue of managing hostages during the war.
The first deputy minister of economics, Dennis Kudin, explained the need for such innovation to risk losing the Internet and other means of communication that would prevent the remote operation of supervisory councils.
In other words, the risk is that the Supervisory Board cannot make the necessary decisions in relation to what could be paralyzed the company's work.
We agree that such a risk exists, but can it prevent him from moving overseers to Ukraine?
Let us imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory board (most of them) put their personal safety above the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In such a case, they may be released according to the bill.
And then, more quickly, it will lead to the loss of the quorum needed by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it is not possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the Supervisory Board, since the law provides for a competitive selection that takes on an average of 3-4 months.
Hence, the decision proposed by Bill 7176 could not save the decision - making by the board of supervisors from losing the opportunity to make it, and it would rather lead to it!
National MP, the author of Dmitro Nataluh's bill gives other arguments to support it.
In particular, he notes: "Many companies, such as the Defence and Industrial Complex (PPC), now need relocations" and therefore, "it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna to Zoom."
For the first time, there are virtually no OPC companies in Ukraine with supervisory advice.
The supervisory board is a failure in the "Ucrombrück," which is essentially managed by almost all OPC companies.
But even in "Ucromovprom," according to legislation, the supervisory board has a fairly limited mandate, and all its members are performing duties on a non-free basis.
The entire power of the Ukrobromi belongs to the Director-General, who will decide on the need for a relocation of an OPC that is part of the group.
Moreover, such an argument does not support criticism even because Bill 7176 does not at all change the legislation governing the operation of OPC companies.
Mr. Dmitro on his Facebook page also cites the arguments that can be referred to the category of "emotionals".
Such arguments usually have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of companies and companies, but let's try to figure out some of them: "respective foreign experts in the very first word "war" are leaving Ukraine in 2021, but in 2021 they remain members of the supervisory board in Ukraine's state companies with a full salary of several hundred thousand fines, while Ukraine itself is actually suffering from the war."
First of all, this manipulation -- most of these members of the Supervisory Boards have never lived in Ukraine and have only come here periodically.
So to say that they're leaving Ukraine, in a soft, unfair way.
Secondly, because of the kroner's pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory board have long been involved in online meetings.
This tool has long been widely used in world practice, and it is widely used in a wide range of fields: business, education, medicine, and so forth.
It should also be remembered that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, these people have a different kind of job, and it's just electronic communications that helps them do that.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitro not make identical claims to members of the Supervisory Boards who are Ukrainians?
Because they too are not at the place where their companies are located.
In fact, this is not the first popular attempt to get foreigners out of the supervisory board, and the war is just a new convenient opportunity.

In Bravarsk, Upper Town, and Buchansk areas of the Kyiv region, which were freed from occupations, a stronger command hour will be introduced for 2 years.
Paul’s Direct Language: “In the occupied areas of the Brivavar, the Upper Town and the Buchanan Districts, which were under Russian occupation and were released by the Ukrainian defence forces, the commandant hour has been increased!
In the territory of these cities and the border forces will operate from 21:00 on 2 April to 06:00 on 5 April."
Details: According to the head of the bulwark, it is now categorically forbidden to live on the streets of inhabited areas and in other public places, to move in transportation and to walk.
People can only go out on the street when they are alarmed to go into hiding.
Such restrictions are introduced to remove the effects of Russian aggression — cleaning and exchanging territories.
Omeljanuk called on people who had left these areas to stay away from returning home.
In the rest of Kiev, the ordering hour will last from 21:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

The Lucaschenka regime was held for three years, 27 and 28 years, with the aim of destroying the two railway stations under the Osipii, which ensures the movement of railways.
Source: Radio Freeboda, Vashna Human Rights Centre, Head of the M.V.S.S. Crime Police Gennadiay Kazakevic, quoted by the Belta State Information Agency
In the U.S.S.B., Belarus reported that on the night of March 30th, three Bobruysk residents were detained, one injured.
According to Springs, men in detention were actively opposed and tried to escape.
The security forces were using weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and found in a medical facility.
Another was given medical help.
The head of the I.V.S. criminal police, Belarus, said that "terrorist acts on the RB's railway will be severely stopped" by gun-powered force.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police had another co-worker of the Belarusian Railway, the co-worker of the Baranovic Division "BZD" and the manager of the BZD's thematic resources in "WContacts and "Unclassics" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and where he is unknown, he reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March in Belarus, at least 40 railways were held for entertainment.
Remember: The formation of BYPOL, declared by the Lucaschenka regime extreme, continues to call on Belarus to diversify the railway transport and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the "Permamaga" plan.
The Belarusian "Rake Partisans" are thus trying to resist the Russian aggression against Ukraine.
It is known that by means of Belarus, the F.F. has stopped fighting in Ukraine.

US ban investment in RF and sanctions against Putin's daughter
The United States, together with G7 and the EU, imposes new sanctions on the daughters of President Putin, the largest banks of the Alpha Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is reported on the White House website.
Bjerbank is Russia's largest financial institution owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets relating to the U.S. financial system and ban U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a full ban on new investments in RF.
To this end, U.S. President Joe Byden will sign a new decree, which includes a ban on new investment in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on an approved over 600 transnational companies' decision to leave Russia.
The output of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as legal and consulting companies," the White House said.
The third step of new US sanctions has become a restriction against large Russian state enterprises in the critical area.
This will prevent U.S. citizens from operating with these organizations and will freeze any assets they have in the jurisdiction of the States.
Minfin's detailed list will be published for the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the full blocking of the assets of the adult children Putin, the wives and daughters of the Foreign Minister of Labour, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mistin
The sanctions take them off the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

My girls can't go anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you to let me know if you could hear the information.
I'd love to rent a place with a good girl.
If you can know that, let me know.
On my side, I won't.
Thank you very soon.
You didn't write another person named Natal for 54 years. Please enter the exact address and the cost of courses.
I think it's better for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I didn't change my name, it's one of my births:)
I'm sorry I didn't see you.
We're going to the Medicom right now.
I mean, Ani should be working this hour the other day.
What day would it be better for her to come early?
I hear tomorrow, the Internet is working bad.
You're lucky you're gonna do it.
Thank you .. we found something from things, but there was nothing from technology...
Both beginners, except the abbots, we don't know anything.
Nothing's going on.
Maybe on Monday 25.04?
You can take the kids with you, the toy here is enough :)
I was wondering about Dad.
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'm thinking of something with this money.
We'll do it somehow.
But when it's paid, please, no credit.
Write me straight, and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Should you take the clothes they gave you?
It's not my day. The cones broke in the living room. One morning.
Something's happened to you. I don't see what.
I'm very sad too.
I'll remind you of the invoice later.
Do you only have a father who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to clean the house, and how many houses have windows?
I'm ashamed I'm distracting you from your business.
Good evening, I can't share with you.
I suggest I read Joe Dispens, he's doing scientific research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons.
The TV journalist "1+1" Natalia Nagorna published the morning of April 12th video that she was handed over to the 36th Marine Foot Brigade from Mariupol.
There the soldiers say they have no weapons left to take part in the battle, and the mountains of the wounded.
They said, "The bill goes for an hour."
Prior to that, on 11 April, a separate seabed Brigade, which took part in the defence of Mariupol, published a address to Ukrainians in Russian.
It was reported that on 11 April it could be the last fight for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command was not connected to the fighters for two weeks.
Skeptics were said to have published the application in Russian.
The Chief Commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Valerius Prisoner assured us that the link to the Defence Forces in Mariupoli is, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian warriors in the area of the establishment "Azostal" in Mariupoli and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of 11 April, Russian captors dropped on Mariupoli the toxic substance of unknown origin.
According to leaders of Asza, Andrey Billetsky, the RF's army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which holds out the combatants of the Azaws.
Thank you, I'm going to check in with you.
The situation is the same while we're here.
( 2 hours driving)) Walks, moms in shops and back!)
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she'd do here.
The Czech drone squadron began to fly over Ukraine from today.
Nearly 50 professional copyists will serve to detect and separate them to direct destruction of the enemy predator.
Two Zacarpathian and two Czech “birds ” were sent to Ukraine in the evening due to the deputy of the Mukacherev city of Volodimir Labutenko.
Today, their interns led by the head of the local council and the coordinator of https://www.facebook.com/examplethere101/ Vasil Stour delivered drones for the purpose: they were given special divisions of Ukrainian armies in various cities where fighting is currently taking place.
In order to make the most effective and safe use of copters, their locations will now remain in secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, say that in the near future many more interesting “gifts” will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupation and preserve the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I love sweet, but I can do it without it.
I'm worried we're not gonna make it.
Coming back to Ukraine soon, continuing to work
If it's okay, I'll agree.
I'll try myself, but if there's a problem, I'll write you if I can?
The Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally in the old lady's village in Jehu's village, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no one
Perhaps she will be disappointed and will rise in her heart
My phone was repaired today.
And I think I'm still on the street.
She drank drugs and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry too, but I'd better meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, I want you to throw down the music you like.
I'm curious about your musical abilities.
Mom and Dad Should Be Obedient
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's wheel.
It was colder and raining here today.
But it's no harm to destroyed houses, to the harm of the people who are being abused by the tenants.
In Herson, the occupationers were recognized by the Slava Ukraine Memorial in Herson on Prekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that the unknowns broke the flag of the European Union, smashed the panels with photographs of the sky hundreds and killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupying forces destroyed the portraits of the heroes of the hundreds of Heavens and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian War.
We've got a flag.
Good morning, thanks to the kids for the Christmas party, we don't have that habit so we didn't know if the kids were just giving them chocolate and cake, maybe something else had to be given.
In Czech, there's someone to talk to, if that's the case.
Because I'm living a guy in a group where twelve people are gonna be here, and then they're gonna go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
He was already in his arms today.
Even today, he's been sleeping there.
That's why we've made great progress.
I'm going to have to bring the cowards back!
Today I don't have the strength to do it.
Since I have been pushing away from the days and times of cleaning after guests, I can say about April a month because I already have an approximate cleaning schedule.
In May, I can say about the end of April or at the beginning of May.
She just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hey, I'm sorry she didn't write a long note and cook dinner and get some sleep.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or we'll see you after your arrival)
He's modest, he's been learning a lot lately, knowing he really needs it in his life.
Hey, it's been a very good time.
I was a little shocked to work with people on such a high position.
Today, you have a lesson with a lady who is the head of the Economics Department of the Highlands.
She was very pleased with my work.
The wrong thing was right in his ass.
On Monday, I have to get confirmation of my work as well as a cash payment for the ass.
I'm starting to feel like Friday.
I don't do anything but a lot of them and I sleep. (and I drink a lot of water.)
If I go to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you if I can.
I need another analysis.
You don't have to go again.
It's a very bad thing to do, it's a bad thing to do, it's a bad thing to do.
That's enough.
Can you send me the right email?
I would like to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you have written to.
And are children being fed there or should they be brought with them?
And now for a moment you can go in there's one question
If You Need Help, Write
If I'm not wrong, you're celebrating the Passover today, right?
At first, we didn't really want you to make money so people wouldn't think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling, I didn't have enough two points:
I'll be able to rest. Getting power and energy. Thank you for today's gift.
I'm going to look at the video right now, it's going to be good because the whole family is going to be drawing.
The University of Karasin calls on workers and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, hearings and gossip.
Focus only on official information.
That's how you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who's staying in Ukraine also helps the army
I've collected a few pieces for the portfolio.
After the festival, you have to have the internet.
I'd like to be your spare designer.
How I get the day I wasn't at work is a pass
Staff configuration: Russia prepares a provocation in the Prednistros to blame Ukraine
The Russian army can face provocations in the Prednistrov region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighbouring state".
In effect, "The Russian Federation's armed forces are not excluded from provocative actions in the territory of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state."
Details: The opponent continues to build an additional army for operations on the loose.
In the near future, it is likely that the crew will try to reinvigorate.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personal supplies, weapons, and techniques to engage in combat activities in Ukraine.
We're preparing weapons and military technology at the 60th permanent site of the Special Motor Shot Brigade (Monaster) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that this weapon will be moved to the temporary occupied territory of the Donetsk area.
Also, to restore the special composition of the Battalion Tactical Group's divisions from the 36th individual Motor Shot Brigade (Borza, Zabaykalsky) of the 29 General Army of the Eastern Military District, a set of military officers from the designated Brigade is being carried out.
The particular problem of the enemy is that the drivers and drivers' mechanics are being built up.
The event of the selected special component from the permanent site is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Probably the opponent to disrupt the supply of cargo to the place where the fighting takes place will continue to hit the transport infrastructure in the territory of Ukraine with the aim of destroying them or getting them out of the way.
Defined divisions of the Republic of Belarus armed forces continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Bilorussian border in the Brestian and Gomelian areas.
On the freeway, separate divisions of the 6th General Army and the coastal armies of the North Fleet continue partial blockade of the city of Harkow, and the artillery raids of individual areas of the city continue.
An air exploration of the area is taking place in the direction of the Ishumus to identify the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
For this, the opponent uses the BPLA Orlan-10.
With the forces of two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to make a raid on the inhabited areas of Dhungenke and Dmitrovka, and he failed and went to previous positions.
On the Donetsk side, the opponent continues to focus on the people under the control of the safe, ruby, low, and Novobakhmutuk and the establishment of full control over Mariupoli.
The enemy tried to take a storm in the Golden District, and he was unsuccessful.
In Mariupoli, by means of artillery and aircraft, the occupants continue to engage in storm operations in the areas of the Azostal and the seaport.
By means of separate divisions, the enemy carried out artillery shootings of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the inhabited highlands, Trudolovevka and Marianska.
In the areas of Donetsk and Lugansk, Ukraine's defenders in the past century have been defeated by four enemy attacks, five tanks destroyed, eight armed units, six vehicles and eight artillery systems.
Didn't you understand your thoughts?
Of course we're trying to make it, but I doubt it.
And you can sleep like you want, and I'll hold you back.
Are you sure you don't mind if I come?
Maybe you just don't want to see today, so tell me, I'll understand everything.
Thank you. We didn't watch TV at home, but we don't need to set up :)
I'm going to turn on the TV just to listen to the Czech language.
I've finished my monthly tariff package today:)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy fabric for lift, rope, rope for lift
I understand, so I can prepare material in this area.
I'm asking her, I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she's giving us so much pies.
I'll see my father later.
I've read a Facebook post, and I think Google might have written something about it.
Good day, we brought the things you brought, but are there things we can bring you in 10 minutes?
I thought about the reason for the job.
If Mr. Director arranges, I can start working from next week because tomorrow morning I plan to go to the office to submit documents (if possible, because very large queues) and on Saturday rain :)
I'm looking for a brigade at the beginning, I love chemistry at school, I'm learning the Czech language to know perfectly, I dream of working on You
Friends of old, and not very much, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends by spirit and mind.
Now there are times of distress that have come upon you.
During the last month, I've been communicating with a lot of you.
Your life, which has never been easy without it, has become like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have been admitted to feeling guilt and shame because of your country’s actions toward your neighbors.
Because of their submission to Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you, activists, have been in danger for a long time, and you have been preparing for the final blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very long friend from the Memorial.
Let's talk a little bit later — as usual, Sasha answered greedily.
Others — artists, critics, writers — are impressed by the sudden collapse of your little world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be open: except for the very few of you -- those who worked in the Memorial, in the New Newspaper, in the Echo of Moscow, in the Medusa, in the Nauali organization and in a number of other places -- did many of you do anything to oppose this regime?
Unless they were involved in the meetings when they were still taking place.
Also read the column of the Russian journalist "True to hide, be quiet"
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your lasting indifference to what is happening around you, by your apathy and by your passive participation, which may now have been a great burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like that.
In 1990 there was a short period when you had to some extent freedom and democracy -- a loose even curve, but a real one.
But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you are finally so afraid of grief that you are looking for salvation behind the back of the king, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
As many people as he didn't kill, you still think he was safer.
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of grabbing and distributing the CDB archives, as did the Germans from the train station, you took the soul to the Dzerjinsk Memorial – and allowed the CDB to lie on the ground, upgrade, transform and take power over the country.
When you were put before a choice between stealing the country and returning the Communists, you did not begin to fight for the possibility of a third option — and humbly agreed with the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and this marked the end of mass meetings for great social justice or against war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
And then Putin showed up, young, entrepreneurship, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you have bought it, but you have voted for it anyway, or you have preferred not to vote at all.
When he started rebalancing Chechnya with the earth, most of you were blindfolded.
I remember those years well.
I was then working in Chechnya, helping those affected by the travel "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my eyes the ruins of the Grozno, Qatar Yurta, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of peaceful people, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Bred, we're sick of your Chechen." I remember those words very well.
In response I was indignant, "Friends, it's not my Chechen, it's your Chechen.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid stranger here.
It's your power to bomb one of your cities, kill your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came an economic rise in the middle of zeros, accompanied by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the money stolen is left in middle class pockets.
Many of you have become well - off, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have acquired a new home and found a better job.
The prices have grown, and isn't that a disaster?
Moscow was celebrating and licking her throat.
When several opposers — Juria Szkočihina, Anna Politkovska, Alexander Lithuania, and others — were killed — many of you were shocked and expressed fears about what had happened.
However, the matter did not continue.
When, after two terms, Putin transferred President Medveyev's post and himself took the prime minister's seat, you, as I can see, barely paid attention to that.
When a few months later, the Soviet Union invaded Georgia, most of you were either ignored or silent.
How many of you have I met in the next few years on the mountain slopes of Goodauri, in the suburbs of Kazbegi or in the cafes and in the Turkish spas of Tbilisi while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that there's hardly much we've done in the West if we've done anything at all.
A bit of resentment, a little bit of sanctions; but what is the significance of Russia's more critical violation of international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the internal market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important thing.
However, by the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, were still waking up.
When Putin again replaced the seats with Medvey and planted the president's chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you came out in mass protests.
The name of Avail became negative, you didn't leave the street for half a year, and the regime finally felt terrible that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
At first, alternative actions were organized, more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled.
Thousands have been found behind bars.
Some were given huge terms.
"And what could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"It's so strong and we're so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look what they did two years ago.
Enraged by the proselyte president, who deceived their European hopes, they once captured the Majdan — and never left him.
They built the tent on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy him, they began to defend themselves by means of clubs, armor, and molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protestors turned to attack.
Many have died, but they have won.
The fugitive became Janukovich, and the Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose leaders themselves and expel them if they did not do their business.
Meiden didn't like Putin very much.
That was a bad example.
That's why, using a common sense, he captured Crimea.
Some of you were opposed, yet there was little benefit.
And how many of you have been impressed!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
From where a new myth was born, many of you who despised Putin and his jokes suddenly returned to 180 degrees and began to worship him.
I find it hard to find a reason because immediately after that, we stopped talking.
The rest of those who remained with my friends were mostly silent.
"We don't care about politics," you said.
And you hid new in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, just like new after the restoration that Moscow started in 2012, with their binbega, a common wifi and hipster coffee.
Indeed, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it only gets better.
You've just noticed Syria.
There were terrorists there, right?
IDIL or whatever... even a Moscow editor who released my book on Syria then criticized it in an interview because I didn't understand anything about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I drove there and I saw myself on the streets of Homs' state snipers shooting cold blood at my children's peers.
Of all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers who started to bomb thousands of peacekeepers in 2015 gained experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Nimeller:
"At first they came after the socialists, but I spoke -- because I'm not a socialist.
Then they went to the trade union members, but I spoke because I was not a trade union member.
Then they came to the Jews, but I spoke, because I am not a Jew.
Then they came after me, but there was no one left who could say anything to my defense."
How many of you have talked about Czechs, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority spoke.
Some actually speak now — such as Dmitro Glukhovski, Michaelo Shiskin, Michaelo Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, such as Marina Ovannikov, risking entering a new GULAG or establishing a Naualma company.
As for others, you know best where you live.
So, I'm sure you understand: when Putin deals with Ukrainians -- or if he doesn't make it, he'll marry you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who are courageous, but mostly alone, have come out of protest and have yet to take place a small term, but soon they will get more serious.
For a thousand of you, who signed the petition, who made a disagreement in the constellations (even with no black square in Instagram) or spoke in private talks with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of free will were given simply for the anecdotes were not so far away from the past — and now they are very likely waiting for you in the future.
Who will then speak for you?
The example of Ukrainians – even more than 2014 – fears the travel regime: they argue that they can fight it.
And that mind, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive it may be on his advantage paper.
Considering all of this, few people in Russia realize this as well as what is going on in the war.
But you, my friends, know what's happening right now.
You're reading foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you're connected.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence is over.
Your choices are just hohma, your laws, if you don't take into account the repressive ones, they don't cost more than the paper they wrote, your last free media is gone, your economy is ruined faster than I write, you don't have any credit cards to buy tickets abroad, even if there's still some leftovers.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will require your agreement, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try or go somewhere, or they'll let you down.
I doubt you'll see another option.
And yet another one is left.
What's the end of this regime that's going to break?
And you may need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not start with you: because of the economic collapse that lies in Russia, it will most likely burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices fly and wages are not paid, the people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes out at meetings itself, as it has been, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be required. The crowd will need to be converted to mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool -- the internet that can limit the mode, but which is still working and which can be adjusted in almost any circumstances.
The Avail organization has been collapsed, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized.
You're too many, you're millions.
The Moscow police can deal with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If there's more than 300 thousand, it's going to be shocked.
An army will have to be used, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to dealing?
After all, what did he force them to do in Ukraine, all of which he made them pass through?
Of course, danger will be very high.
Many of you will understand the fear that is set before you, but the fear of the true God is the fear of the true God.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be scared if I were you.
For example, in the case of Syria, and now in Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what is happening to those who are forced to neglect their masters who are forced not only to demand freedom but are really trying to obtain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat -- and be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet -- and be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes -- and he will die in the gray room under police deeps.
This has been happening for many years now, and it will only continue to be strengthened by increasing and expanding.
So you don't have a choice, if you don't do anything, you know what it's going to end.
Be cool, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were on Friday at work, we were told that we could come on Monday.
We'll be home at night.
What Do You Think of Me as a Secretary of State?
How often do you go to a expensive restaurant?
Once a Wednesday I go to dinner at a expensive restaurant
( For fully formatted text, see publication)
So we liked it very well and we wanted something brighter, so it's a better option.
I was in a room where there were many people, tired of energy.
I'm feeling sick, coughing, fever, voice loss, weakness, and dizziness.
I have to go to that government for work.
We've already done this, but we said who registered in April received the money only at the end of the month.
We need a pass on Thursday, we go to the doctor with the kids.
But at night I wrote a lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her and I'm going to have to report.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, and I spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental work that I was completely disappointed in.
It's a waste of time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I’m communicable, but I’m also serious about marriage.
There was one man for whom I had to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I believe that in order to create a family, people must love, respect, trust each other.
Right now, I haven't met.
Good day. Where in the Head can you get forms to rip out the paste (paper or silicone)?
All right, thanks for the advice, then I'm going to file a witness poll on Valu.
She has a DCP in a lying state, she now has a little broken in a plaster, a wheelchair in a lying position, eating all over in a blender
Mr. Reihard, I'm sorry to bother you at some point.
But I have an important question for you.
I went into the playroom with Natalie today to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the child away because she said that she had come to see things and had them in that room with the clothes and Mr. Valerie had opened our baby room up to 7:00 last night.
Can that really be true?
It's time to go to the room by 4:00.
And finally, it's our responsibility.
But I don't have a load. I don't have a very weak Internet page.
Good day, we've got it all right.
The most difficult to understand is the challenge of geometry.
On Saturday, Vladimir helped us.
Age studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We Are Thankful for Living
Yeah, but I thought you weren't full.
We're going to try to collect the sum as much as possible by the end of the week to figure out
Situation on Russian Intrusion – Briefing of the Director of the Office of President Alexia Arestović (10.04.2022)
The director of the President's Office told of the heroic act of an officer of the Armed Forces in Mariupoli -- he was surrounded and wounded, so he broke himself with the radio station so that she wouldn't get to the opponent.
I have a very important question to ask if they'll help me get my granddaughter to count for her for 5 years (bronchial asthma) now in her womb and flu...
We need a family doctor to understand a little Ukrainian or Russian.
The doctor’s advice is urgent, and we are very concerned about her condition.
We live in the Czech Republic Lower Chabry. We need a doctor who's here in Lower Chabry or somewhere near possible Brno but not far from the subway so we can get there.
Butterflies were very popular.
Butterflys sat on their hands and feet.
How's your day?
Oh, my God, I'm so grateful, I'm not saying thank you very much.
Mom's been there since 4 a.m.
Perhaps the householder will leave his cell phone for communication.
So far, I think it's the best option for this building in Prague-8.
The director told me nothing about the possibility of a sponsorship fee for the children’s lunches.
I've been given such data to pay.
By March and April, I had already paid for food.
If you could help me pay for May and June?
What do I have to do?
You want to ask the principal of the school about this?
Would you like to go out on Mondays or come in the middle?
All your friends will know that you're communicating with me.
I don't know what I need to do. I don't know what I need to do.
Were you the first to get out of a relationship or left behind?

I was a manicure master, and a friend of the manager.
But we can do everything, we can do Ukraine, and what we don't do, we can learn quickly))
I want you to find a good assistant.
I thought something like this was Monday.
Can I ask you to take them myself, how are you going to go home?
