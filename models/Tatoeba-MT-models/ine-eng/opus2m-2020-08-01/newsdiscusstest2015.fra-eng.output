The remaining UKIPs who refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to make health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First, you use specific arguments, then discredit them with a strictly veiled homophobia.
Every time my family and I need NHS, we have to make a tail in the back of chronic hypocondria intolerants who think they're all due.
I think you're the one who's using specific arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wings, does not exist virtually.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel UKIP universe that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote drawn from a torch is not evidence.
Yeah, so get on the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, he only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for promoting such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity anymore, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by charges of homophobia.
The Farage phrase is very surprising, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He didn't even make any homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to make it back to you.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
It is so rare that unlike Farage and his united disciples of Thatcher, who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexity of humanity is something of good, then not.
Finally, the situation is as bad in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis coming the period of austerity, nothing will have been settled.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland, the 'Third of Europe' we boasted, a few years ago.
We met next!
That starts reading the article again.
Ireland is being tried to believe that it is a true country and that a '' NEW MIRACLE ECONOMIC''' is taking place.
With the Brussels agreement, taxation on the lowest companies in Europe, a three-fold shift in work, an ongoing migration.
With these ingredients no ''pavoir'' for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 1980s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal Considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development has not been a long calm river, it is in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rates in Europe?
That's wrong!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on businesses.
Now there is real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If a report is believed to come out in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full power.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge, and there are new (and expensive) cars with all corners of the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the resumption is evident in the daily pockets since the return.
Is it supposed to be of economic actuality?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon burn.
In another article that they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hanging on the A140.
Is Ryanair now planning to transfer passengers from one flight to the other in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so a few bags and scratches on the elders will soon be forgotten.
That says I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once refistolled.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay passengers a supplement for the additional fear that we wanted to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give each other a good heart.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay other than the basic tariff have only to take it on themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs resulting from this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an airport air traffic controller error.
Passengers were boarded on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes English ISIS to Syria, not as you say.
Good Travel
Last Sunday in Paris, Frances-Bourgeois Street: the Marais is mostly pedestrian, and literally grows from the world.
People do not come in mass for the quality of restaurants (anywhere, for the most part) nor for the Review Room at the White Mental Space (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that stores are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly alive and animated.
With a lot of foreigners who spend..
Do you think Sunday's opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, drunk from the world with 50% of tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that I found acceptable is that of areas receiving an important number of foreign tourists and it is because they buy in detachment.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of business for the same reasons each year .
The rest of the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows prices to be reduced.
The Sunday rest is a right for employees, except for exceptions.
That is why it is provided and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister responsible for the economy, nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs, have the least competence to reform the labour code.
While they're bluffing it.
What's the law for?
Satisfied part of the population and businesses that want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday, I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my City of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's inheritance was, against his will, used to pay the inheritance fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
No doubt his legacy would want his share of the cake, if you pass my expression.
its preference for a victory of nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
I don't know.
But for 5 years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 He took the lead in other government aristocrats who wanted to discuss a "agreement" with the Nazis and he was very well-dressed.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France and Belgium and, finally, the whole world can thank God for having had these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no one else.
Churchill's size has nothing to do with this discussion.
If his descendants sold their paintings on the free market to raise the money for inheritance costs, they could even benefit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they collect money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was "the time of truth", Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A resumption of the internal market by public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, infrastructure yards being by definition less renewable.
With regard to the social reforms proposed by the Minister, they well reflect the true misconception of the French: their lack of confidence in dialogue
Return to prince values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Whether we come to his aid or he has the right to exchange services which he or she has made or has made to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer with the smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the dancer who lives on income from his property.
There is a difference between the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives on his pension.
A good to rent or two for a couple upstairs, it's vice versa.
The little genius of the Finance lacks particular imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of shortage in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so in nothing a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of degression emerges in response to a recession which is only a brutal wild degression
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less difficult, then the need for investments is creating: isolation, renewal of the railway network, urban transport, transport and storage of energy etc.
A taxation that promotes high incomes and incomes.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopingo.
The benefits of Samsung are undermined by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 More may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's sake.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft put in place this philosophy, we met a decade of stagnation that was finally interrupted by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by one manufacturer because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach any value to the design, for them the options, functionality and price.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform".
Is there "a better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing portable industry with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's healthier and needs to be encouraged.
That's what's of our interest to everyone.
I'm glad you found exactly what you're looking for and that's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, well on Parisian bobos) could tell us which author(s) they fight ideas on the genre and tell us what works they are hearing right from fighting.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is it Judith Butler or Eric Zemmmour?
Well, Jean, I love you very much, and you're someone of intelligence and culture.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato, referring to Holopherna, near which I had not come (I did not have her spirit vitality).
Otherwise, in the "fund", since you're going back there, this subject doesn't interest me, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I'm slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: admit that, culturally, refer Judith to Holoferen, that's what it is.
Who's afraid to ask the world?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ give us answers.
The first, invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second, qualifying Judith Butler as a very symbolic gorilla.
We can see how close these studies are to their home.
Obviously, we are no longer in the debate.
It's another thing, much deeper.
@ Have you read,Jean,that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Pretend to fight ideas from the only exhibition that their detractors do ( Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very strict.
But well, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it's all the difference between having a clear opinion and having a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic gorilla, I was pleased with the "Second Sex" (it was more than my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I looked at the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat offset the disappointment that sometimes the sight was blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really include the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash moon of blood.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will make it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with that, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne then of course I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover over the whole week of the rain of the Persians and for virtually all major astronomical phenomena in recent years.
I'm starting to think that there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to keep the people of Melbourne from seeing what it is from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are much better on the other side of the Cordillare.
There were periods between 10 and 20 minutes where I couldn't see the eclipse because of the clouds above the Melbourne bay.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
QUICONQUE looks at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will occupy you when it ends (forcely) by disappearing?
It seems you spent a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people are criticizing the Abbott government and then accusing EUX of being obsessed.
Great photo of the moon above the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It would be said that Mars is going into conflict with Earth!
Nothing on stock exchange and real estate speculation.
Nothing on inequality between labour and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not provided.
No hypertext link to the original documents for an opinion.
Let's see today on Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miraculous revenues: in Spain, exports have been lowest for five years.
Greece's stock market is falling apart.
Yet these were examples to be followed.
The reform of the notaries would generate a claim for compensation of EUR 8 billion.
The Department of Economics claims that these claims for compensation are not substantiated.
What if the Ministry of the Economy makes a mistake?
Will decision-makers who have taken advantage of the courageous attack by notaries have the same courage in presenting the bill to the state budget?
Next in his time.
Okay, thanks, JYL.
@lol No State is comparable to households with regard to the management of their budget, because the state's temporal horizon is theoretically over when the household's life is tied to its members.
In addition, unless it is considered that public expenditure is unproductive, it contributes to the financing of material and intangible investment in tomorrow's growth and thus future revenue.
Some elements of the answer.
A sad decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrate: the health of the benefits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first.
Nice theory of the plot.
Unfortunately the truth does not match your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands tied by the law as written by the politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risked surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them in the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to please the uncultivated masses.
In fact, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with drugs Since the Liberals want our health system to look like the United States, you should know how it works.
Everywhere in the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been a misconception of the problem on the pipelines, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business benefits and to "search".
So read a few rare reports about our pharmaceutical benefits scheme and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare global drug prices everywhere, as well as differences between country and country on what is being sold free or only on order.
This is strengthened by a political and economic process, not by a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that impede them and the necessary permits.
Although manufacturers of certain medicinal products may not be happy to use alternatives such as marijuana, those who arrive at a good-quality version at well-known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're mistaken, there's a lot going on in the meds and the pharmacy.
With regard to this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put a hole in the ear of a responsible person in this hospital.
We can't keep patents on the grass...
If "scientists" were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, their "work" could be used.
One researcher does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing it isn't a search.
Comparing this is not the teaching of research.
You can't say "the research is done" and then in a single jet "you have to experiment at all".
If your research is completed why experiment?
If your research is not completed why do you ask to apply it?
Can I explain how a "researcher" can draw that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could be easier to assimilate mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow students to learn by the condition that they learn to use new technologies, but how could they learn new technologies if they do not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator we make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that will satisfy us.
What is the purpose of building an indicator that tells you what's going on, a self-promotion will, a fraud?
One way to train teachers is to get away from training sophists and ideologists and that practitioners teach practitioners.
factory release the paragraph on the internships (which helas is not very reasoned) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads first and foremost to the reproduction of current practices, and which does not allow the system to progress " .
In view of the general consensus on the status of the French system, it is not possible to wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have all their place in modern teacher training
Theorists of education must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical and who has never set foot in a previous operating block?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the educational system.
Giving more weight to education theorists would definitely destroy it.
Your analogy is completely furious: if I don't want to be operated by a practitioner who only has a theoretical training, I'd like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the bag.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative Member in charge of the fight against copyright violation by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmayers thank you.
If one day I begin to feel guilty about violating the copyright, I will just read an article like this one.
In an information economy, copyright violation = theft.
That's the same thing because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license doesn't cost anything.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not exactly the same thing.
By using the content without a proper license, you deprive artists of their bread.
You can always debate assumptions - but it's about the flight.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become so true.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I'm starting to feel guilty for violating the copyright
Obviously, this does not bother you to deprive artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, a almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they leave any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions they have clicked.
Perhaps if they share their mp3 ballader's listeners with a friend on the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in this way.
Ah if we could export this resource to which we look, the rumor that everything goes wrong....
If it's a PS Member who says it, then we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they're older to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing changed from here.
France constantly pulls people down in their assistants.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What brings France down is speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in private business ever since.
I have had the chance to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm paid because I know I don't have the skills to run a company and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the zero patterns I often meet.
At ease in my basketball I totally share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, if compared to German companies that French business leaders are constantly quoting to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized enterprises - What do French employers expect to do so?
What is the state holding their hand?
That state they accuse of impertinence?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-practice couple of bosses on your part!
Remember, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be as severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is facing an unresolved problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who hesitate and fail to wait for the permanent assistance of the State!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Labour Code, employers' fees, taxes, work 45h/week 35 paid, and some, walking on eggs, are reluctant to claim the reduction of wages or their removal!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
What's ironic is the way people always complain about First Group.
According to what I see from where I am, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep afloat instead of transforming themselves.
That doesn't mean the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of them.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we don't have the power to do this, hello.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't make it.
But well, the Labour is gonna get us bored, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They are already operating trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral enterprise and taking part in the calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all that for the decision to be finally cancelled.
And there is better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well the Labour, as they have repeated during the referendum campaign, is entirely for sharing and sharing and believes that workers must all step beyond the borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision;)
It may be because Dutch management is on good tracks while British management is not.
What ScottRail needs is not just a change of owner but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous system of franchises, not the franchisor.
"It was a beating girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate this kind of expression.
To assume that being "beating" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancer "beatings", which are not less dead, I know of palanques.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, we're gonna start again.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you it's AIDE.
There's nothing to do with any merit...!
When in the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
It's a fresh start.
Insinuating, it would be only a moment, that we can have the merit of getting out of a disease or that we can afford not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that looses, everywhere, despite will, despite trust in medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C?
To think the contrary, if, having a strong morale certainly allows for easier acceptance and preparation of heavy treatments, to try experimental treatments as this woman did, and not to refuse them with fear.
Someone who's fighting in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts in medicine.
But if we prefer to go back to "Lord" it's another thing.
Neither with dignity nor with courage.
These considerations are for moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you're getting rid of yourself to become just a zombie.
Personally, I've caught two, some salads, some big ones, and if I've beat myself up like these psychologists say, it's completely out of my mind.
Unless this fight only involves closing your teeth, suffering from hell and beatings.
I thought the charge against Milosevic had been decided and terminated a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's an anniversary.
A forgotten anniversary.
His trial was carried out "fast" and then rolled under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
Did the communist become a nationalist who launched three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the World Rule of International Law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
Regarding RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why do you not mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians, then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against the attacks of NATO, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he were to defend him, he would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The West used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign State that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was soon recognized by Western States that then eventually lied on the ground.
The Serbian population has now disappeared completely (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office because he could not understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Finally, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as a tyrant (even if we don't like him).
At my knowledge there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece goes near, measuring the level of piezoelectric in the quartz.
This kind of study is certainly useful and thanks for making us share the results.
A hope therefore, but caution is to put This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus, which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by the Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
Method to be followed.
Like those who involve animals that feel threatened to arrive.
Thank you.Sciencemaker to regulate us, often, of these experimental breakthroughs that are carried out in the world.
How would animals know (In advance)?
No doubt the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the case of earthquakes.
Like the radon, for example.
A gas has indole priority for man but may be detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments he has.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has always been observed (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with seismic conditions, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report telling the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to acknowledge the validity of their work on animal sensitivity to terrestrial magnetic fields, and in particular their modification before a seismic.
Well, of course I'm not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature...
If we look at things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by animals, we meet in the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a seismic earthquake the red fish was about to spin.
I don't understand that we can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can't stop thinking that this man knows nothing and he's always trying to make fun of a joke.
He never responds directly to any of this.
He also said that he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari asked him what.
He couldn't name one point.
He made so many promises to make himself a mayor and he didn't keep one.
It only points out to what extent the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and that people are inspired to worship celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him, and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the direction of the party, the popularity of the Tories will break the ceiling I am certain of.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister either.
That's exactly what we said about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpage, smarter than he
In many respects, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as President.
The French have really and always been disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have been given the punishment of reading a few books (there is, among them, a French and excellent B.
Millot), the “Solomon” and the “ferral line” speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there from the Battle of Savo) did not want to return.
We actually passed before the island of Savo, in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission reaches that end.
It's the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total swelling.
Calculate the kerosene consumed to achieve the goal of fully decrediting the concept..
It's enough to go through the list of sponsors that are philanthropes.
An operation of coma has not been done or done.
The cow, it gives too much desire!!!
I'm looking forward to the website!
Your story reminds me, identifying me a little by the wayside (I also learned to navigate with the Crocos de L'Elorn in Moulin Blanc in Brest!).
Hat also for the environmental message, even if some criticize the impact of the move.
The end justifies the means.
Keep telling us again, and show with pride that the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think the red doll that has manifested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the British Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local communities and public bodies should not spend any of our taxes on financing the dreams of some even as sympathetic adventurers as they are!
Are there players in the current Serbian training that is of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bayjevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once in Juventus and now in Fenerbahcze, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team
It's Bisevac, Lyon's defender, not Bajevic.
Bayjevic was in the middle of the field or earlier in the 1970s and 80s and led many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bayjevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the great team of Velez, who, under the protection of legendary Suleman Rebecca, completed twice in the second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had scores such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just curiously, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a big player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was connected to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Count arrived, then he went to Fener and as far as I know he's not the owner.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of true Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of the Great Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (which I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not what is called the Great Albania, but Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give the neighbouring countries a blow of the country.
How could we have felt "an explosion of joy" when we saw two towers collapse, knowing that women, men and undoubtedly children are inside?
How???
What makes me a little bit confused in this "witness", is that the only thing that has ever been able, is once, to enjoy the horrific death of thousands of people, is to witness to a "border line" personality whose all "witnesses" should be taken with the greatest circumspect.
Without a doubt, in the short time of "joy", no thought will have been given to the dead or to the reality of the terror inflicted.
We will have just thought, one moment, that for once Muslims had succeeded in doing truly and apocalyptic evil to the great evil Satan in his own heart.
Make qqch powerful.
Great.
It would seem that this feeling was shared by thousands of Muslims who were devastated by their feelings of humiliation.
With witnesses filmed in Palestine.
Classic Shrew.
We were a little suspicious.
The West "Christian/Blanc/Gaulois" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general poverty, social and cultural underdevelopment of the Muslim Arab world today.
I'm talking about Cairo or Algiers, not Dubai Towers.
The past splendor, certainly magnificent, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How do we get the Muslim world out of this devilish intone?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigated the Arab world l: the conservativeism of power in place and the fascinating nihilism.
The common point, the ice of thought and the excommunication (sweet or armed) of its critical expression.
Whatever we understood before, we must not make Muslims retreat.
It's the only way.
Do you want to read this article?
I suppose it's true in many countries.
But in Britain, the fall marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressed months that affect the well-being and humour of many.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and for those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for humor and well-being.
The autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
In particular, the campaign is cutting off the blast in the fall.
Not as much to cut the breath as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of being at the point of death.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls a week-end.
We had a great time this year, don't make your grins that scratches!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I no longer develop immunity to germs outside, it can change, I suppose.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of exciting smells, with a fever that culminates in festivals such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of swelling and full of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the parties for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the control of child enhancements , this is the amount charged by the State mainly from the ranges 8 to 10 .
However , as regards the number of households that have seen their tax increase after this measure , these are , in particular , the declines 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to Figure 2 .
The elimination of the half relative to widows is not entirely treated in the article, or its impact is entirely assessed: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and does not understand that it is painful.
And it's not ready to settle.
Well, we're not on the right track, but we're dreamers.
Once the PS makes a policy instead of the left, we won't cry...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let's continue and you'll encourage these 20% if you don't work or leave.
Well, I know it's not politically correct, but I say it anyway.
Live the Trots and OICs recycled to the PS: they understand everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax, that's when he forbids anyone to collect as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, the money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is exceeded, money is only used to make money, that is to say, to make the worst of the number.
We are among the richest 20%.
There is no doubt that 20% of households work the most (and create the wealth of which a part is logically re-distributed).
A fair tax must enable these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or so much lower your arms and live with social minorities, especially if you have social housing.
The utopia of the red Khmer head cutters have lived happily.
I've done two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to present ourselves to the reception or deal with the least anxiety.
It's enough to go to someone's house, sleep in it, sort out behind him and leave.
I hope this will be my first option when I'm on my way.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you will need some kind of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the good logo!
Ah, 6 o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, it's not true.
You just really missed your chance.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
In 24 hours, after an e-mail from Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locker to change locks, made arrangements for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he did not receive any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive how to travel
Hi, I'm looking for people who have already used bnb air just to reassure me.
I plan to pay an account and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send $1,600 to a site that I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Support the troops," the Bu$herie sang on every tone...
So harmless weapons.
I'm sure this will please the families and close to thousands of dead Kurds in halabja to learn that their parents and friends have done something other than chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain poly).
Furthermore, in what way would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the author's style: "to seek weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is this always the time to strengthen education, because we are still in war?
Education would already be much strengthened if "they" worked 35 hours instead of 17.
At present, our teachers are gaining more than engineers.
And that we don't believe that teachers spend 6 hours a week preparing their program.
But this is not visible because National Education does not have the means to provide an office to college/lycée to its professors, so they are at home.
Some kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay the computer, Internet connection, or supplies.
Besides, it's so much the level at 5:00 a.m. every week and 4 months of vacation that we can't complete the MATH CAPES, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to be bitten by poorly educated sheep whose parents yell at you when they treat you like a goat?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the khurde population can better expand.
Where we can see that Bush administration has absolutely everything through.
My first job as a diplomat in London was to win three times and yet it was a job for which a diploma was needed.
A year later, I saw an announcement to work for the London Metro, it was paid £5,000 more a year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, don't do it if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something either that pays well or you like to do it.
If I'd stayed at my job, I'd still have to pay my student loan.
I don't like business so much, so I hope to go through both the public service and the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is very late!
Exactly when I got my degree in 2011 there was already a three-year-old behind.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of bisoonour threads such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is what we call unemployment diplomas.
I have one of these diplomas and I have finished the production director.
It has been found that the major was not the diploma but, as the article above said, a good professional course, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course the starting salary was lower but we quickly raise the scales because in the real world what counts is the results more than knowledge.
This debate has been in the course of engineering studies/articulations for years.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems; it is more important to be able to get out in the morning, get to work at the time, and interact with people in a way that brings results.
Are letters, philosophy, and art bisoonor wires?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about diplomas such as media study or whatever the absurd branch where you're going.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are real branches.
We need people who can explain the big questions to the high school students, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and who appreciate them.
Wouldn't this be a real territorial policy to disengage Paris and stimulate the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the residents of the finals of Essonne and Val-d'Oise to make 80km back every day on bicycle to come to work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the intra-muros and the small belt already have many more practical means of transport in common (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and key-closed parks, as they already exist in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
In this case, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
Both benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for a SEUL bicycle coupling device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, that's not gonna work.
When discussing with pedestrians and other users of the common transport for reasons that they do not pedal, it seems to me that the main reasons that arise are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these trucks, these trucks, these scooters that run super fast and run the survival of bicycles 2/ we take full pollution into the head For me the cyclable tracks are roads to go, it is necessary to reduce traffic (urban pay type congestion charge), reduce speed (Paris = zone 30), make respect for the road code by systematically verbalizing (even the bicycles in the mud before it needs to adapt the code of the written road for bicycles 100 years ago), to generalize the buffer areas after the passing of the tires, and do not pass safely.
Cycling trails are apartheid, but the occupation of urban space needs to be rebalanced.
Nothing on the bike in the big Paris?
Isn't there a word about the place of the bike in the public transport?
ELV is right.
The target of 15% of travel by sail is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think Anne Hidalgo was rolling greens in the flour.
In addition, in the light of the OR report, the EELV members seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, you better find who's really hiding behind this massacre.
Index: it's not Russia.
Not sure to like the way the world evolves.
That looks terrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case to the CEDH, but I did not hear that a complaint had actually been filed.
Moreover, they should first submit complaints in Germany or Ukraine.
I also hope that these cases will be settled pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow Pan Am 103 anymore.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for the security of the airspace, in which case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been hit previously, Ukraine launched in the area of air attacks on rebels, and any aircraft could certainly be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Did the Ukrainian government take reasonable precautions in view of a clear threat or have it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people to make airlines pay for the travel rights of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their supposing government / the ultranationalists of Western Ukraine - and who want to demonstrate in large measure that Putin has hit the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their heavens.
Previous: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the CIA's supply of weapons to the rebel forces of the Treaties in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not allow this case to go to CIJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott means Putin that Australians were murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can provide evidence to support his claims.
So far, the investigators haven't said anything like that.
Calling Ricardo and being such an echoie, it's painful!
Calling Polare is losing the north is fun.
The only question is, is today's poorer than yesterday's poorer?
I can't help but notice that those who are most virulently criticizing Pickety's book have not read it!
It's easy to read, I've spent a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of income from work, property of capital, merit and inheritance in the term log.
It shows that the concentration of the capital today coincides with that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, showing that it is the 2 world wars that have reduced the concentration of capital from 1914 to 1945, and how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You're not looking at what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pave, knowing that the concentration capacity of an individual has a few limits.
Then, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is fair, we can discuss it without having read the book whose essence is to argue in a unique way in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you been reading it?
Is the central thesis of his paua summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it and I won't read it.
So I'm in the summary of her central thesis, and that's the one that seems to me to be just smoking.
The notion of the difference between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has mankind not been fully enriched?
And this wealth added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the price without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope that this price will not be a burden to the young girl and that she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes of happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little weird.
She thanked her father for giving her much freedom, but mentioned that if she wasn't where she is now, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Is Malala herself not part of these "colored perverts"?
You should have no "antenna time" on this site.
You're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when she was shot at.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equality of rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive higher education and have the right to decide on her own marriage.
However, it is someone unusual in Pakistan, as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to marry at 14 years of age, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't tell you in a way that's enough.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she would have said that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age
Rather disappointed by this entry into season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who apparently has a little trouble finding her character as Marlene Dietrich.
I've just seen the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that it's one of the best horrors, one of the smartest!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the anachronic Life on Mars of Bowie is simply overthrowing.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I'd rather have a look at 13 episodes over 3-4 months.
But one thing is sure, outside Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's mostly the risks of making scenes and mountings that sat me down.
In AHS, there is an avalanche of original plans that does not unduly ridicule the acceptance of today's productions.
It escapes me a little while to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next season without even waiting to be able to enjoy the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but, you say so well, there are many other things.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside of technical qualities.
And I'm looking a lot for her.
Then I find that the series is writing, she wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them do 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it'll end up like 24 hours of chronos what.
But everyone does what he wants!
That's why I say "I won't look anymore" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I just share my view of nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be dead.
But then, here, it's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - cut instead into state expenditures.
No, let's increase our spending, please.
Those who wanted to know about the expenses failed.
Start discussions on relatively small expenditure items, such as development assistance
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to call for and during all this time some, in each camp, seem to make these nuances much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clear in their game and find them of bad faith.
Less than 1 per cent of expenditure.
The "debts" are assets mainly held by financial institutions in that country.
The "debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would not see any problem with the government getting a third of my income (even before talking about taxes on consumption) if I thought it was going to be used in a good way.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been entirely honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to low-cost windmills and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you arrive at a figure that makes the Labour and Lib-Dem tax really ridiculous on the most luxurious residences.
Your first £10 000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 per annum will pay approximately £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10 000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 will pay about £70 000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vineyard, and it's before VAT.
Almost 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and car vignette.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not seem to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it's not important to know where billions of tax books go.
How can a unemployed person who is looking for work at the door prove it?
Even though 20% of the unemployed would not be looking for it, that means 80% are looking for it and they are not finding it.
Since I'm unemployed myself, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CV, it increases my chances.
In fact, I haven't had any news from Pôle Employ for months, which means that agents are more engaged in control operations than really returning job announcements?
I don't see the interest.
Because it's not for the State to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then you must move from Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive matter?
We all have rights and duties, and in this case, it is ensured that the unemployed are well fulfilling their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requires a transport title to users by means of a means of transport, a service manager or employees of their work, etc.
Nobody screams at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times when I had a business in Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to stand firm.
It's taking time!
I'm not an expert in law.
The schedule and control is currently taking place, whereas Pôle Emploi is legally close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the issue of compensation should only concern employees, who pay the costs.
Non-wage French politicians and politicians are granted rights they do not have!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance is part of the value of paid work.
More than waiting for Arab killer tweets...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then be similar to the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and displacement of the population at that time.
The Saudis had the spirit of banning the Hadj in Mexico this year from the Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their request for a visa refused because of their country of origin or their recent travel.
In fact, there was a case of a pilgrim who came from Bosnia who contracted the variable in Mexico during Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim who came from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola's patients from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was a simple sense, but apparently those "knowing" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
No one's lucky.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they will stay there until they are healed.
These are not draconian measures.
Nothing but last week, people were contaminated after having had contacts with people in West Africa although they took "all the necessary precautions".
We can stop the advance of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let us prohibit them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical symptoms of Ebola, so that they can be placed in quarantine immediately.
That he can pass the message of the first individual and of the group (including religious) second and he will have earned the Nobel Peace.
I doubt he will be able to raise in dogma the image of God characterized by the entire cortex of the planet in operation.
It's still far from this concept here.
It has only been 20 years since the information appeared as the first given of humanity, while religion, from the brain, may lead our actions since Lucy.
What is the interest of becoming a ninth Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticise would not put their feet to the Church in any way, there is only the low number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we take away the notion of sin, too "anxiety"?
@louise: Sorry the church has no limited vision in France.
And in the world, it might be enough to touch more worlds...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you consider it to be pre-existing in Christ.
Hillel a century before he was already saying to him, "Don't do to anyone what you don't want us to do to you, that's all the Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!"
Christianity goes well beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces a monkey.
Your "to advance justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is that a return to communism? :-)
Next step: Incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who has disturbed moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be willing to play their part in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forced into immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game will soon come out.
It doesn't make up.
I would personally choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 well (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM to £30 and also offers a 20% discount.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM to £30 and also offers a 20% discount.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The delights of the IT department block all pleasant sites.
Hello, is it 30 £ then 20% reduction, or is it that 30 £ includes 20% reduction?
Attention however: PC version is only for DX11.
It surprised me, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund is zero.
It's time to buy a new video card *make the hole*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveator and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon 30 £ for PC, 35 £ for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 £ for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid one day they'll make your library work if they decide to sue people who buy it while they're out of the area.

So was France of 1940 a "putrid land"?
So tell me, this Nobel Prize seemed to me like a poisoned gift.
You have to love France at 40, the "defeated stranger"?
When we see who gets the Nobel literature, we wonder if Proust or Dostoïevsky would have it today.
Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobel laureates are more credible but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso only have a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, they.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at its fair value, if they don't already know him!
On your side, continue to attend Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso preserve all their chances.
So let's see who got the literature Nobel: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Since I took one in Iceland, I haven't stopped seeing Kia Sports everywhere.
I think this thing has been following me so far.
Maybe she wants to screw me up?
Or am I like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, always hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my doctors.
It's Wednesday!
I've had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to Nottingham's beer and cider party.
It was brothel.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were only CMRA fans (not to be confused with camera fans).
Driving on Sunday's return was really hard.
Monday night we went to the grandfather of a pot to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real starter chance, I was able to leave with several decades.
I hope if I get to 95, I'll be as strong as him.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came up with a lot of hot stuff.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That says, without wishing to contradict you, I think you're getting a little away from the subject.
This famous whole, it prohibits searches for Djijadists at the exit of the mosques.
She's signaling weapons traffic without delay.
Either we have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
You have to choose.
It's not by keeping our eyes closed that we can access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you are making a monumental contradiction: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, whether Muslim or not, having formally condemned the EI and its crimes, whether French or Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these official unanimous condemnations.
Who doesn't say a word of consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoch Marvel, the doubt exists for everyone.
As I said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be foolish and inadvertent to accuse them of prioritising them and to demand that they manifest themselves publicly to prove to the rest of the French society that it is wrong to doubt them.
In my view, this principle is the denial of the Republic and can only help to eradicate French society.
If there's no doubt, just say it.
Who doesn't say consent, but consent to what?
It allows for closeness with IE or the conviction of IE.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to house the goat and the goat.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically intensible.
Alex Salmond predicted that in the elections, Scotland could "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because an enormous collapse occurred between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised to watch the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified to lose all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely out of Scotland as they have no seats.
They can do whatever they want in any electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's going to pay for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP, which will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMISE" thinking that he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death penalty for his Scottish deputies.
Not surprisingly, some Labourers are asking for accounts from their leader.
If the SNP has 20-25 seats and there is no majority in Parliament, even if the seats do not come from Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both Conservatives and Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think it's important.
Not if the Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Closing the pumps by 8% to 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish Members are no longer able to vote on matters relating to England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists, and she did it well.
However, he is still in high school to be prime minister in 2015 and since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, in large, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is the "Life of the Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for monitoring techniques.
Finally, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next ticket: Amazon manufactures your book based on your profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of your secret!

Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have the reading of pirated files, public domain books or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without flies.
I see the price I paid Kobo, it's no regret.
I am concerned about the widespread abdication of users against the generalized appropriation of their private lives.
At your large public library, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding bosses whose opening and closing rates are undoubtedly annoying.
For example, James Joyce’s “Finnegans Awake ”
@Thomas: In the Big Data era, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Attention not to put all the literature in the same bag.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
These are the data published by Kobo which is not able to identify readers or authors.
But Kobo's got all this information, he's got it.
There have been so many exaggerated, incorrect and contradictory statements by the Turkish Government in recent days that the country seems to be led by a mother class full of schizophrenic acid-based girls.
It's even worse than taking Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account.
It is interesting that some Erdogan supporters think Islamist is such an insult that they understand your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey didn't want to get a ball in the foot unless it won something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it's actually getting a ball in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: "The AP reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to try to overthrow Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad's law because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent a serious warning of reprisals or merely advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what is truly surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
Indian Punchline's reading is highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the c*lines balanced by traditional media. The short article you're linking to is important and should be read in mind by keeping in mind the actual observations/warnings that Iran has come up with on a proposal from Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderate" who seriously fight the horrible lay Assad and at the same time the evils of ISIS?
The policy of pipelines moves the world towards the abyss, and I would suggest those who refer to "moderate" non-existent ones to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"It is even worse than taking into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Is there any other religious fundamentalists in the Middle East?
I've got a head.
It would take a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should we?
Do you realize that neither criminals nor victims have the least chance of being still alive?
A little late for that, my wallet...
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Especially regarding the triumph of the CUP who planned and led the genocide, Talat and Djemaal killed just after World War 1 by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a poor location in Central Asia near the same time, when there was a dream of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a deal!
An impressive master of the sophism of the fatal pen, but apart from this, we are looking for a vain contact with the real.
That's all that clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even into the belly of a portable mother.
The lesbian couples can simply be a child's desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Hetero-sterile couples too.
About the kids!
What a shame to name them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their life and to pay for this woman's retirement (?)
The GPA is undoubtedly a temporary "solution" in the evolution of the medicine that our world knew.

Many women brought and brought into the world children who were not their husbands.
It's still like this, we're done like this...
The important thing in this regard is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren't they also body marketing? !
Anakronik Fariheit ...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good in a remote country via the Internet and Pay Pal than to inflate its responsibilities and or avoid the scandal in another century near home without shouting it at this time on all roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done on behalf of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
There is no less than the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.

I don't know why there are so many shocking comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they are posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article on the foot waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there is a lack of reports that really reflect the reality of North England's culture.
Nothing surprising that Paul Mason has taken the social and political context well, he fully understands things.
The Northern soul is still alive, but it has been vampired by capitalism and today is essentially a surface phenomenon.
This says, you can listen to it if you are in the London region in November: 99poul will again pass the soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here is a small article well written and well thought.
your critics really need to be more constructive.
That's a great article.
I loved your documentary.
I suppose you're happy to have escaped from Newsnight.
Last train for Victoria/Exchange Wigan and get down to Wallgate.
They're eating pills.
Whatever the train before Wigan was ince, 15 minutes at Wigan's foot after buying a ticket to stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently police series called Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.

Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-coloniser (and that was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahou and their electors all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He wore his clothes, put them on the rock and went into the water.
An Israeli had stolen them.
The Israeli representative got angry and said, "What are you talking about?
The Israelites were not even there at the time!".
The representative of Palestine (UN) said and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not lose their guard ...
What moves the anti-Israelites is evidence, it is not the aim sought ...
Antisionist: But I answered, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And it's always like this since politics is globalized...
Avoid, avoid...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain that it will be lost!
For Israel's creation, you don't answer.

Antisionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a strong report today!
You doubt ?!!! ...
Besides, this doesn't just go around Russell Brand, but the Guardian's journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Much of what he says is only pseudo-chomskyste tapes written by others.
That's who proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a result of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter loves it well, which means it's an immaturity issue).
A really vicious charge, with just a suspicion of the awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths that we prefer not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling will be getting more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horripile some: he sometimes speaks allegedly and after all the absurdities of tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a populist beginning, but all this story of not voting has been completely misunderstood by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and instead to ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles / videos he has posted, he says that once every 5 years only vote for the Labour Party or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limit the democratic commitment to this is completely unnecessary, both parties (at slightly different degrees) ruling primarily in favour of particular interests, multinational companies and rich people, at no time he says simply to ignore politics because these parties do not govern in our name: he insists that instead of just voting and disengageing themselves for five years, people should be allowed to become involved in politics, to become involved in politics, to become more involved in politics, to become more involved in politics and to become more involved in politics.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active by presenting his requests can go away with voting, given that politicians are giraffes who will change their mind if they really risk losing the elections), but it's good to see all these condensing answers that this idiot who makes Jesus tell young people not to take the punishment to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it really distorts his arguments.
His solution is extremely controversial, and it would be good if people were discussing what he really said rather than simply labeling him irresponsible and putting aside his concerns and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The item on the vote was completely deformed.
I am deeply upset that my vote does not really count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their voters.
In addition, I contest the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his (written by others).
It is smart enough to have its own speech and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of thinkers and anti-establishment universityers from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "seudo-chomskyste billives".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne does like Polly Toynbee and interviews Russell on a veranda, with even the head hooks lined up at the assembly!
As Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him to his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It is possible in a political speech that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This "fronde" in particular reveals to me that the intellectual debate has long since been held at the RDV of History, where trade historians have become minority and trades of specialists have become available to the benefit of the ready-to-thinking Condensed Sciences Po for press records.
For my part, I had seen in Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude as well as Michel Foucault's, a need to take it to a guilty, an emissary.
They develop each other's very rational reasoning, but this rationality is based on these emitters that are the key to their thinking.
Instead, I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a guilty person.
This is a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
The problem of the report to the other party is resolved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchy, neo-lib and / or libertarian pen (in both terms the second marks a hardening desire for the eradication of the state , the first to seek the State's assistance for its markets ) in the sense of less of the state / not of the whole state in Foucault .
The old dream of the base that is beautifully self-organized.
Its thought is built on the guilt of the State: without that guilt, it does not stand.
Who says guilty, who says elimination, who kills, who sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals quoted here.
Not even support.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, the one of his god of then, Stalin, the little father of peoples.
Oulala, you have probably read a chouya too quickly if you have taken the texts of Foucault on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchett puts a deep focus on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, it is an original and respectable thinker.
See this cabal orchestrated by researchers in human sciences from the hard left who do not support the passage from the alloy to their mantras, it is quite responsible.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is unlimited.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellow" I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends talk about it, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were kind to me when they learned I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think so of the Whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them have violent anti-Blanc talks.
My father's not happy that his old girl goes out with a White.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are becoming richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I have been told, the Russians are particularly prejudiced against temporary workers with no qualifications originating in the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the views of the Australians about the Chinese and the Aborigines.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I don't support Chinese, while I met two of them in my life (one of them abroad), didn't keep bad memories of them, all the people got used to and, in fact, those from London were very kind, that's the only reason why I remembered that they were Chinese.
If we don't remember who we meet, everyone's gonna be happy, how to remember who we were.
Do you know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here speak Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that White guy.
How many Chinese men are with Whites, by comparison?
None, because there are many chances that the parents of these Whites would assault them PHYSICALly.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France that remains manipulated by groups marked to the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the judicial environment is frankly marked right.
When it comes to the judiciary union, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of partiality can be taken on the basis of the relativity of the application of the laws in the courts, it shall order that two obstacles be removed.
That of the observer's political vision as that of the actual interpretation of the magistrate.
It remains the law's mandatory tool to refocus assessment on fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, forces to distinguish between error and the partisanity of magistrates.
It should be argued that the acts of justice do not divide between these three groups.
Claims and ignorance are not part of an objective analysis.
And if all this has not been analysed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only by statistics that implicitly reveal that it is very low.
The previous preamble allows for a good inclusion of what follows in the third ratio.
The corruption* of the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is given to the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The area in question is that of the fragmentation* of heirs made up to the crucifixes of the procedure* by successive genealogies sent by notaries.
This profession is awarded a fine year of EUR 150 million while receiving the coverage* provided by the almost judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For their understanding of the mechanism, a part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where there is such a statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogists and heretics, a whole set of cases which are contrary to all the laws that favour the heretics.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring this kind of rational criteria a form of lie?
Surely absolutely prohibitive prices.
More of the equipment to trap the disabled.
You can say that, but my brother has one of these three-cycles all over the ground, built in measure at his size and weight, and this really allowed him to enjoy the full air as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and tyres on it, could not.
As you may say, the tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could invent a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks like EPIQUE.
I don't think Whill's inventor ever had to clean up a dog crotch on a chain.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all over the ground, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a longboard pen.
Here are some hills that they would like.
Prices actually seem to be high, but there really are people who put this kind of price in a bike, so "you see".
The tricycle of all the land seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor, however.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know we need.
We can't really say that Wheel is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a drawing, it's not planned to make it.
I am glad that the long-distance wheelchair does not reach the market, because apparently there is no way to drive this trick.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli bloc of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people under 18 years of age.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation as well, as this bloc imposes a "collective penalty" on all citizens of Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs working on their projects turn a little bit from their cement to the black market " ...
Ah, that's not the wood language, it's concrete and armed the lady...
The references are here to support an argument or fact.
Antisionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's a black market that's certain, and it's recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli bloc of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The United States has a well-maintained land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn't have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by what you know) excluded it!
Don't forget that after he got up, Morsi had restored the block!!!
And I'm a Western, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Block is Israel-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live on a underground fortress, built around the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat, it's a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you've thought that through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is the very definition of the sharing economy, without profit.
Many are only looking for one night on Couchsurfing.
So it is to be paid (or at least to expect it) in another way.
It's always much less expensive than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
In addition, owners and trusted tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly with cash, thus turning Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this.
"What does she rent on" ?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to letter" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international journal now, in case you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% consistent with all the security rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers for permission to engage in commercial activity (which they will definitely refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought that boats can be moved, stolen and returned, rolled, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would always be close to where you left it.
Or deranged by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our penises...
Where are you going to make it bitter?
No Marine Le Pen's not right!
Populism?
There is no truth but that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth between the richest hands is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the mass will be said!
Capitalism won't turn out!
The high finance, speculative, plays with our businesses, our jobs, our raw materials, our purchases, our food, our health care structures, our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold..
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obeses of the fear.
To the contrary, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is the finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed Minister of the Economy an elder from the Rothschild Bank, a story to better defend the interests of bankers, only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else in charge?
You call this how: to return his dress, to lower his pants?
Primary and populist response
Actually, we don't know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where'd you see that?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee has really "refused" to help the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cook in the area.
The sea was bright at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after the sun was set, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Malouins, where, on the photos showing survivors as they are being rescued, we see a calm and full day sea.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, that doesn't really correspond to what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion occurred among the German ships as to the fate of the two Kurassed cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they had stopped shooting, and a quick race began.
Leipzig lives something in fire, but by approaching it it lives that it was only a sword.
The Nuremberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and lives the Monmouth, painted and severely damaged but still in motion.
After placing its projectors on the ship's flag, the proposal to leave was refused and it opened the fire, which finally flowed the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 22.15 p.m.
Concerns about reports indicating a British kerosene in the vicinity, he put his head to the north. ”
So, if this is true, the Germans, in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had flown, and could therefore not seek survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important Cussette of the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they withdrew to take advantage of their progress.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should break a path through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their munitions, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes are taken to the UMP to request that it be included in the law that a definitively convicted electorate be definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch left-wing electors well on.
But noon, it's a joke.
IN THE CHAIR: MRS.
When is the ban on trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality be tolerated among citizens?
Irrespective of politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, they are always eager to amend those themselves who will benefit from their inevitability to prevent the actions of real policies, which are really trying to make things move, not the beautiful talky whose immobilism is at the level of their adequacy.
I met them in the subway at noon with their little pancards" from the streets for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members place enormous power on the part of their party.
It would not defend the same thesis if right-wing, or extreme-right, trade unions were to target the personalities of his side and lead to a legal-media war against them.
Your statements are totally free.
If, at present, the law deplores the judicial currentity, it is simply that it has committed the facts that are relevant to it!
There is no example of left-handed personality that has so much to do with justice, but all those who have been the object of his attention have not had favor treatment.
On the other hand, it must be remembered that the union of the left-wing judiciary is not the only union of magistrates and that it is minority.
That a minister supports with so much commitment the unions show how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you're quoting may be minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancellery, it's not a secret.
It is now asked whether the "mission" of certain judges is not more out than instructing.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that judges are not civil servants like others: they are the only ones to have the power to accuse and incarcerate everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most hungry weak of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepted their offer.
Many have been used as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills the stages of the world.
Others then sold a lot of disks or went to West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, which is actually part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all have won the Eurovision contest, as well as so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else have participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the British TV's light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that is what happens in any way to most stars who do not participate in the competition.
Rarely are those who, after a tube, manage to do it to others.
In any case, most singers/groups can best expect three albums and one best of them.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, there are only fans in the United Kingdom.
His fame comes partly from his marriage with a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it is more likely to emerge on a career than the typical rock walk, even if in your dreams you think that all guitar-smokers who smoke from the grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a primary level poem will certainly become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before even getting out of an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it creates a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that turns quite quickly to racism, because the sacrast ethnologists present us as infinitely superstitious and petri of ritual bigotry, while most of their ways are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, practical considerations per day.
Unless you imprudently interpret in the opposite sense.
Anyway, rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our way is like being reminded to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article, whatever it is.
It's from the ephemeral deco to furniture the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrative figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives on.
Who still believes the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw into the minds of the interpretations of not all scientists who live a mandarin's life, rarely less.
When is a review of discipline compared to a little bit of discipline?
Because what is true for archaeology is also true for interpretations that give other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that treasures, precious testimony to rebuild history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is passionate.
This method is not very old and in the past archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and their knowledge, and could be deceived.
Today, we have such powerful technical and scientific means that the interpretation of searches is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
It is there in full (and old) controversy over the chamanism advanced by prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf. his book "The chamanes of prehistory", in particular the increased re- issue of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this highly instructive article
Heteros men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put myself in there.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't go on to three?
This journal is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the cascade?
No, but we're not against a theater room up there.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy over there on the other hand, that would be too gay!
We could expect to have this kind of comment from you.
It would be said that Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost finished, may I suggest you proceed to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real journalists, brave, to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and dangers.
Instead of making fun of these dirty ass jokes.
Not very soft.
Go on then.
If these "pure ass jokes" shock you so much, you're not obliged to participate, are you?
Do you also know that this journal also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to make both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or is it the fact that people are messing with it?
Nevertheless, you can find the video amateur crash on the net...
video amateur crash on the net... ?
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in any case that of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, it would have released the safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g., the driver) entered the circuit.
But it had to end quickly before the typhoon that was known to have arrived, but for which the FOM did not think it was good to advance the time of departure (right TV, pub, money...).
But besides that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, I also share this opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM makes the SC enter, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at re-starting the English that was then driving...
You're on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's not bad, I've got a little time to get through all your c******ries.
No, just not.
There were lots of conspiracy in F1, but never one that put commissioners at risk of death for a long history of one pilot's chances of victory at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that gets out of safety because it's the FIA.
Size nuance.
In the light of popular images, the lack of image above all allows the FIA to avoid embarrassing issues of the type: How does the Commissioner act a green flag in full intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it's not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident, but because one of the commissioners clearly has a green flag, it signifies that the race can normally resume and that we are more under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark misconception of the F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag regime after the accident place, from which the green flag is shaken.
It's the usual procedure.
The station of commissioners just below the accident (as the case may be, it can be 10 metres as 100 metres after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal schedule.
Sensationalism sells from the pub.
I used to think that the media were an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm very afraid it's just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having sex, the pub and the media are good for selling things that are supposed to improve our sexual life.
The information does exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with information that we really don't need to worry about is just to continue to scare people so they can continue to control them.
"When tabloids touch about Ebola, we all catch fear" It should be "dreaming", not "dreaming".
Given the medical reference, "tosser" is much better said in this context than "tosser".
I wonder if all people who claim that Ebola could get on the airway realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridicules this pseudo-journalism in a beautiful and solid way.
It made me laugh.
It saddens me that the media are talking about most of the things with this optimism on the other hand.
The aim is once again to keep us sufficiently discouraged and anxious (without getting to the hysteria) for the government to be able to let us down when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to face a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from the crises that he himself invented.
Is there anything fundamentally problematic about the idea of rule by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still of this world almost 35 years later.
In addition to the beginning this must have been horrific, given the context of the 1980s and 1990s.
I'm bluffed, living with certainty for years..
Perfectly useless testimony.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only do the testimonies serve nothing: taken alone, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have an adverse influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@trafic: Evidence cannot be used as scientific material.
This is perhaps why we refrain from asking questions to patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record says my psychiatric mother explains that I was taught telepathically by her beautiful mother.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's a mistake, it's a subjective witness of no importance.
Ah, because the certification of a fact (= here this testimony, which testifies to the pollution and effectiveness of new treatments) is nothing in a scientific approach?
So what are you based on?
On ghosts?
Do you set the same level of fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable evidence) ?
"Resilience": the word "bidon adulated by the grandparents, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for major psychologists after reading D'embourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of blank buzzwords of meaning in the dogs.
Cyrulnik has given us the blow of "resilience".
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will have brittled us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to highlight the Air Sentinels...
So why?
It was a great series and it would be said that those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the humour of the kind of pipe-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
The kids were hanging.
Oh, because it's a series for kids?
The UKIP is working for the Mysterons.
So keep your team in America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the sons and that the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain of redistribution the old.
The series almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; at least 40 years ago we had episodes of one hour on Saturday and Sunday at 06:00.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and can always be seen at these times.
And in addition, half an hour's episodes are now going from Monday to Friday at 0530!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades!!!
The radical Zionists have invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In addition, all Israeli excavations below and around the esplanade mosque have been unable to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the shell of mosquitoes was built.
His summit, or the Rock's dome, is sailing in the middle of Omar's mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad is ascended to Paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel is also counting on its extremists, it is good to remember him regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the plan to 2 states, and savored it continuously!).
It is also good to show the extent to which Jerusalem's annex is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize his own?
The shortest of Jewish jokes: "God be praised!"
To boast about tourism in Israel, we often see half-dwelled young Naiads on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen on the photo that illustrates the article.
That's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful propaganda work!
It is a pity that the photographer of Reuters did not take photos of hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to silence faithful Jews in contrabas, praying to the Mur de lamentations.
@Mat, if this photo bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, it's the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she broadcasts that she has to condemn.
This system is unstable and will end in tears.
The only way to end this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to be starting to collapse, large companies have benefited greatly from their employees.
They managed to convince their employees that they had the chance to have a job and that they could not afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they gave even more important rewards to the small elite at the summit.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when workers really speak of one vote.
Instead of rubbing and chewing when someone else does the strike, supporting them, showing some solidarity and understanding that their strike not only concerns their problems but also shows your employer that people are not being treated unjustly.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case it's held.
I totally agree.
The only thing you've forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
All this can't end well.
That's because we're in democracy.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by short-circuiting national governments by secret courts.
This seems incredible, but that is exactly what the dispute settlement mechanism between investors and States (ISDS) proposed by the agreement applies to.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to warn people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It is only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
That's what makes excellent results, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on the trees.
The next low mail will certainly be the car market.
This gentleman is right, at XVIII there were trade unions in all regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let there (in the end, its officers, others, no one knows anything) believe the safe-fort of the eternal values of France, and it will beat and close its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the value crisis, briefly: the dissolution of the nation's idea, having this little remnant, it is comforting.
Even if for her, it's getting more and more uncomfortable...
You still miss the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs, and I don't know what else
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm syndicating.
You've been warned, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of categorical interests, the protected professions with trade unions have already suffered enough, which has created a breach of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of a civil servant's risk.
We can very well imagine a system that ensures freedom of expression without trade unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise it's an insurance disaster.
And with the caravans that are preparing, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
I ignored Sybille's ignorance I was referring to the military and other officials, as this is the subject here...
Delete "by means of his delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
He will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in business management."
This is absolutely essential with the collapse of the information power.
And yet you probably opened, read and commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Back Off Review."??????
Wait, the section was there, everything was empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's marriage that I've been looking at, and I can tell you that some have been murdered.
In Joffrey's wedding episode we have one of the best moments (what a trumpeter: it was the wine) in television history.
So, from the pie mmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
It's the second time that the show ends with a victory of the least bad ball; no one has made such a "bum, here's my fucking cake now buff it and bow to your master"!
Maybe the additional pressure from friends and parents outside has finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all those outside persons were kept away.
And there is also this idea of "playing security, there is always next week" that disappears last week.
I like to cook, but I don't think I'm gonna get into this.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us a great deal of fun and motivate us to try new things.
Go ahead for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually spend days doing them, and they had to brittle one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to get out of, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis's house, the only real fault they could have found was the base a little dry (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard's mill didn't want, in any way Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several of the challenges of this series seem a little artificial due to time spent.
There's also the cancer that looks at, with the sun beats.
Definitely, we all succeed right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse the solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are mainly blocked by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field was falling, there would not be enough solar wind to "hunt" the stratosphere ozone.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we are confined to man they are interested in allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), warm us (less than infrared), modulate our immune system and seem to improve our morals.
The ozone layer blocks cancerous UVCs and allows you to pass UVAs and most UVBs.
Do you know that you are not obliged to be condescending and to consider your interlocutor as a stay when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was underlined in the commentary, which he himself intended to prove to be pedagogical.
Without saying that I'm a melanoma habit, the UV does only accelerate its development.
They're not provocative.
For proof: all bronzed persons do not necessarily have melanomas.
Anyway, when a tube tells you to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cave, it's better not to listen because UV is necessary for all humans.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we get him?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
Or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have found that everything can be folded if a sufficient force is applied and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the use to which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted iPhone6 as a first-line communication equipment.
But for us the others,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of interested parties have found that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied
Soap and Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
That's the fourth joke on the fold I've read in the comments today.
It is difficult to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before you install specific software, you can imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and you can hardly see how it could get back there.
So, ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...................................................
It is most likely that this is a production unit on which the iOS has not been properly installed and is therefore connected to the installed factory test code.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on everyone?
Ebay photographs clearly show the absence of FCC or CE logos and the presence of a prototype red connector.
ah the article for bobo by excellence.
We want cheap products and it is surprising that industrials produce in "industrial" but all the teachings and trade are concerned How to buffer good, bio avac 1650€ (average wage in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After everyone is free to put their priorities where they hear it.
For me, food is one.
Go without resentment. I'll kiss you.
They are called bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect reality.
It's the total breakdown of thought-reason.
They are gesticulating experts, for example, claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in truffles, joining the left-caviar, which they have sometimes left, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideologies and truffles, nor are you surprised to meet frequently criticisms about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theory as well as for all the associated details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be part of it, but I can't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of the left caviar?
And well, you're able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in short-term ecclesiasticals.
In fact, boboecolo is a part of it, but it only represents the most visible fraction of the ecclesiasticals because it is the one that infects the media.
There's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front.
She's so wrong that she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the stupendous beauty of the truth of this work.
But you just don't have any legitimacy to make a comment as you haven't spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and is always obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by not having any artistic abilities.
That's the art.
No, it's from the cocoon.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
That's not really a good thing.
It's not about an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are real dog reproductions that smoke by playing at the billiard.
To judge art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing, it's much more than just representing the reality.
If you're just looking for this, a camera will do the business.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image talk about itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are also savings: horse riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
L(honesty requires that France reduces its staff, but as all countries have done so, sometimes even more drasticly, to begin with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
Operational without support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, at a time when we observe weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defense tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local communities concerned, which are losing a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@edmond: That's what I was saying, look at where to make savings, but especially not at my house, it's really not possible at my house...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look elsewhere where the gaggie is certain.
That all who have sided little or no military thing dare come to say here, eyes in the eyes that there is no spent money in this perimeter and this without bursting to laugh...
The application of the same sentence to the entire public service and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really loud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you will understand why the Defence can be a little busy!
Well, the economies that everybody agrees to say they have to be done, should we not see somewhere?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls are killed when it comes to them, the poor, the poor.
It should be done, but especially if it doesn't happen to me because, in this case, it's a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, come on!
How to close the Grace Valley will weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
With regard to local communities, the story repeats itself to each post closure, maternity, hospital, casserole.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It is strange, a mayor of the UMP who wants compensation and does not enjoy the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most boring thing I've ever read!
This moment is embarrassing where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It is the depression to expose his Facebook son and to see that 80% of his friends began their statutes by the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're gonna make a movie.
It will certainly be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex in the bus by going to work and only realize that his shoe is back in his lap.
It's not embarrassing, it's totally con.
Not really, I think the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to swallow his emotions and close his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of his return on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
They don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie really just showed that he's all over the top of the cosmic universe that's satirical journalism!
I'm falling back!
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they can finally have the lighting and discover the incredible glamour and insurmountable genius that was driving Mr. Brooker's keyboard like a divine light.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if they're not women or transvestite.
I'm a parasite.
This shows positive developments in democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective cooperative initiatives.
To the new order we have the right to save our planet by States that play the truffles at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take matters into our own hands.
With the Commissioner they planted in their energy, all these beautiful recommendations were made....
Translate: Solar windmills and farms are the Round points tomorrow.
All funded by the con-tribable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful at the level of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the branch is not fully controlled, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided that our consumption is drastically reduced, of course.
The electricity from renewables to fight CO2 emissions?
France has nothing to do with it.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity from renewable wind or PV is already more GES on the other steps and above all of the gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittent.
The replacement of the nuclear by the revolving wind or PV would go against the fight against CO2.
Christian I am not insulting you I am the Doctor of State in Physical Sciences 1981 and I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove otherwise.
What I didn't say is that you're the one who gave me ideas. I didn't say anything about Germany. You didn't actually answer what I was saying and how all the people on the right to demolish the interlocutor I never did.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an inefficient and ineffective way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you don't have uranium extraction and construction and if you don't have the gas vapour with less effect than the Co2 is really recalling the two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power station part of the water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "South Asia giant" ...!
Last time, Pakistan won against India.
It is no wonder that most Indians who post comments do not want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it really shows your mental state.
It would have been the same if they had qualified South Asia giant India...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandore box full of corruption and mafiaosis.
With regard to ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, the Kolkata Athletico imposed 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot to do.
Compared with the billions and billions that India spends on the IPL cricket and now on football, how could we ever compete with our "breathing neighbours"...
The low cost launcher race pays cash.
Damage for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the lack of possible design is manifested only with too cold helium.
So maybe we're not in a design flaw, but we're implementing...
contrary to aranespace which is a private society, it seems well that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay the satellites in frigates who know.
This is so much more fascinating that many media take on the title of articles only - and that many readers only hold on to these titles.
In total, this creates a wrong impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
In fact, the title is not appropriate with you, it misquestions the project, while it is just a launcher problem.
