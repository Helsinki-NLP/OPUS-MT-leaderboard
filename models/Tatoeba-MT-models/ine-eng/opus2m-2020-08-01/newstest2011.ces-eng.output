What are you doing? ČSSD in Prague unknown Voldemort or sugarcane
A new city council from ČSSD will have to overcome a certain language barrier, according to everything, in order to understand their senior ODS colleagues in the Prague Council and in representation.
Diník Aktuálně.cz members of the new board from ČSSD "tested", as they know the notoriously introduced snake, which occurred at the council during the last years, when Prague was ruled by its current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which the Prague politician introduced during the previous era of the Prime Minister Paul Bém, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisedly it turned out that the new counseling concept does not understand too much.
At least they say it.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am in Prague's politics more of a novel," responded to the test of the "kmotrovski" dictionary of advice for the culture of Lukas Kaucký.
And as far as the political veteran was concerned, so did Councilman Karel Brzezin.
Maybe on the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression of what you introduce me to me that I sometimes use."
"But I don't generally know the snake."
From a dictionary whose expressions of the journal Aktuální.cz published this June before the election congress of the ODS, she chose the edition of six examples, mostly those that are notorically linked to the Prague magistrate.
Socialists were supposed to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "to go to the sugarcane", "the bull's neck", "the betrayal of the main city" and "to feed".
Three of the councillors agreed, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to lead the Prague school in the future - promised first the interview, but later he did not answer the phone.
The fifth councillor Petr Dolinek declined the flat test.
"I don't even deal with these things, and I won't appreciate the way citizens are dealing with them."
"I am now deciding how to understand within our programmes," he replied.
As has already been said, Councilman Lukas Kaucký would not know in his title that this is about the influential businessman and friend of the expressionist Bém Roman Janouskov.
"Voldemort" doesn't tell Kaucké anything, and the only term he estimated correctly in the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's Blanka's tunnel," says Kaucky, and immediately he adds, "But I know it from the news."
"I'll have to pay for some language course," he jokes.
The Golf Cave then decouples not only the Matador Karel Brezina, but also the advisor to the environment Lukas Plachý.
Both social democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukas Plachem is aware of where to find this character - is aware of the meaning of the term "to go to the sugar shop".
"That I mean to go to some Prague company," is the Plain Near Resolute that it's the seat of Janousk companies.
Like Brezina, she reminds me that knowledge is more of a newspaper than that of a dictionary like that.
In social democracy, according to the frequency of the test, there is no similar dictionary of slang expressions.
"I was happy with my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We call ourselves more names, sometimes the names are used short and the noblest names," says the President of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulinský, whose parties are named Hulda.
"At school they called me Bríza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," admits Karel Brězina.
The journal Current.cz tested the name and worked.
Council Weinert is for the parties Grandfather or less friendly Grandfather, the representative Miroslav Poche, who has pointed out fraud in the party's sponsorship before the elections, has some colleagues named "Player".
Surnames are also the only thing social democrats admit in their domestic speech.
Hulínski Prei Hulda does not like to hear, but the newspaper Aktuální.cz also noted another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor of the Tuition Law" suggests that Petr Hulínský won his title JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to restrict the torture of "magicians", she published the brochure
The women declared in Burkina Faso as witches have several common characters.
They belong more to the older generation, they can't get involved in work for example for health reasons, they're free and they don't have children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent into isolation to keep the rest of the village safe.
"The fate of this man is very rare."
"They don't even leave young healthy women because they help with work and give birth to children," describes a sister who lives in Burkina Faso's capital, West African state, aged in a special home of more than a hundred women who have grown up with their community.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure".
She issued an information brochure that should help the witch hunt to limit.
It's got a hook.
"More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," said Die Standard's newspaper Die.
Indictment from witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso's neighbor, Amy Hemmah died last week for twenty-seven years after three women and two men tortured her, poured oil and burned her.
The BBC server reported the case.
The kidnappers say it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman was given oil that was used for ritual anointing.
He just blew up after the group wanted to get out of the woman.
The isolation of "magics" supports people regardless of the level of education achieved.
Dinik Der Standard quoted a 20-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "People's spirit fires have always been dangerous," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the government is trying to control the witch hunt, he was the president himself in Gambia last year.
"The Gambian President Jammi, after his aunt's death, disbanded the extensive hunt for witches, who were supposed to share in her death and try to kill the president himself by means of black magic."
"He called for help by shamans from nearby Guinea, who, along with the police, soldiers and the president's personal protections, violently dragged randomly selected men and women from the Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanila," Amnesty International reported in its report.
On the farm, people had to take medication from herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused stomach and kidney problems.
Two prisoners didn't survive on the farm.
After international pressure, almost thousands of prisoners were finally released.
Bakal's tenant: Topi in stones, signed higher rent
The older subsidiary man stepped out of the door of the client centre of RPG Apartments "chlobarona" Zdenjka Bakaly, the largest private owner of apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under guard he carried a file and a new lease in it to three apartments: his daughter and his son, who is in execution.
All three just got the deregulation for rent.
Instead of 3500 a month, the son will pay for 2+1 second category of apartment 4100 crowns from next year.
"And there is no hot water and it must melt (stone to solid fuel, etc.)," shows the man's finger in the new covenant of his son, whose signature has full power.
"But I signed it," he explains half angered and half reprehensible.
The BytyOKD.cz Civil Society, which has designated the new terms as "unfair and unbalanced", advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when the public instructions on how to deal with them.
But the man just has his hand on it.
"One says it, the other says it," it's dark.
Ostravska is becoming a major deregulation laboratory.
After New Year's Eve, a large majority of the apartments in the Czech Republic have not yet been rented.
Currently, therefore, it was decided to visit the "laborator" personally.
The Havirůvská čekára RPG is one of four in Ostravska and on Tuesday at 9 a.m. it is already full.
The security agency and its trigger device shall immediately be provided by the door.
"Rent 2011", lights the special button on his touch display.
One leak and a piece of paper out of the machine with a number.
You can't even read "157" and your number is already on a big display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're in line in half a second.
After a while you come to ask an older couple for a rent, but you don't seem to care about new rents.
Most people have come to solve common problems, such as requests for repair, insurance, and so on.
Letters with new rental contracts are received in Ostravska in mailboxes by most tenants of a total of 44,000 RPG portfolios around mid-November.
RPG Apartments in their letters suggest an increase in rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special transfer to new rentals was opened at the customer centre on 18 November.
"It's running over a week, so it's just in the race," the workers respond after a moment of swing when the customer presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are local exciting themes.
Before the elections, he was taken by the Vice-President of Parliament and the island relative Lubomír Zaorálek from ČSSD, and even now he is filled with local newspapers.
"I want a new floor after twenty years."
"They didn't change my toilet board either," says the man mentioned in the introduction.
Most of the time, employees come to see if they can get a discount if they sign the RPG in the special offer.
A half-life discount on February rent will also be received by other tenants who will sign the new contract by 15 December.
The "deregulation" of the Haverjowsk crossing, but the questions are definitely not paid.
"From the 360 customers yesterday for the 2011 lease, there were only about forty to fifty people," workers estimate for overtime.
The RPG, however, proposes individual meetings on the web and its walls where it will be needed.
However, if both parties do not agree to rent, they will have to be appointed by an independent court.
"It is not about threats, but about information about the only possible and legitimate legal procedure," the RPG points out on its pages.
"No one will be tried here," thinks one of the employees of the RPG Byty and the man on the street before the client center gives her a partial truth.
"I have 13 thousand pensions and I have five thousand left for food, I don't have to judge," he says.
But the worker's going to go back, but he's just gonna make it worse.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media that they don't sign, so people are probably waiting," he thinks.
The rental regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with New Year 2011 and according to the RPG Byty, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing rental is still not enough for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," says Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, who is just angry with the tenant, says homeowners are the main reason for the increase in rent.
In the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG could invest four billion in apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling against the powdered seat of the Haverjov waiting room so far repeats some redly highlighted information.
"The increase in rent in 2011 is 15% and less for 31 200 apartments, that's more than 90% of RPG."
"And it will always be more than 7,50 Kč per square metre and month," appears on the screen.
Only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio will be rented by 38%.
"In these cases there is an increase from an extremely low amount of 19,66 Kč per square metre," the RPG points out.
2600 apartments will remain the same for the next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation is not paid by jump, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another obligation: all the money from the increase in rent (see chart) gives the company back to the apartments, mainly to the heat savings - new windows and heating.
They're primarily supposed to get people who sign a lease agreement.
The office also includes a school, understood the architects
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new residence of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to hide a miniskirt with everything that belongs to it - with colorful walls, fancy furniture, a toy shop and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch employees can visit her.
Arch.Design, from which the workshops took up a number of important Brno buildings, calculated with space for its company miniskik since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
Because it employs almost 90 people mostly at the age of babyboom and it was her concern that women designers and architects could return to work quickly.
Together with the options for short-term benefits, Arch.Design offers its employees under the social programme.
So builders and architects have the opportunity to create a demanding job with child care.
The Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs has been able to receive the grant of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs with the support of their leadership.
The company mine is financed from the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme of Human Resources and Employment and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the grant funding (a grant of CZK 2, 8 million) they could purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified personnel and operations for a period of two years.
After a financial grant has been exhausted (2 years) Arch.Design has a duty to operate a mine at its own cost for 3 years.
The preparation of the project lasted for one year and with the application for a grant significantly helped Economy Rating.
Peči provides qualified staff, keeps a nurse and an MSH teacher on a daily basis, so children can go to school without an age limit, although most of them are 3 years old.
Because it's a mini-school, at the moment there can be only 5 children, but more can be created during the day.
School running is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use school regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the minischool is comparable to the pre-school framework.
Children are not only playing here, but they are also provided with quality training - from basic knowledge to preparation for school lessons, English is also being taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, exciting games, but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and drop stress situations with late raising children from schools away from their parents’ workplace.
Parents use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that there is a naturally loyal relationship between an employee and an employer.
Arch.Design has thus arranged for Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees are friends to the family and through this program has enhanced personal marketing.
The house from the bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look at the interiors from Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of the old oak tree, the staircase reminds of five dinosaurs, and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the local houses, thanks to its organic forms, he earned a name for the House from the bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, pieces of bricks and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of sheds and all-embracing soft curves, all of this is typical for the session of Antoni Gaudí.
The front door opens the dream lines, soft colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
In detail, you can see geometry, rhythm, and exactly the right order.
The whole facade at home sounds even more dramatic in the night, it is illuminated so that the impression of light of colors is even strengthened.
Guilty and shape bending appear to the same extent in the interior.
The wood in the waves duplicates fine frames, curtains, beautiful elements of the door, hooks and leaves.
The house of Batlló, located in the Eixample district on the moving shopping street Passeig de Gràcia n. 43, was rebuilt in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortesse.
The reconstruction took place two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on rescuing the old building and building completely new, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea of unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The house of Casa Batllo but Antoni Gaudí did not propose it on his own.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was on its design floor that decorations were made for the property owners and the use of mosaics on the facade.
A number of other artists and artists worked on the facade.
The joint work on the proposals of Casa Batlló started successfully with Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's house Casa Mila and the Güell Park, where there are other Gaudi's works.
From the local house of burial he served after finishing thanks to his organic forms of the nickname "House of bones".
Others called him "a living house" because of the specific mechanism of opening windows.
It is also said that on the top of the building there is a sword of St. Jiri, patron of Catalan.
Hidden religious motives also include other social building elements.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system with wind currents and typical fireplaces for his time.
The Bizarne may appear their forty-five degrees.
When making Gaudí, he absolutely did not respect the construction regulations at that time and did not allow them to be bound.
At the beginning of the building, however, the construction permit was obtained from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so heavy that two years later the city council was threatened and asked for repair.
For example, the Council ruled that the building had also affected the pillars of the public corridor.
There was never a fix, but only fifteen days after the city’s call, Josep Batlló requested permission to rent two of the highest floors of the building.
The owner moved himself into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a public living room and in the third floor of the apartment and a private part of the apartment.
The land was rented by the priesthood.
The whole six-storey house is an old staircase that can be stepped up to the roof terrace itself.
The main elements of the conversion were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the hall doors and the larger company can communicate comfortably together without at the same time maintaining the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facades, Gaudí's house also received non-traditional shocks and two more.
Gaudí's game is also impressive with light, blue and white-glazed tiles covered in the inner courtyard, and lamps.
Game two colors provides maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was easy to put on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which the sun’s light on the other side absorbs.
The House of Casa Batlló, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and proudest apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to take this step until 2002, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They stayed at the tour because they found out that it was a very useful company and they also expanded the tour into common and underground spaces, including roof terraces.
Entry into the memory is certainly not negligible, making 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist licenses have a 20% discount.
Suma significantly exceeds the price of entry into other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the right atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you need to quickly complicate with one of the people in the kitchen and visit it directly at home.
How to choose mattresses and vegetables: women have requirements other than men
Not a desirable bed frame, but the quality of the bed area, i.e. mattresses and vegetables, provide the basis for a really good bed.
However, it must be harmoniously supplemented to meet the specific user.
In choosing, he decides a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health status and sex of the owners.
It's also important for the type of interior where mattresses and grass are cut.
Typical example?
Maybe on weekends, where it doesn't melt regularly, latex mattresses are not suitable because they're slowly "heating up".
In addition, they have significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
Then it is necessary to turn around regularly.
Because if they don't have a lot of ventilating channels in the core, and they're still on a solid floor, they're keeping moisture: it could also show up under them.
He also decides on his choice.
Anyone who has spent a longer time abroad, where many high mattresses are often used with a soft layer, will find it difficult to feel good on a low and hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they wouldn't sleep here."
"On their thin shoulders, legs and sides they needed mattresses with a soft layer of foam."
"They may also be recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misbehave "information" from the hips and skin," explains Sylvia Hadamkíková, who specializes in the well-known furniture.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, were therefore caught up with a line of foam years ago.
"Today it's okay, the appropriate mattress has Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a fighter from the NHL to evaluate a penny line.
This "miraculous" works easily.
Optimise your fat and shape according to absorbed heat or adjust to your warm body.
You're not going to get hurt. You're not going to turn around at night like you're going to have a hard fight.
Just sleep better.
Line foam also works as a protection against protrusions.
When selecting the size of the mattress to your height, add another length of the foot, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women with a height of about 180 cm thus need bed 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm in double, then 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example for singles, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For a comfortable and possible visit.
"In other words, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back you should have your hands gently crossed in the lap," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the expert expert of Chechnya and decorators, who has been devoted to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomic furniture for a number of years and is teaching it at professional schools.
In the doubles, each individual needs its own growth and mattresses, but here's the shopping attention to sweeten the mattresses.
Otherwise there'll be nothing else but mounting vegetables up to different heights, but you don't have to do it in every frame of bed.
The foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring basket of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters should be counted on the forming and cylindrical layer.
"If you touch your hand or reach on your mattress, you mustn't feel the spring," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grill.
The whole bed, when the mattresses and the floor are like a raised Siamese twins, don't have anything to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are windy, they can't wash their pots, which is already common today.
And since we usually get 0.2 to 0.75 litres per night, it is clear that after five to seven years of mattressing, one large (and closed) net begins to be remembered.
That's why experts refuse advertising slogans about the life of mattresses up to 25 years, or even life assurances.
But everything has its own butt.
Therefore, advice from the sellers practice: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work, do not give up a recording cover, but add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattresses are usually produced today throughout the circuit, so after the break-up we get two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine very important!), however, manipulation in larger types (and in one person) may remind you of a combination of light weight in the ring with difficulty.
Do you have a solid board in your bed instead of a grill?
Never!
Maximum on the bed for one night visits.
However, guard the board (if no longer available) with wind openings and use a mattress with a spring rib and a height of at least 15 cm with bags (with it.Taschenfederkern) and a cypress layer.
Polyurethane mattresses on such a base do not belong.
On non-relative lamela herbs 14 to 18 lamelam will be suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (needed to combine latex and coconut), but you will always be paid more lamela, 28 and more where lamela are in the area of beer double and it is possible to regulate their density.
There are no mattresses on the positioning of lamela beans, because they do not respond to the positioning.
In addition to the setting of the pelvis, the so-called shoulder valve can be added.
It's a special trapping of the blades that allows you to push, or even bend the blade so that the shoulder of the sleeper can be quite "lost".
For men who have "a shoulder across their back", it's definitely important.
They even remember the matrices manufacturers who started using the soft zone in the shoulder area.
They also remind women of the softer surfaces in the places of the hives.
For the most demanding customers there are cryel or cystic crusts with so-called multitortic springing.
The pressure breaks down to several points and decreases tension.
However, as soon as you use the correct mattress and crop wrong pillow (large and "inducted"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must support the head and tip only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can be released.
As a suitable size, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should equal the height of the shoulder (with the shoulder strap or a weakened area in the mattress).
Modern mattresses have nothing to do with original strawberries filled with grass.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least blends.
The trend was just at the prom.
Natural oils, such as hops and soybeans, are replaced by petroleum oils from which polyurethane foam is produced.
The soybean is used by all known producers.
"It was in mating means that the core is made of material of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vasiček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattresses, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also take microcaps to relax your fresh smell of wood or lavender.
There's also a division for men and women.
While a man "feels" a plant extract from the belly to absorb heat from the mattress and cool the body, the women are instead "toppy".
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, so it's a weaker sex.
Today's favorites?
The mattresses made of cold foam (has larger pores with damaged cellular structure, is so much more flexible than normal polyurethane and offers even better elasticity.
The combination of various shades of cold foam and "line" foam creates multi-zonal mattresses that know exactly where to be head, thigh and legs.
For quality mattresses you will pay from seven thousand crowns and higher.
Those who fulfil health parameters have a lower rate of VAT, are gated as health aid.
He was the first to achieve this advantage of Gumotex in the Czech Republic.
Saving on the mattress and grill is not easy.
Sometimes the need for action by producers or sellers offering two mattresses at the price of one can be used.
Maybe the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with all memory foam Memory in the tray for 11,990 crowns.
The other one can already be arranged free of charge.
The Eura line or viscoelastic foam with open cell structure and high density started with the "cosmic" tempo of Tempur material.
He was originally raised as a material for NASA because at the beginning astronauts were exposed to enormous overload.
The temperature in the heat softens, but the cold gets stronger.
The warm human body will adapt and release its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the creation of prosthetics, but also to increase comfort in sleeping.
Viscolelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special pillows under feet that relieve the legs and the digestive system.
The producers here use, for example, the foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and so on.
People's tracking devices want more parents to look after their children
The fear of your own child has brought more and more people to the idea of GPS surveillance.
The system that was originally designed to search for cars can also monitor the movement of people, thus helping in cases such as the disappearance of the nine - year - old Anička Janatkov.
The device is so far as big as a cheese box, but soon it can only be big as clocks.
A number of people were frightened by the missing Anički and began to beg for the means to protect their children better.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We're trying to tell everyone that it's not about spying, but about other means to reduce the likelihood that some tragedy will happen," says Peter Pilin of Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of monitoring equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that in a certain case it may lead to misuse of such devices, perhaps if they are given to someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't met with such a case."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how it is used in case of need.
Children's psychologist Dana Bočkova points out that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like that, he'll just get rid of it.
"And very small children show great creativity in how some things are allowed to lose when they don't want to be under control."
"The big expectations have been triggered earlier by mobile parents, however, which can be turned off as well as these tracking devices," Bockova says.
It also argues whether, in the event of an attack, such a device would really help.
"When it comes to the planned kidnapping, the perpetrator will almost always ensure that the child has no electronics that could betray his position."
"Now it's the phone."
"When they start expanding the tracking equipment, they will also search for them, because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In such a case, criminals will always be step forward in front of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it admits that a similar device may help in the event of an unexpected attack with pedophile.
According to Roberta Čecha of the company RC Monitoring, which offers monitoring services for both cars and persons, and in the event of an attack on the immediate destruction of the tracking device, its presence may help.
"The device may be set to regular dispatch of the position after a certain time has elapsed."
"If his damage occurs, at least the last position of the person concerned shall be available."
"The expensive devices have built-in and fitting meters, so even if a man just slipped and remained motionless, the device will send immediately warning with the event of the location," the Czech claims.
According to him, a similar service can also drive smart mobile phones with navigation, where you can only record special software.
The problem of current monitoring units is that it is either a device similar to the size of the box from sires or smaller mobile phones.
It's always such a threat to their loss.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, therefore, devices that look like normal digital clocks are now being tested.
"That will have the greatest advantage of not having to know the tracking device at all."
"Or she's known for some time and it can give the police more time," she adds.
Whether monitoring equipment is already developed in straps or trailers, they will still use the same technology used to monitor vehicles.
This is a combination of position detection through the GPS system (using normal autonavigation) and mobile phone function, which reports the current vehicle position.
The army has a fire hose to turn over the Czech Republic.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of wires that fire the market.
Last year, however, the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometres of wire to the funds.
The army's got 225-year-old supplies.
The problem is that the longevity of the rope is two, maximum four years.
The army bought fire chains from the action STV Group, a.k.a. for 40 million crowns.
The general staff, on the basis of the purchase of such a huge amount of MF DNA fuel, said that soldiers in training consume 60 kilometres of fuel each year.
However, from the military pyrotechnics that MF DENS referred to, it turns out that they would have to go through every year with very intensive pyrotechnic training, including all generals, army officers, secretaries or cleaners.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondr and Army Commander Vlastimil Pick are not exempt.
Only then would she be able to justify the annual consumption of the army 60 kilometers of firearms.
This length corresponds to 25 thousand explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's resources would last for more than ten years.
On the contrary, if it were to be paid that the basic training of each new professional is sufficient for a maximum of two metres of fuel liner, as experts say, the army has provided with a fresh purchase - even with increased consumption of female or special units - supplies for the said 225 years.
Soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade, however, have recently personally complained to Minister Vondro that they do not have nearly any handguns, so they are also limited due to the need for money.
There's no talk about the lack of underwear.
"It doesn't take so much of my head to buy from us so many fires over and over again."
"But it's their decision and they certainly know what they're going to do."
"For us, an army is a good customer, whom we as traders are trying to compensate," says the business manager STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek's speaking ministry of defence is reasoning hundreds of kilometers of purchased wires and that the army will have the stocks of this "municipal" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děký from the STV Group is only talking about four years of fire and police or military pyrotechnics for only two years.
"When perfect storage can be the four," says one of them, who as a soldier does not want to publish a name because of the criticism of the army.
After life has passed, each ammunition must carefully test whether it is still reliable and does not endanger soldiers in life.
However, these tests are not free and are worth more money.
Another argument of the Ministry is a multi-series discount of 445 kilometers of fuel lines.
"We were about sixty percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty kilometers," explains the spokesperson Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence's opinion.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of firefighting wires of police pyrotechnics, which are liquidating ammunition from World War II or after the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police are always ordering only so much that this munitions can be consumed before the end of life.
It has been proven to her for the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also be more flexible to obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of rope.
The Ministry of Defence already has considerable difficulties with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition since the Warsaw Treaty, when the two-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-s.
The Czech, according to the pyrotechnics that MF DENS referred to, is awaiting the same problem in a few years: it will eliminate hundreds of kilometres of old fires that "lasino" is buying today.
So far, I'm drawing from the contacts that I've won because of the competition
The winner's place in the competition The Year's Lifemaker helped Lukas Pytloun sell his hotel Francis.
The winner of last year's competition The Lifemaker of the Year became the 18th-year-old businessman Lukas Pytloun from Liberce.
His story of success is like a movie.
Lucas Pytlon loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price in Liberca.
Out of savings from foreign brigades and through bank loans, he bought a half-scene house with five apartments.
Since he was still a student of the third year of high school, it was a great courage.
"Then the ratio between the quality and the price of the accommodation with us did not allow me to try to do something about it," says Lukas Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment started renting foreign workers.
All profit invested back into the house, which gradually transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with total capacity over 300 beds in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was the recently four-star Pytloun design hotel.
But this year, he's got another, same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with the hotel in Ostrov at Tisse, where we sold our French concept and other interested people about the French hotels Pytloun reported," says last year's vivologist number one.
"And for this sale the license to operate the hotel was greatly divided by the victory in the competition of the Year Lifeline," Pytloun acknowledges.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberca and the surrounding area.
"People knew me on the streets, often congratulated me more and I have to say that it was nice," she recalls.
Participation in the competition certainly recommends to all who strive for something.
It's not even necessary to win. Every sighting is good.
He says he's still drawing from contacts and acquaintances that he might never have gotten to.
"With some of the competition I met, I started trading regularly."
The glory associated with success, according to him, has reached a little of every employee.
And that he's got about seventy.
"I see greater loyalty and pride in them to share in something that has gained general recognition."
"It's not far from my personal success, it's the result of good work for all of us together."
"Only my name is scattered to the front," humbly says Lukas Pytloun today.
I wish my successor a year calmer than we had at Farmet
The euphoria of victory quickly resolved the effects of the crisis.
But thanks to the goal of the winner, Farmet has worse times behind him.
For the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Company competition, the owner of Farmet, Karel Žjárský, arrived in the Slovenian house.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts he had made to build from a small tool shop in the Czech Skalica firm with stamilion facilities.
"I can say that appreciation has not only encouraged me, but all my colleagues and has increased our self-awareness for the fight against competition," said last year's winner.
At the beginning of Farm's history, it was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karl Jjárský's father to hire a small factory as a compensation for communists, he didn't weigh long, he refused his career in the company where he was working, and his dad and a few of his friends set up a company on plastic baths.
Soon thereafter, they began specializing in vegetable oil.
After eighteen years they became the largest producers of automated forests in Central Europe.
The company also gained greater awareness amongst the undisputed public after its success in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to notice the Farmet brand much better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they were working with the company that achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Jjárský.
Last year, however, he wasn't only in Farmet for euphoria from victory.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results by 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And in 2009, it was the most difficult year for the sale of machinery.
A crisis that has not yet affected the citizens, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and have begun to limit the purchases of new machinery and technology.
"Of course this situation has not escaped us."
"The markets fell by 40%, we had to limit production and even came to release," explains Karel Jjárský.
A viable company must sometimes be able to take such non-popular measures.
But the situation has been managed and the company has been profited, even if I'm less than before the crisis.
However, what they didn't do at Farmet is investment in research and development.
"With grants we have built a research and training centre, we have strengthened presentations at international fairs, we have won a major award at home exhibitions," Zjárský says.
It all shows that the crisis is behind them.
Markets are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Jjárský.
A survey that removes unreasonable rules
A survey of the Year's Absurdit is a fourth part of the business plan.
Some unwise rules have already succeeded in canceling.
An unfavorable winner of the next year's Absurdita survey became an obligation to hold documents that are also available to officials online.
She has decided more than a third of the four thousand voters.
For example, the management of social security required paper from the trade register, even though the official can get it by two clicks.
Thanks to the survey, it's changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require the registration of the trade register for checks on the insured person's payers," ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buranová said.
To shed light on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and those senseless to abolish are the meaning of the absurdity contest of the year.
This is already the fourth part of the business plan organised by the Economic News and among the public is looking forward to an ever-increasing turnout.
If the vote was attended by some three thousand voters, they were nearly four thousand in the year.
And there's no wonder, the most diverse legal obligations that serve only to keep business, we still have enough.
"We may be at the front of the world in the number of tax admission leaves," notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurships of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has become the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving in any way.
According to the World Bank, in terms of business conditions, the Czech Republic has placed itself at 74th position, which is about eight places up last year.
The Year's Absurdita competition was first announced in 2006 and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Admit administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can be applied to anyone every year from April to the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The website www.firmaroku.cz Then the competition editor selects seven candidates for "antique" and lets the public vote on it in October via the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes of the winners.
More than a hundred, more than 105 regulations and regulations have been registered in the survey this year.
The guys sent businessmen, but also professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, between the appointed ocials, is a requirement for cars to be used for the maintenance of motorways and motorways, or for entrepreneurs to paint with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of proposals this year is published on the competition pages.
The declaration of competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November at the Václav Square in Prague, is part of an opening which is regularly involved in political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurships of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Economics of the Czech Republic, assisted this competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot function where the state throws the bricks under the feet of businessmen, so my aim is to cancel every year at least three tenths of the paragraphs that are just too complicated today," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
An attempt to break the unreasonable regulation is not empty.
In 2007, people were most obliged to report to the company three days in advance of the establishment of a permanent establishment, the intention to go with the stand on the exhibition or tour.
This obligation has been removed by a new life law.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was announced by the Office of Labour for its foreign staff on a service trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
And a third of everything good.
An absurd regulation for physiotherapists was adopted in 2009 with a large mirror, refrigerator and two inflatable weights.
This was moderated by the Ministry of Health's announcement this year - the obligation to have a refrigerator has dropped.
The new category assesses joint-responsible companies
Assessment of environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
This year's fifth year's competition for Economic News is a category called the Responsible Company 2010.
The mission of this competition is to support a reasonable and fair business.
"This is how we want to support companies that take into account the impacts of their business on the environment and support community-responsive activities," says Patrick Bartholda, regional manager of a mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the declarer and guarantor of the competition as well as in the case of a year's rebellion.
To this year's first year this special subcategory of Vodafone Company's main competition in 2010, companies for which there is no success in its only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be published on its own.
Although the subject matter of its activities varies from one to the other in diameter, their efforts can be regarded as support and consideration by the common nominees.
In one case, for example, people with disabilities and elsewhere need personal problems or health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen full-republic finalists, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the company in charge of Pardubic is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the funding fund of the disabled children for seventeen years.
Again, about his poor health staff, an old paper from Poddebrad, which has more than 70 per cent of them, was awarded the title of the responsible company of the Central Czech Republic and was placed in the country as a third in the Vodafone Company year's competition.
In Olomouck, MiRyz Soft, the accountant, who introduced a flexible working time, also won a reduction of an average of 35 hours per week, but without a moderate reduction in pay.
Its title was also awarded by the jury for its preferred purchase from Czech producers, supporting civil activities in the near environment and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our businesses and our administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Mr. Milosze Riznar.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from Ústecký rethinks the health of its employees and has arranged ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each notebook, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided locally protected work in its corporate activities.
"In addition, we support the funding of the Man in the press, which helps specifically the local Roma community," says the representative of Ondřij Suchý.
In the last row, it is also worth mentioning the activities of the Prany and Cleaning company from the state of Karlovarian, which contributes to their pension insurance to its employees in the form of over-standard bonuses.
"We are again making contributions to food, transport, qualification and recreation," says Josef Strapác of the Bruntal construction company Czasch, the winner of Moravskosleskie region.
The responsible company of the year was automatically registered by all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the year who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the editor by 15 August at the latest.
The incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the author.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, the competitions could not be attended by the company responsible for the year, but were not disqualified from the "main" competition of the Vodafone Company for the year."
"It is not possible to apply only to this competition because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Company year," explains Karel Goldman from the Bison & Rose publishing agency.
At the Land Fund in Plšna Police caught up in public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plšna, anti-corruption police were arrested last day.
The railway detectives planted a local business in the media and a real-life dealer named Luboši G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the current public competition to settle the claims so that the land offered in the competition would be acquired by a particular interested party.
That's what Lubosh G. was supposed to pay half a million crowns for.
"To the contrary, I can only confirm that the police are suing one person for the breach of the pleas in the public contract and in the public competition," said Plenary's Chief of State, Antonie Zelena, who said that further details in view of the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
Forty-four-year-old businessman was released after 24 hours.
The way in which public competition could have been affected can only be said to be speculative in view of the minimum level of official information.
The spokesperson of the Lubomíra Black Land Fund on the Law question said that at a separate workshop in Plšna, policemen were actually arrested during the public competition.
"It was about a client, not our employee," she said.
The public competition has according to the Black correct title "The call for tenders for transfer of land under the land law" and is made where the proposed land is interested in more eligible applicants.
"These persons, within the framework of the challenge, offer a higher value of their refund claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"In accordance with the tenders offered, the order of the purchasers shall be determined and the Land Fund shall then transfer the land to the person offering the highest claims," the spokesperson explained.
Orboš G. apparently had information about the applicant and because he is also a legitimate person, because he has collected a number of refund claims, offered the interested parties the ground that the competition is not taking part.
He's obviously incapacitated for that.
That would explain that he had so much money in his custody.
Luboš G. has had over-standard PF contacts in the past.
He was a figure in the case of former Chief PF Václav Sankot, who was criminally charged for issuing in a refund of the land on which a decision had already been issued on the location of the building.
At that time, Luboš G. received from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the entry magistrates were to be built into the industrial zone of Borská field.
Later he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate behind the house in the very historic center of the city, which had much higher value.
Then she had to join the council because otherwise, by blocking the land, she would endanger the building.
Households pay hundreds per month
Homes will have to pay from January not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and cattle, heat supplies and some kind of growth and rent.
So families will have to pull out of their pockets from January to hundreds of crowns a month more than now.
The electricity will yield up to 4.6 percent, the gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, while in some cities you will have to pay for water supplies and many will also generate central heat supplies.
Electric radiation should be carried out annually by households in apartments rather than now.
However, the prices of electricity have decreased by all main suppliers, so there is a significant increase in energy production support from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics.
The gas, however, is little, but at a time when people melt the most and have the highest consumption.
So every year it has to also count with hundreds of crowns.
While electricity and gas flow throughout the Republic, changes in central heating prices vary from place to place.
Price increases are mainly planned by a larger municipality.
For example, the home in Pardubic or Hradci Králové will pay from January for central heating about 50 kroner a month, more than 1000 kroner will pay the family in Liberca annually.
The people of Prague are again threatened with more than 9 per cent of water and livestock, and if the city is to increase rent from infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Prawn will pay 6.8 per cent.
However, the price in Prague will continue to be lower in the whole of the Republic.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are now among the highest, it has a watery and stocky demand of 7.4 percent.
For example, they can increase the rent price in 450 thousand rental apartments, where the regulation ends from January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which in Ústí nad Labem owns about 2500 apartments, intends to increase rent by up to a hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new amount of rent are going to bring the company to court.
Regular rents paid by people in about 300 thousand apartments could grow by up to ten percent next year.
Czech children drink fernet and rum. Beer is fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptional and better brand of whiskey stolen by parents.
These are drinks that end up most often in the care of doctors who have been drunk for 15 years.
The exception is not children who are treated from the monkey in the hospital repeatedly.
This comes from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases at the children’s hospital ward’s income.
"Some beer or wine is completely uncoinned, because it takes a long time for you to drink."
"Trend is certainly a hard alcohol," said the law prime minister of the Children's Department Nemocnice Horovice in central Czech Republic Luděk Pelikán.
"If they can pull a bottle out of the box, it's about whiskey, but it's about fernet and vodka."
"The water has the advantage of getting into the juice and not feeling so much of it," explained the prime minister.
And for the truth, he's also the spokesperson of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurin.
"The most common is fernet or rum."
"It's modern alcohol today, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases it was about the slavovice they brought from home," said Jurin.
According to the primary Pelican, thirteen or fourteen years of drinking at hospital intake are relatively common.
He worked for ten years at a pediatrician in Motola, where the sanitizers are tied by trained schoolchildren from a wide range of backgrounds.
"One girl was lying with us about four times."
"The career began in twelve years when she was brought to us with 3.5 pounds of alcohol in the blood plus in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition in Holesovice at some dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't come at all strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," he said.
It is not the parents ’ concern or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring that is considered the main cause of growing child alcoholism.
However, according to experts, children do not have to talk about their legal dependence.
"Under the name of an alcoholic, several chronic alcohol addictions with all the phenomena that belong to them are understood, and that is not for children."
"For those who drink over and over again, there is a more symptomatic family-social background," explains Prime Minister Pelicán.
According to lecturer Jurin this year at a pediatric clinic in Motole, approximately forty children were hospitalized in mid-November.
However, only those with severe poisoning that had to stay in the hospital will get to the statistics.
Children drinkers who take their parents after an outpatient treatment may be at home transporting the police, they don't count at all.
In addition to cases where children just sit around the school and drink a bottle of chicken, according to Pelicán, there are three seasonal exercises that can be relied on: witches, Silvestr and the end of the school year.
"It's either they're sorry about the wrong statement, or they're celebrating the beginning of the holidays."
"However, at the witch's office, I was able to receive seven children's drinks all at once," said Pelikán.
The drink that spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically in favour of the one who suffers from unpleasant cocoon at home on the second day.
Early headache caused by dehydration and lack of glucose will result in an induction infusion of glucose and the missing organisms.
"They're actually better at it, because they have a good night's experience after that and good awakening and nothing's wrong."
"They're just confused about where they are," Pelicán admitted, saying that sometimes they would lose the pleasure of the patients at least by the cost that their treatment required.
Sanitation and hospitalization on the emergency bed will also result in tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as an educational tool, when I calculated on the visit to those children how much their alcohol was spent, and that they could also spend the whole year on the brigade to make up for that one party," Pelikán added.
However, according to him, the health insurance system is a regressive procedure in which parents would incur treatment costs that are not available to children’s drinkers.
Two L-159 flights are the first in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 flights from the total five pieces for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged the Casa C-295M flight, flew to the Spanish Seville on Tuesday, where the Casa - EADS aircraft manufacturer lives.
It's the first thing that machines of this kind have come into existence in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
In a foreign country, they've only been practicing or teaching years.
It's a two-way version of L-159T1, which has been operated by the Czech army and which have been aeronautical.
The remaining three machines are one-stop L-159.
They are still law-enforced in the Aeru Vodochoda and the broker of trade - Omnipol - has taken over last week.
When the airplanes are physically transported from Waterford, it is not known according to Jan Pejška from the Defence Press Committee.
"The only L-159 flights for the exchange were decommissioned from the long term of the saved flights, without any other deposits and investments from the Ministry's resort."
"Two-room L-159T1 were changed in the current state and form," said the Law of Pejšek.
He added that an army with no two-seat aircraft will not remain because in May 2009, the Ministry signed a 200 million crown contract with Aer Waterford to convert four non-necessary L-159 machines into two two-seat machines.
One new plane took over the army in July, the other by the end of this year.
According to Pejska, EADS has committed itself to deploying aircraft into the arms of some alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that the L-159 air carrier is EADS and will serve to train NATO pilots."
"It is therefore the things of the receiver, how this thing will be realized," Pejšek said.
According to the press, the Spanish army, for example, has no interest in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for one flight Casa and the purchase of three more flights for 3.5 billion crowns approved by the Mirka Topolánka government last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not sign up for the purchase of the selection procedure and addressed directly to EADS.
The then defence leadership argued that the exchange would support future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and used only 24, the rest of them would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa's aircraft is likely to have a court decision.
The European Commission, the Czech Ministry of Defence, complained to the European Court of Justice about the fact that the aircraft were to be selected on the basis of a whole European trend and not by a single producer.
The army has already taken over three of Casa's flights, the last one should be at Kbely's Prague airport within fourteen days.
Longer indicator than ring means lower risk of cancer
Men who have a marker longer than a ring are exposed to a lower risk of cancer from prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion to the study published by the British journal Cancer.
It can relate to the level of male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60 years," said a co-author of the study Ros Eeles, professor of cancer research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other dangerous factors such as family health, Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time more than three thousand healthy men were monitored by colleagues in Britain.
More than half of the participants in the study had a right-hand indicator shorter than a ring.
She paid for them the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
In the case of those who had a pointer longer than a ring, however, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent, and for men up to sixty, it was reduced by up to 87 per cent.
The ratio of the length of the two said fingers - made during the prenatal period - is likely to reflect the different levels of sex hormones that the child is exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous studies have shown that testosterone is just supporting the growing cancer of prostate.
The former Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Pačes told the ČTK that he knows about this study by chance, but he does not seem to know that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer would be "completely proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered with snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and on the walkways lies mostly eaten snow, roadmen in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway between 89 and 93 kilometres in the direction of the Razvadov is closed in the morning due to several accidents of freight and passenger cars and also stands at the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
The dispatcher of the Central Motor Club (UAMK) said so on the news.
At 91 kilometers there was a truck crash, at 93 kilometers two trucks hit, an accident caused by an accident.
Several personal cars also ended up in the suburbs.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway to 185 kilometers towards Prague.
There were two trucks down there.
Drivers should ride close to Brno at 190 km or cross Brno and then drive at 182 km on Kývalce.
There are several kilometres of columns.
There's also an accident on the D11 motorway, which is immediately upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a few centimeters of snow, the temperature measures show minus seven degrees of Celsia.
For example, the cars are built on Prosek, which is also störboholsk.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Tramvaje is running late, for example, on the track between Karl Square and Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis team is to be resealed.
There are also problems with railways and airports.
The Czech roads already had to cancel seven fast connections because of the snow.
For example, there are problems from Prague to Kralop or from Prague to Berun.
Passengers should control the current situation.
Rusin Airport was closed from 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most of the roads to South Moravia are already starved, but only with increased caution.
On Vyškovsk there are three roadways inaccessible, in Brno there are snow-like places and in Blanensk there are some communications needed in the above-mentioned snow-chained areas.
Among the most deprived were Vyškovska.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Milesovice.
They're gonna have to put the hair on.
When they're done, they can't be estimated.
There's a need to take care of the White Carpathians in Hodoninsk.
On roads that are maintained only by inert suction for nature protection, it is up to five centimeters of snow, the ČTK said.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of snow, it fell most in the northern Czech Republic, many to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravskoslez region, about five inches [15 cm] of snow was attacked.
The snow is gradually rising in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "wise weapon"
The U.S. Army has launched a new "wise" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the code name XM-25.
Generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the dark conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is something like a little super-precious work.
Its projectiles lead to a laser with accuracy of several meters.
Special rounds of 25 mm diameter, developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive market, actually work as small grenades.
Wars can be programmed so that they explode not only when they attack the target, but at any point their ballistic routes.
It is therefore possible to use them against an enemy who is hiding behind a barrier, a wall or a pit.
Because Shora is usually not protected, and when a deadly rain falls on it, it can be removed from the battle.
According to Richard Audetta, who participated in the development of XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for bagging using "wise" technology.
"The soldier basically acts in such a way that he finds a target, sends a laser beam to him, which determines the distance, so he gets a precise target point, according to him adjusts the measure and pushes the trigger."
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"When you press the gun, the gun will be loaded and fired at the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
Moved by 400 jobs
The Fujits Group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees move their jobs in July next year from today's administrative building to the Marienbader-major in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
Japan's Fujits Group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant in the field specialized in computers and their maintenance reported on Wednesday, 400 men and women moved their jobs from the current administrative building in Marienbader-station in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyons Street, in the part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the statement by Mr Fujist, there should be another 100 working places of the group that are currently divided into the region at the appropriate time.
The rental offer was just very attractive and large-space offices in Astro Park are more suited to the work of employees.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujits was just renting.
Competent Officer Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central seat with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is just as important to global society as Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointments to the defeated.
The leading economic rapporteur in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that this was successful in obtaining a "global player".
It's "a fantastic expression of trust in this locality."
Fujitsu is heading for the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Mayor Bad Homburg, Michael Korwis (Green), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
It was only in time that the city was informed by the company's management of its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to companies," said Korwis.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the problems of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the real estate at the Marienbader Square.
As a result, there were decisive economic reasons.
Now it's about preventing a long stay in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The house at the Rathaus complex, which was still used by Fujits, and the neighboring "Kleine Verticale" belonged ten years ago together with other buildings at the Marienbader complex to the most discussed construction purposes of the spa city.
Between the stations and the councils there was a joint project of the city and a private projector called the city entrance, which was criticised for the massive construction of areas that had previously served as a parking lot and at the same time for the height of buildings.
In 2001, Feri, the software manufacturer of travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujits computer manufacturer, was moved into the home.
The buildings that were used by Fujitsu in 2006 together with Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund were sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu Group from Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it offers computers and servers available and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the area of Ryn and Mohan is one of the largest in Germany, but the largest employees in Fujits is in Munich.
From Bad Homburg he is moving to Frankfurt-Niederrad, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, another subsidiary of Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
At the Astro Park administrative building, it was rented for this purpose of 7,000 square metres.
In the complex - its name points to the starry landscape, which is twenty years old, which is also inhabited by the central link between the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon turn off server - threats against Assangem
Wikileaks gets into tights.
The Amazon Internet Service has switched off on its detection platform servers.
It is possible that this has happened to political pressure after the publication of secret diplomatic depositors.
Founder Wikileaks Assange is allegedly held in Great Britain.
Wikileaks, a platform for discovery, is getting under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their current home server in America and are now searching for a home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is led to the list of Interpols, is to be held according to a newspaper contribution in the United Kingdom.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free expression in the country of the free," activists announced short Twitter news service on Wednesday (local time).
The Amazon Internet company recently downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used to publish secret diplomatic records of the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to manage a high number of accesses to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained this step: "Okay - our dollars are now losing by hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators conducted the survey, published the CNN television station on the basis of information from the Lieberman office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened Amazon boycott, informed the British "Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to join this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks," said the senator.
In the meantime, Lieberman called for a ban on the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks is one of the illegal, indiscriminate and indiscriminately, and this puts our national security at risk and threatens life on the planet," said a statement by the non-sanctionary senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand stolen material."
The founder Wikileaks Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities for suspected rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
Based on a report in London's newspaper "The Independent", a 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
Internet activist has always marked an investigation in Sweden for the intrigues of his opponents.
Speaking Wikileaks Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"Even there were calls for Julian Assange's murder."
That's why Assange is afraid of his own security, Hrafnsson said.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks will still be hiding.
Hrafnsson was obviously reacting to statements from North America.
In America, former governor of the Republic of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked that she be responsible for publishing Wikileaks for treason.
In Canada, he said on television that one of the leaders of the government, Stephen Harper, was ironically, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use "target plane".
Meanwhile, the White House and Assange were torn apart.
US President Barack Obama's speech, Robert Gibbs, called it "silly and absurd", that Assange asked for the resignation of foreign minister Hillary Clinton, if he was responsible for the recently published spying challenges to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with websites," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now examining the security of its databases.
The Special Representative was appointed representative of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Action, Russell Travers, informed the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of "necessary reforms in the structure", which are necessary after publishing messages from the mission to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine ways in which the entire government is exchanging and protecting information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they should get into danger due to the publication of Wikileaks.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them, if it's necessary."
Frozen University
At "Gelato University" in Bologna, frozen sugars are being prepared for a better annual period.
The basic course for future freezers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where's the ice cream actually taken?
From Gelatier and Gelataio.
Gelatier, the Czech a little old freezer, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream.
Gelataio throws ice cream out of the refrigerator box, puts it into charge and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to find out more about the ice cream, he won't miss the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the manufacturer of ice-cream ice-cream machines set up an ice-cream university so that the ice-cream from its machines would meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
But it also offers several special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in its own freezer.
Someone wants to pursue a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, another dares to see the thin ice of their vague complaints.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries throughout the world - from Brazil across Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of Ice-Cream industry in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians are dreaming that they're opening a freezer in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman came home to Julia because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to participants the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
The decision-maker is not only a good taste, but also a generous haze and a good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training at the southern and proprietary pancake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it still has a necessary dose of romance."
The first step in production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserts basic premixtures of milk, butter, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large blender that heats everything by electronic program to 85 degrees and then immediately cools down to four degrees.
Then it turns on the machine with the chicken and comes out of the pasteurised white basic cream, the basis of all kinds of milk freezes.
Immediately the teacher is asleep with questions: Is it possible to produce ice cream only from natural substances without stabiliser?
How can a person experiment on his own?
Luciano warns you to let the spirit of the times go into the unknown.
Who is talking about ice cream "only from natural vegetables", apparently also used stabilisers - most natural products such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to produce ice cream even without stabilisers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will hit and the customer will have the ice grain itself.
Certain variations of the basic material are permitted.
It'll be more stressful with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the candy department.
Besides, there are powders and creams.
"The suppliers will try to force a lot of aromatized dishes."
"But you should just experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or they freeze from a white basic substance that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa into a base for a variety of chocolate experiments.
Now he's allowed to participate in the ice-cream course.
Luciano is allowed to produce always four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and liscoorice ice creams - either with eggs or without them in basic material, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural dishes.
The same experiment shall also be carried out with fruit species.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pyrene - since taste is not always better.
Liscoorice ice cream does not have to taste more ores when it contains more ores.
The most popular ice cream from the kiwi is produced by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Only after the balanced mixture lifts the proper taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely computational task: If broccoli pepper is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe.
There's a need for extra sugar in citric ice cream.
Luciano emits a device to determine the sugar content of the fruit (vinekeepers measure the grape must).
Luckily, the tables make numbers easier.
The production of ice cream does not require as much body moisture as it used to.
It does not only help the device for the automatic production of the basic material.
There is also a device that combines the finished ice cream mixture into the cream at the same time and cools down the temperature.
Despite all the automation, we don't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will poison himself and his colleagues to the bottom of the fruit pear when he gets out of control by a huge mixer.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time when something like this happens."
Reviewers in double light
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is linked to an industry that is experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation is now expressed by a group of experts from Test Biotech, who are considered to be an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a hell of a theory, but we've documented it well," Testbiotech Christoph Then said on Wednesday.
The main groups of experts from the EFSA for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other experts from the EFSA, have been in agreement with the lobbyists of Ilsi for several years.
This is funded by groups like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in the EFSA's control regulations for genetic plants and is thus in a clear focus of interest, says Then.
The regulations of Ephesus are in full agreement with the documents of Ilsi and are such as to carry a handwriting of the industry which should be controlled by the Italian Parliament.
It's already the second thing the Testbiots point to.
Recently, a senior manager from Ephesus, without any additions or a transitional period, moved to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - which changed the parties.
The announcement for Central Germany (MDR) has also recently revealed the EU Industrial Lobby Control Office's personal connection, which has aroused interest both in the Ministry of the Environment and EU Members.
In the meantime, Efs can't identify the conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, i.e. those from industry, where they are highly skilled, is listed in one statement.
Experts working for Ephesus are not required to have any contact with industry.
But he has to report them.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is only designated as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - except for the assessment of risks biotechnologies without contract lobbyists.
Independent experts such as Then criticise that at present genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any feeding attempt, and that the response of genetic plants to the effects of the environment does not occur.
"We want to know what, for example, will do genetically modified corn on the field," says Then.
The current practice is just to test isolated proteins, not the entire genetic plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If they're not looking for a risk, how would it be possible to find it?"
And Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The scientific workshop has been examining genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical High School in Curych.
In this area industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe as well as in the United States.
That's why there are almost no scientists who wouldn't be connected to the group anymore.
Most studies are not published that are critical for companies.
"Industry controls security research," Hilbeck says.
Stone level
Uli Gsell also ordered some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he stood in front of the station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It's snowing.
I know the story: In September the bags came and began to cook a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands demonstrated against S21, a billion-dollar reduction.
When the building was stopped, most of the wings were in tears.
Breaked into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
A warrior from Crailsheim, a soft, rough stone used in the years 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a member of the Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
He secured some of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He can't go away."
It spreads out: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and original."
When one cut, he smelled like a cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what to do with those pieces yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The stone foot from Stuttgart leads to the forest at Tübingen at the former deposit of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone kingdom.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought all the things that came up during the raid in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they broke into a barn or disappeared into a deposit," he says in his office, a wooden building that was a former watchhouse.
They told him that they were giving him and threatening him when in September in all the newspapers it was that he bought the remains of the north wing from a society that is carrying out a democracy.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he couldn't even be a demon.
And if that happens, then it's more reasonable when the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21 opponents each about 80 kilograms of heavy block, price for about 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also hope that he will return to the reconstruction.
Rongen bought 500 tonnes, loaded 25 large trucks.
Probably half of it's still in the woods, the rest of it's been sold a long time.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, building houses.
They came from all corners and pulled what went into the trunk and the trailer.
The stones of the Stuttgart dispute have long been turned into "walls" or as edges with herbs.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political belt."
He sits in his field car and goes for a ride after his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied before the law, interrupted the study, later biology, then took an interest in the computer and eventually became a stone dealer.
And a stone lover.
It has 40,000 tons of stones stored.
He's counting on his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer with old stones in the Republic.
Brave.
In the snow, there's an artist-made peacock.
"One of them belonged to the Marien Bridge in the Drajjjanes," he says.
The poet from Laba, yellow, hot, is excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're going on our way up through the woods.
It shows the crowd: a red peacock, the former part of the station in Karlsruhe.
Next.
"Beautiful travertine."
One of those paintings belonged to the Neckarstadion Tribune in Stuttgart.
There are stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt-travertine from the police president in Stuttgart, a red granite from the temple of Saint Blasien, a tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What a work, what a struggle, what a pot.
When Rongen is thinking about how the stones were broken by hand and transported by means of simple carts and carriages, he will become quite polite.
"It'd be a shame if something like this got blown up."
He didn't become rich, very rich at all.
A stone merchant today employs 14 people, and in addition, up in the woods there are stonemen, one carpenter, one tailor, one glass and one gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who assesses the remains.
At the appropriate time, he has to go to the Colin.
The stones will be saved there, too.
High-potential talent battle
There's a lot of people at the funeral.
16 students are pressed with salmon bread, tomato sauce and sweetness.
The technical university in Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students of engineering and design to the workshop.
Together with the VW developers here they are supposed to talk about the car of the future - and only by the way to get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to compete for the smartest heads, as well as the company VW, to succeed and bet on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible to recruit the most desperate graduates in the audiences, before they get to the labour market, they will be interested in others.
Since universities do not publish any list of the success of their students, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in practical-oriented projects and gain them.
At TU Braunschweig the car group is trying to get the talents on the second day.
One young lady from the private department delivers prescriptions, rubber bears and boards with a VW logo.
He will tell the hopeful young talent about practical programs, student jobs and indicate their way to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see the benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"The VW can get to know students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates, and think about who would be suitable as a collaborator."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is he's so openly fighting for students.
"Otherwise, it was a major professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors companies can no longer choose their employees from long-term representatives.
On the contrary, he must try and try to exert a particularly highly qualified workforce.
In particular, engineering graduates have an excellent negotiating position.
According to Germany’s Association of VDI Engineers, 40,000 engineering positions remained uninhabited in October.
And according to the VDI forecast, the lack of engineers will still grow.
The KPMG audit and consulting firm is headed by Roman Dykta for talent hunting.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-Events, such as KPMG-Race, a type of modern treasure race where participants must find their way to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the United States next year.
At the same time, participants can visit KPMG’s branches and get to know the company.
Before that, it will be decided in two rounds of choice who will participate.
Only Créme de la Créme from many interested people will fly to the United States.
In the struggle for High Potentials at universities they will be paid according to the more and more firm laws.
"We want our race to be different from the others."
"A simple trip to the beach was too little for us."
Looks like a Dykta talent hunter's lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all the participants like this last year."
"Some will soon finish the study and plan to get to work with us," he says.
In addition to direct contact on campus, SMEs are presenting classics on the labour market.
"We're trying to contact the graduates at the trade show."
"As in Intersolar," says Sith Stübe, head of the Solarworld Solar Technology manufacturer's personal department.
The company from Bonn employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stebe knows the problem with young workers.
Currently 35 posts are posted on the company's website.
"At the present time it's just hard to put free space."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact with professors at universities.
Solarworld collaborates with various high schools, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that we can do practice or write a diploma."
The solar specialist does not arrange any expensive advertising.
Instead, the company is trying to benefit from other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Many groups can't offer it often," says the head of the personal department of Stübe.
Looking for a job doesn't play a major role for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good treatment options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld hosted a study at the Institute of Great Place to Work 55th place among 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, employees are asked how they are satisfied with their work and working environment and follow the framework conditions of employees.
The head of the Personal Department of Stübe hopes that its location will bring points to the employees.
"I believe that stakeholders are especially informed about the external evaluations of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to see yourself as an attractive employer leads through his own employee," he says.
This is specifically called the Internal Employer Branding, i.e. the placement of an employer on the market within the framework of their own employees.
"The satisfaction of the employees is the best envoys."
When the company takes good care of its people and they identify themselves with the company, they will do their own advertising to their employer between friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a connection game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil gardens
Over the next few years, there will be no new oil garden in the Gulf of Mexico before the coast of the state of Florida.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - thereby nullifying earlier plans.
New gardens are still forbidden before the Atlantic coast.
Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar announced it on Wednesday.
The reason for the severe ban, which should be paid at least five years later, is the explosion on the garden tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Prior to this accident, which cost eleven employees their lives and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled the pressure on the opposition and industry of his will to allow new gardens in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
They are trying to reduce the dependence of the United States on supplies of oil from abroad.
To this day, it is not clear who is responsible for destroying the oil spill in the Gulf.
The focus of criticism is the British energy group BP, which is confronted with billions of requests.
The investigation committee entrusted by Obama should present the results during December.
In October, Minister Ken Salazar cancelled the rotation ban that he paid for the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil groups applied for new gardening purposes.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters from being prevented by more stringent controls and strict safety regulations.
At present, the control authority is basically reforming itself, which has warned itself of many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would abolish the lucrative option of tax evasion for oil and gas groups.
The industry is now openly warning that more stringent regulation is mainly reducing the volume of oil in the Gulf.
"The government plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the gas and oil industry," the results of the current research in the BDO consulting firm - even before the ban on turning on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance still complains about the uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what the regulation is changing."
Investments in new training projects are shifted to retirement - on the basis of growth.
The area of Ogoni burned
The water in the rivers is oily, it smells like pumping: billions of gallons of unique oils destroyed nature in the Ogoni area of Nigeria.
People live by stealing, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari thinks so.
"Don't fight," the journalist calms down the ecological activist: "Today you'll get enough oil before the lens."
37-year-old Nigerian was watching an attempt to photograph a boy who's floating in the chest with water that surrounds the bushes: the scene works in the waterfront with spirit colors almost to the beauty.
There's no way under the surface of a blue-brown oil spill.
She used to pick up enough shrimp here, tells Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetti River.
Meanwhile, the effluent of water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large quantity of oil fell into the vast wet area.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must fall for at least six hours to get to the waters where the fish are: the area of Ogoni, which is in the heart of the delta of the Niger River, belongs to one of the most troubled areas in the world.
The road along the river with mangrove dams with many side streams is just a significant whole range of bays.
The engine on the boat cooks instead of the light water with a bucket of cheese, and whoever sinks his hand into the water will pull out the oil fingers.
The roots of the mangroves are treated from the ground as black points of medicine, rarely leaves their leaves to hang sadly.
We are looking for the nest of birds that usually occur in wet areas: Once the engine is shut down on the boat, it spreads into the former paradise, where it smells like pumping, horrible silence.
"What's going on here is the ecological management of the war," says sadly Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health."
Compared to war, it's legitimate.
The area of settlement of Ogoni is a battlefield where it has been fighting for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first inhabitants of Europe were included here, where in the 1980s the first derogation was created with the later corrected writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, where the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for the employees.
To date, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while the whole area of the delta of the three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5000 training gardens and 7,000 kilometres of management more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in Ogoni are lying in the area of the ship, the situation is very unstable for the group.
Every few hundred meters of water is considered a steel structure like a bizarre statue: "Christmas trees", so they are called very gently the heads of the garden openings.
They're 50 years old, most of them to the sea.
Every moment such a head of the garden opens, reports Akpobari, and then flows the constant flow of oil into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres of oil flow into the delta in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil that flowed into the sea at Alaska during the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes over who is still responsible for the ongoing ecological disaster.
While Shell Group marks sabotage and organised oil theft by more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists speak of the ravaging heads of gardens and narrow conduct as the main cause.
Shell requires much less security regulations in Nigeria than is usual in the world, has appointed a group in 2008 US scientist Richard Steiner: Only the number of conduction disorders is "several times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks far away as a deserted, oil-polluted workshop under the broad sky, it is extracted from the mangroves of the character: they are completely nasty and to the neck of the oil.
Under one of many of the courts, which are partly linked by leadership, partly freely scattered across the country, fires: illegal little refinery.
The oil is heated in the court over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
It flows from the lead to the catch of gasoline, later cap at the end of the drive of kerosene and finally of oil.
This is how Michael and his four associates produce up to four judges a day for 300 litres: "We will earn 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The population of deltas are using the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil state in Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents euros per litre of oil can still be lost by illegal producers: because they have raw materials for free.
It comes from the "bunkers", who connect to management everywhere in the area of Ogoni: according to experts, the entire area of the delta of the Niger River is losing at least 16 million litres of oil per day.
But only a relatively small part of the provisionally stored raw material will be illegally exhausted: The largest share will be filled by organised criminal networks, to which the policies and high status of military representatives will also belong, in tankers, and sell it on the world market.
The debate whether the people and their attacks or the lax way of production caused the disaster is considered by Akpobari's activist to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not considered to be spectators and if they were not to destroy the vitality of fishermen, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, Ogoni's relationship with Shell is so corrupt that it only takes into account the departure of the group: "Perhaps other nations like the Chinese will show up as better."
Michael's gonna get upset.
"The highest time to disappear," says the evaporated manufacturer.
"Every moment soldiers can come."
If she finds a special military unit, they're not at risk of prison, but of a painful payout.
Also soldiers who come mostly from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to benefit from raw materials.
"Then the damn thing got our land in all respects to the bottom," Akpobari says.
Investigators discovered a dangerous construction error in engines A380
A380 clearly has a major safety problem.
Investigators have found a possible construction error that could lead to a "catastrophic engine crash" during a machine survey that was forced to stop.
The air carrier Qantas wants to complain about the engine manufacturer.
Travelers in the airbus of Qantas had apparently more luck at the beginning of November than has been known so far: the Australian Air Safety Authority found a large safety facility on the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations and now warns of a possible construction failure.
It may have serious consequences: on one oil compound, there could be cracks due to consumption, reported this Thursday in a published statement by the ATSB.
This reality could lead to a "accidental engine accident".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
They also include the airbus of Qantas, which had to land urgently in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British manufacturer of turbines.
It provided a justification for the case before the Australian Court of Justice in Sydney, which allows for further legal measures against this company.
The head of Qantas Alan Joyce said his company would claim compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released and the wearers were damaged.
Rolls-Royce identified the cause of the damage to oil burning.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be exchanged around the world.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with large aircraft equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, spokesperson for ATSB Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiencies were considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline left its fleet A380 weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa exchanged one A380 engine as a security measure.
Two patrol plane is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Total snow is causing chaos in transport
All of Germany in white: almost all of the country snowed overnight.
On many roads there are chaos, train and aircraft connections are broken.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter is cold Germany: almost the whole Republic fell on Thursday night at freezing temperatures with snow - leading in many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and east, it lies in some places up to 15 centimeters of snow.
On several roads and many roads there is a very limited transport.
At A7 at Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but it was not able to cope with the newly installed snow.
There was still a strong storm wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Baltic Sea Coast in Šlesvik-Holštínsk is expected to have a stormy flood in the morning with a water condition of 1.2 metres above normal.
The snowflakes in Saska caused major problems on roads and public roads.
According to the centre of the bad weather Meteomedia was therefore a degree of vial lightning in the Sasque Switzerland - at least the highest degree.
Part of it was 30 centimeters of new snow, strong and fresh winds caused the waves.
There were several freight and passenger cars left at night.
In Saska-Anhaltska, police authorities have also reported major road problems.
A2 caused the wind and snow to slow down and toss.
In Durynsk, there were problems with snow on A4 and A9.
According to Germany, there are major difficulties in Saska, Saska-Anhaltsk, Durynsk and in northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the wheels, turned trees on the wheels or broken tops and jumps.
In Saska, a remote operation from Lipska to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Dornish Saalfeld he had to stop an ICE from Munich.
165 passengers were on the train from firemen and lifeguards, covered with blankets, food and drink.
The snow wind waved over the road.
In large German airports, snow winds have been lifted for many years.
According to the spokesperson, information centres for years have already been reported from Munich's cancelled years.
In Frankfurt, after Mohan, it's been broken down for 40 years, according to Fraport's spokesman.
The maintenance of roads is in continuous operation.
Although there were only a few passengers left at the airport without a connection, 400 Polish beds were prepared for them.
There have been accidents on many roads in the middle of the night.
In the evening, one truck driver died at a train crash in East Holštínsk.
The engineer was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snowflake: a truck was also caught here on the railway because the vehicle had been parked.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until early hours.
And that's what a 30-year-old woman died for after she turned her car into a busy road at Aschapenburg.
Meteorologists, however, have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light-swimming, and therefore the wind will rise when light-swift.
But the wind will weaken.
Only at the Baltic Sea will there be swift winds of the strength of the vicar.
But it's going to be a big winter -- locally up to negative 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank seeks buyers for twins
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye with its mark: according to one newspaper contribution, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in the main headquarters in Frankfurt.
The real estate could amount to up to EUR 500 million.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its seat in the group: the two-star towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernised; in the meantime, bankers have been allowed to go back to their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial group obviously wants the cost of renovation again - and it's looking for buyers for both of the dark-draps, as he informs "Financial Times Deutschland" with an appeal to the speaker.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still examining whether it is more meaningful to own or sell properties and then to rent again," he said.
This gives the largest credit institution in Germany a short time ago to give up its business seat.
In mid-2007, the Bank took up twins of EUR 272 million from the investors of its own fund and then refurbished them heavily.
Energy conversion was estimated at around EUR 200 million.
The sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Experts from the sector estimate the value between the named "Greenovers" towers at a price of around EUR 500 million.
The spokesperson said it was not decided whether the building would be sold again to the fund's property or to an independent investor.
Thousands of mourners for dead miners
More than 10,000 people have dedicated themselves to the memory of fallen miners in New Zealand, who have been declared dead after several explosions down there.
The dead have not yet been released, because the security situation is still complicated in the drawer.
Almost two weeks ago there was a strong explosion in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were loaded down.
In a shaft where there was an accident, a probe was launched, but there was no sign of life.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not rise due to safety.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts came up with the fact that the miners no longer have any chance of survival.
Still couldn't get rid of the dead.
Now they are fond of the memory of dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, on the southern island of New Zealand, tens of thousands of people gathered in the sunlight.
They've been silent for two minutes.
To honor the memory of the sleeping miners, 29 tables were built, helmets, lamps and the names of the miners.
Images and personal things, such as clothes and surfing cloths, also found their place here.
In state government buildings, flags were flying at half a yard.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would again leave the "deep land" on the surface, said to the participants of the commemorative event, the Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key.
"But they never came home."
He couldn't say goodbye to his son until he saw his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was hit down.
A number of foreign diplomats were also involved in the Memorial event, with the exception of the ministerial president and relatives.
During the 19th November explosion, British and South African miners were also attacked.
The rescuers began by firing fire inside the coal bottom on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the poisonous gas is released, it begins to cool high temperatures inside the bottom, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warriors!
Is the horror of an art movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to recapture the old border with his battle epic "Wallalla Rising".
What kind of audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn mean by "Wallal Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be released from his torturers and in a great way kill almost with the supernatural force of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young men's spectators who are looking for blood actions because our hero helps with cruel methods of killing and his enemies rivets even from the belly of life when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One Eye, as it is actually called, does not say a word during the entire film and also other characters say at least one or two words or let them turn to passionate dying screams.
Otherwise, he silences himself and leads into a very beautiful hilly area of Scotland, which offers a world stage for the Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for the adult enthusiasm of cinema with an interest in existentialism and very peaceful camera footage.
It's good if he has more target groups, it's only bad if they get out of each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about the drug dealers "Pusher", is regarded as a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantina, but staically defends himself from bringing his works closer to either the humor of the main stream or the less brutal artistic audience.
The majority of art cinema's beneficiaries are likely to be treated with the brain and the interiors everywhere.
The proponents of action films will be released at the latest when the One Eye is released for free reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of the ship to Jerusalem and will remain hanging forever in the wind and youth before it seems to add a team to America and is still silent.
It's not surprising, then, that in Germany "Wallala Rising" didn't get into the movies and was now only released on DVD.
It's a pity mainly for beautiful pictures, but also because it's a personal façade, places up to the blood, hiding an exciting movie that deserved a little attention.
This film is not about dialogues or precise events, everything is an atmosphere, a hot dream that has become a film.
And it's not for a monster to escape.
Refne doesn't even take a moment of relaxation and slowly suffocates him with his cold pictures and a cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, especially an unscrupulous hater that leaps from the heart.
Only a little blond boy who helps One Eye leaves something like innocence, everyone else is driven by evil.
Of all the most unique heroes whose motives will never be explained, which will become time for enemies and transitional alliances a warrior from hell, perhaps a messenger of the Devil.
It's making up for the loss, but maybe it's just for the infected.
"Wallala Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
It's a hit.
Secret Earthwork
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Office has new attention to the secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the country won't be able to speak - and it won't be allowed to control.
About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli combat aircraft F-15 and a mysterious four-storey building in Syria will attack.
It stands on the shore of Euphrates; the nearest city is 30 kilometers away and it is called Dair as-Saur.
Its name shall appear in the documents of the International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this area hidden in the valley turning away from the river.
Based on the announcement by the US-American Foreign Secret Service CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well placed for the production of plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
Fifty-year-old technology doesn't fit into anything else.
The CIA introduced video with unsaturated satellite images.
The computer animation explained where the reactor components could have been before the destruction should be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
In addition, there were still photographs that showed the building close to or even inside.
The reactor was just a short time before the launch, but it's still out of fuel.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it's not much more than once, even the battles have increased over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that the CIA was very sure before the attack that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor, but basically there was no basis for "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some of the secret intelligence services in Europe are even more careful and speak only of the "reliable reactor", even though the CIA's presentation is considered "reliable".
They lack clear evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how he was sure that he had a reactor ahead of him, a senior UN diplomat answered in summer, the IAEA said it had "sufficient material to ask questions".
The net reportedly "non-exploited military buildings" was quickly removed by the Syrians and also properly leveled the field.
However, in June 2008 the IAEA team managed to find the uranium footprints of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received via the Member State satellite photos of commercial sellers from the time immediately after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these pictures are not on the market because they were bought exclusively by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
It is therefore not possible for the IAEA to confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that she never had a secret nuclear program or a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, Damasek said.
But it turned out to the IAEA after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damasek has refused to discuss things - as well as satellite surveys.
In addition, he banned auditors from second inspection in el-Kibar and access to poorly bombed buildings.
But Israel's gonna be quiet too.
"We will never comment," said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently.
The investigation of this case has been carried out without delay since June 2008 and "is growing into a serious problem due to the Authority's confidentiality", as the high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna has acknowledged - a serious breach of the Nuclear Weapons Prohibition Treaty, which is being monitored by the IAEA.
The IAEA considers the key to progress in the matter of three other devices that are to be "in a functional connection" with the data reactor - and there are still other than it.
However, the auditors have not so far conducted any of the devices, or any of the functions, or why they are suspected.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA is internally designated as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandarayah, driven again by nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found them on satellite imaging complex buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is likely that it is within or near the military base - for this very reason Syria refuses to access the IAEA to these three sites.
In Vienna it was reported that the Syrians are afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would have been sent ahead to investigate the military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility by the US secret service.
The IAEA has the basis and also satellite images that between these three places and the quarter at Euphrat transported the material here and there.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one facility should be "in relation to fuel production".
However, there are no "documents on sensitive activities", i.e. the enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium, which is not enriched.
However, where the uranium comes from and where it should later be sealed with plutonium on the bomb, there are only probable estimates on these central issues.
It is also not known whether the amounts that might hide important traces are stored in these three places.
As if they disappeared from the surface of the earth's hundreds of freight vehicles, no one seems to have any information about where the net came from.
Only a few kilometres away from el-Kibar and on the other side of Euphrat al-Tibni, which had Syria checked as an appropriate radioactive waste fund in 1998, considers the IAEA unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked him to the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from space show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out all suspected groundwork and removed large containers.
It could have been an accident, but it didn't help explain the suspect.
In addition, diplomatic circles are talking about the fact that the IAEA has spent many months making a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only this effort shows how much the interests of the auditors are.
In the meantime, the lady has also rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna had calmed down a year ago that the reactor was destroyed and that is why this thing is not burning, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about the so-called special inspections, which is one of the most robust means that has the Vienna nuclear power to carry out controls.
The head of the IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already spoken of "the possibilities to which I'm staying in the future", but he's still weighing.
This choice poses a great risk: On the one hand, the majority of the IAEA Government Council is needed and many of the 35 participating countries are certainly not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens when they finally find nothing?"
Love in the Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on the still unimaginable pioneering element in summer, difficulties have arisen.
She wrote the script herself, which is about the loving story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not known yet - but it also causes dissatisfaction.
It has been said that during the war in Yugoslavia, the Muslim woman fell in love with the Serbian man who raped her.
Bosnian women's teams immediately protested, so the planned film from Sarajevo to Hungary quickly moved.
In the meantime, the film has been filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but in Bosnia it is still protesting.
Bakira Hasecic from the Women's War Victims Organization wrote through the UN to help UNHCR refugees Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, now told the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also the United Nations Embassy to help refugees.
It is not quite diplomatic - it offered women a week ago to meet in Hungary, but they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the camps where she was raped, the loving stories were inconceivable, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victim reveals enough about the script.
Its organisation therefore recommended that the UN organisation assist refugees so that Jolie misses as a ambassador, the Guardian informs.
What exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given permission to read her script, after the minor tahanikas in Sarajevo's film - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author points out that he is not following any political intention in his film that he has made a great effort to address the conflict in Yugoslavia, that he wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all the parties involved.
Because of its content, it remains uncertain.
There's another version of the movie on the Internet that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the war started and they met again when she was as a Bosnian Muslim dragged into the Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
Which sounds quite different than "the victim of rape falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that movie Jolie really starts before the war - it's true.
Jolie denies that she is under pressure that "is not fair and is based on misinformation".
Now they can free her already are the hackers from Hollywood: By publishing on the Internet the script, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone
This evening it's good for Iry once again.
No sign of sadness.

"Pivní pong" is called a bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and to that end a flight to Las Vegas to the world championship in the beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this sobbing beer game and endurance computer, it doesn't work much together.
However, the 26-year-old man is trying to have fun, to respond to a heavy question that brings about the future.
His plan is not a playful passion in Las Vegas, he's going to the interview in January to New Zealand.
"I have such a strange feeling," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job."
However: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "at once she has got her dreamed work as EventManager, maybe it's a good sign," says a young man and smiles.
Because of poor prospects at home, two out of three Tanner relatives have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now serves as an IT consultant in London.
Boys leave: As with Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
100 000 Iros leave the country at the relevant time, according to experts at the Institute of Science for Economic and Social Affairs of the ESRI in Dublin.

"For beginners in the labour market, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
He's known about what it's like to build somewhere else for half a year, Sean O'Donovan.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
He's just building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hannover or to Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan will rarely get home because he works in extra shifts so he can pay home the loan at home.
"Sometimes the situation is really a little crazy," he says, when the first time after a long time exceeds the threshold of his own home.
"I'm making money in Germany at a house in Ireland where I'm not at all."
He laughs in despair and walks in cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, parking large expensive cars in the stars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent financed by the loan.
"It was a crazy time, easy money was without a lot of questions," he says.
I'm afraid it shouldn't have been good with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, he drops hot tea and says, "I don't have kids I have to live and I'm young; though everything turns around, I can start again."
The construction engineer doesn't like the call that he's hearing so often.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as before on this island," he says.
"Working abroad is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father who left for the last economic crisis in England.
"After seven years he was back again and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep your future open and just wait for how your life will develop elsewhere.
He's been in London for years, too, and why shouldn't it be in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend as well?
But there's one more thing that worries him enough about these days: celebrating his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
They're afraid she might turn around for a farewell party.
"Frequently no emotion," she says and drinks a beer.
"Good-bye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a celebration of departure, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Regular practice of democracy
The support of democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the support of private businesses.
The criminal activity is causing greater concerns than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarometer survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been taking place regularly since 1995, it is possible to monitor changes in attitudes across the whole area.
In this year's research, which took place in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first of them is that Latin America has a relatively happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
The support of democracy in several countries on the coast of the Pacific in South America has grown significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has increased by 6% annually since 2002, the support for democracy has increased from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew up in Mexico, where the economy recovered from a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most populous areas, are democratic convictions, which is downgrading the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of respondents across the whole area expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, it is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a big increase (Graph 3).
The 34% survey indicated that they believe in snow in their country and 45% trust the government, again talking about the same numbers as last year, but it is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis was undermining democracy in Latin America.
Support arose during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger network of social security has helped to protect the poor.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and decreased again to 32% this year.)
But the tide changes in a wide spectrum from country to country (see Figure 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President, Louise Inácia Luly da Silva, is reflected in a broad sense accepted for progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and worsened the violent crime scene.
Just the second time the surveys began, he sees more respondents across Latin America as the most important problem of crime than unemployment (see Figure 5).
Gruba 31% says that either they themselves or their close relatives became victims of criminal activity last year, but this is a decrease compared to 38% of last year's data and is also the lowest since 1995.
The more massive economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprises and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the whole area say that private enterprises are necessary for development, this percentage grew from 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that allows their country to develop, this percentage grew from 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private businesses), although their left-wing President Hugo Chávez owns many private companies.
Brazil is a country with a leading position in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, versus 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela is pleased to succeed in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised Elections
No one expected the general elections in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders who were trying to help the affected country to fear.
Elections meant filling the urns and repeating voting, voting cards scattered through channels, broken polling rooms and intimidation.
Election rooms open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced for the reason of the ice earthquake, had wandered around and tried to find out where to go.
Some of them finally gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a number of alleged predecessors, shouted that it was a fraud and they called after the election was cancelled.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, a highly established UN official in Haiti, said that "in many respects it was quite a good choice."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean said carefully that "they do not believe that these imbalances, however serious, could not necessarily disrupt the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, whose opposition votes are committed to René Préval, a non-popular retreating president and his candidate Jude Célestin, shall announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is planned for ice.
All election hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, former first lady, withdrew from their original challenge to be declared invalid.
However, a problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support among the voters, is appointed by the electoral commission for reaching a decisive battle.
Because of the ongoing epidemic of hell and more than 1 million people still living after the earthquake in the states, fears over the fact that election participation will be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to choose, but for the sake of disorganization, they were banned.
The strike of 250 thousand identity certificates necessary for voting remained briefly before the elections.
There's a lot in the bet.
Gifts see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a key step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear, then, that the Haitians are alone.
By the tip to the center
In the weeks when she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, the Argentine President, was moved by public sympathy when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, to the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this success into a successful campaign for the second term of office in the elections next year may depend on whether the grieving Mrs Fernández gives up the incompatibility of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And it'll all be based on these signs.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in economic policy and after his wife successfully became president, usually had budgets that underestimated tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to lose further revenue according to liberacy.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost most last year in Congress.
But the opposition split up and was further destabilized at the death of Mr. Kirchner on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling political movement Peronis added to Mrs. Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (which led to the falsification and accusation of corruption by the government), Congress was unable to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to come," said the president.
The 2010 budget will also be paid for next year, with more space for the president to lose according to Liberia.
The economy is overheating: this year is likely to grow to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about the figure that is approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who went to the office in 2003, when Argentina was under economic collapse, set the priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than for inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, charged the private sector and cleared INDIC, a statistical agency that had joined the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now measure this policy?
She called for a dialogue between private businesses and the committee's remittances.
And her officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy has been supported by the growth of world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation disrupted the growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is aware that he wants to restore Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government entered into an agreement with the debtor who had previously refused the restructuring of the debt which Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Now, President Fernández is facing a deal with the religious governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted on not having this reality under the supervision of the IMF, as usual.
But last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Agriculture announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to propose a new national consumer-price index that would remind us of the introduction to clean up INDIC.
It is not clear until now whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of the term of office when the husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get the support of the middle class, which is tired of ecclesiasticalism.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from the summer vacation they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If he wants to win another election, he will have to decide whether it won't be necessary to say a lot of opinions that her husband has been standing in politics.
Half-incentives for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a close connection with the fortress.
How does Taiwan feel about his big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million volunteers, 70% of those entitled, elected on 27 November the mayor and the council of the city in five urban districts, which can be considered a broader assessment by President Ma Ying-jeu.
Mr. President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings which have prevailed firmly and have been strong in business relations, including agreements on partial free trade, in the biggest comparison of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but just tight.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) finished winning three out of five seniors, he was unable to win most of the votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is committed to greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of all votes against 45% of KMT.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would have had trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was together with KMT in city councils.
The elections were played as a majority of Taiwanese elections, which include noisy pick-up cars and mass assembly with low-dressed girls.
Part of it was even a secret attempt to assassinate.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chana, honorary president of KMT, was agitated for KMT candidates in the pre-election evening.
The man from the van shot young Mr. Lien straight across his face, wound her and killed the monster.
It was certainly not determined whether the armed man intended to hurt Mr. Lien or to settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the elections, the suspect falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how she remained in the background of the issue of self-defence.
Instead, the candidates began to poll on plans for state-owned housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
So KMT tends to avoid ties to government in Beijing.
But this time DPP also left behind the incitement of anti-Chinese positions.
It is a response to reality and is aware that Chinese trade has a key role to play in Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma confirmed, on his part, that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
From the government in Beijing, it can be expected that it will continue to make commercial payments, together with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the herd.
China did not waste its time sending a negotiator to Taipei to set up a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course they would also like to see political integration, but in turn.
It will be better to wait for the presidential elections in 2012.
In any case, the DPP page has revealed itself.
Two years ago she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on the grounds of corruption charges.
The President in 2000-08 was a storm and a standstill of clear independence.
But under Mrs. Tsai's leadership, a new generation has developed, which is moderate and DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs. Tsai was called as a DPP candidate for the president, such as Su Tseng-change, who was standing under Mr. Chen.
Their side is now doing everything they can to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms Tsai published plans for research institutes serving as a contact point between DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai informs the Taiwanese public that her party is a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's surprising approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry with this move.
In his statement of intent, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would do better if they claimed that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, pragmatics, not to stand up for the president.
But even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's assessment was wrong, even though the pace of economic growth was too high; KMT's candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
Its disfavor seems to be based in particular on unemployment and deepening the gap between the rich and the poor.
Speaking KMT says he reorganizes his cabinet, as well as local sidewalks.
Strongly promoted proposals for Taiwan's support for the binding of friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonia Chiang, the prominent advertiser, "the point from which there is no return has already come."
Nomination at Grammy: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
A speech at the request of the President and people must be legally observed.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassette and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is marked as one of the surprises of Grammy's awards this year with nominations in the best new artist category.
Given that Spalding has been celebrated by a jazz stage since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" came out, the nomination came a bit late, but it is in accordance with Grammy's rules, when the artist should not issue more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her 2010 ambitious album "Chamber Music Society" certainly took a step forward and thanks to its carefree vocal style and hbit hand with the elements of pop, fun and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as the success that Norah Jones recorded in 2003, the closest equivalent for voters in Gramma who are looking for similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
The other jurors of Grammy by law rated the album Vijay Iyer Trio "History" in the category of instrumental album, exciting, refreshing album ride, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album by experienced saxophoneist James Moody "Moody 4B" and John Beasley "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a brave favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in the HBO "Treme" series was rated in the current jazz category, which is otherwise attracted to Stanley Clark's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lober.
The Wild Group of the Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with the knowledge of the Stampunk has won several deserved recognitions in the category of big files, when in competition the chamber jazz Children Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the Oct. "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how the base can have a free hand as a band.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
Nominations for classical music have a wide collection of musicians and composers from all over the world at Grammy's 53rd annual awards.
The leading position in the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" as a piano and orchestra, with the number five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", eclectic orchestral work, with the number three points.
Among those nominated to be bound in Southern California was Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The founder of L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance to appreciate it.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories that include orchestral, opera, assembly and solo recordings.
The categories of classical music producer are five nominated by Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" from Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals project; "Sacrifium - the Art of the Castrati" introducing various artists; and Verdiho "Requiem" from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As regards the category of works, the appointments are Berg and "Lulu" by Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Marine Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers who are nominated on Grammy for contemporary compositions are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatemente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had a premiere at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a performance recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the touch of Esa-Pekka Salonena.
About 30 minutes away is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnet Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for the instrumental performance of the soloist with the orchestra.
The author of L.A. stated that he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for the Mandolin interpretation of Avi Avital, who was performing at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble with a seat in New York.
"I wrote it with the help of the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a phone conversation.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, received nominations in the category for orchestral performance, led by Chicago Symphony in recording Stravinsk's work.
Among the instrumental soloists who received the nominations are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the drummer Paul Jacobs; the housemaker Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented among the nominated vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sophie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical transition, soprano Jesse Norman won her title "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mixture in Temecule is approved by the Planning Commission
The planned mixture in Temecule has received unanimous support from the local planning commission over five hours of passionate public witness.
Critics attacked a project that promotes terrorism and will lead to a stop to trade.
However, the jury decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in accordance with local laws and will be aesthetically effective.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you remember," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"I'm as proud as an American citizen."
"It means that justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" added.
"Those who are opposed only shout out loud."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The discussion began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost midnight, when most of the time they took discussions with people who were for or against the center. These votes were equally divided, says Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the websites of the news.
"There is no America anymore," one comment appeared.
"We are the Planet monkeys with Socha's freedom trapped in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centre also launched protests in other parts of the country, including the vicinity of Ground Zero, the site of the tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious council of about 135 families joined the Riverside County after years without an incident, but wanted more and more space than the storage space he rented together with the producer of filtering systems.
The new mix of 24 943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minerals and grow to a height of 43 feet.
She's supposed to take the place of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
The opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Microbes with arsenic resistance increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its animals, expands space to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps even further.
Researchers have discovered unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has options that are beyond the main elements that have been considered and fundamental.
"This organism has a dual capacity."
"It can grow either by phosphorus or arsenic."
"This reality is very special, but it is not evidence that it is a form of truly 'foreign' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the news that appeared on Thursday in the online publication of Science magazine.
It has long been considered necessary for the life of six main elements - coal, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and cheese.
However, scientists have found that bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake in California, are able to continue to grow once phosphorus is replaced by arsenic.
"It will start to surprise you as much as possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for finding life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life may look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, the news about this newspaper was published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the findings, caused widespread speculation on the Internet that the news revealed the discovery of alien life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms can be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that the present elements that we consider 'standard' do not have to be so essential for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't an accident.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake, because it shows a high level of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are very similar chemical elements, so she thought that a microb that is exposed to both elements could be able to replace each other.
"Arzen is poisoned mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very difficult to separate these elements from themselves."
"Nonetheless, arsenic is so different that it does not work like phosphorus. When it reaches the body, it begins to work in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists gather bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and show them an increasing concentration of arsenic, which bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better in the influence of phosphorus, but since they can also survive with a replacement arsenic, the possibility that the form of life that uses arsenic may naturally appear, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or in months where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an expert microbiology assistant at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, is not new, but there was never an example to prove this reality.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so the scientists speculated that it could be used in earlier forms of life.
"This suggests that there could be other ways of creating life, not just the way it was created in the early days of the Earth," Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team, said.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower motel were found.
Four exhibition dogs - two shots and the big pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Belflower 6 motel.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and two dogs were left on Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, spokesperson of the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is that dogs are okay," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their right-holders."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which location, but did not share detailed information regarding their findings.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not caught so they could express themselves.
They were delighted to find their two o'clock in the middle of the afternoon in the shelter at Downey.
The sheriffs found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Action Trace, three-year-old dog Trace and 10-month-old fan Didi, were unharmed, the authorities reported.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek tribe, who were scheduled to participate in this week of regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unscrupulous until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other competitions scheduled for days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
South California is just one stop on almost a month's trip to the dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered for the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - the dog boxer, the Parson Russell terrier and the British bakery - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Stocks and Pembroke Welsh basket left in a car where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened the windows a little bit so that dogs in the car would have enough fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported car theft at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who's taking them to the missing dogs, dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
It wasn't clear on Thursday if prices were to be paid.
Lev is ready to yell again now that the restructuring of MGM has received final approval from the court
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM finally got green so it could start again.
On Thursday, the Federal Insolvency Judge of New York officially blessed the "before packaged" plan of creditors to balance about $5 billion of debt and thus clean up the road for 86 years of old entertainment that focuses on the production and production of films and television shows.
Fourthly, the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. competition order, there are no legal obstacles to MGMs being able to re-launch the founders of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main leaders of the planned study.
The number of employees will fall to about 320 out of the originals more than 400.
MGM shall not be drawn up immediately from Chapter 11, until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources enabling a loan of $500 million to finance new MGM operations and production.
Now it's a connection with an investment bank that alone needs $75 million and funding is expected to be around half December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to settle its finances, as management was fighting to allow interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former Director General of Enron and an expert on turning, known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelise and Cooper to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 study believers took a long time to figure out.
After a few months of discussion, the parties agreed that they were selling the company by the end of 2009.
Although auctions attracted several stakeholders, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the funds that believers demanded.
In spring this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the believer at the end of October.
When MGM officially rises from the competition in the next few weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive $9.5 million.
Cooper companies that invest in their services that run the company, $375 000 a month, will receive a reward for their success, i.e. "success fee" $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to renew production in MGM, which only released one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will be released in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the funding of two films that will be presented by the book "Hobit", together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share in these two films that Peter Jackson will direct.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debt, was looking for the possibility of combining the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies did not terminate the agreement.
Technology toys that will keep your gift budget balanced
The leader of this year's candidate is the most amazing iPad player followed by the video game system. In both cases it is a significant contribution to the gift budget.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five rounds of BMX for $99 and one game Kinect is equal to 10 coral screws or about 48 calibers Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget balanced.
I recently visited three national toys vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholeesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law was working; this year's technological toys have far more energy, and at the same prices, if not less, compared to last years.
While relatively less new toys have appeared with associated websites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkins and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with battery buttons is increased, as is the number of battery chargers.
Here are some recommendations.
(All these prices are from Toys "R" Us, except for cases that are otherwise stated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, 3 years old) are dusty animals that sing when you push them through the belly.
At one compression, the animal emits the tone and the second compression begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start dating, you cannot stop.
The best choice in a combination of song and dance is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years old)
Last year, I borrowed 14-inch animated doll from Elmo Live technology, who can play Simon Says and can also take a month's walk thanks to its innovative closed foot with wheel locking.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor's toy, even though their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are an 80-year-old child, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playscool, $40, for children aged 3 years), with a bag full of quiz carts that are designed so that the car ride turns into fun with work with self-repaired, funny work sets.
If you send a smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$ for children from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest option with simple use, with qwerty keyboards, although the games do not have as effective training as Leafster Explorer (70$ for children from 3 to 12 years old), the first significant change in the Leoster series from Leaffrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$ for children from 3 to 7 years old) uses iTunes-like to launch games and e-books and has a SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children from 8 years old) is a file of five cubes that are not larger than a box than a puzzle, each of them has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing cubes in a row before time runs out; it is great for competition in improvised word creation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest extent, two toys were represented in the toys of Webkins and Club Penguin.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains coins with hidden code.
When you activate online code, your child will get enough credit in Club Penguin store on any two items.
That could include a wheelchair or an animal called Puffle.
About something a little bigger than your toothbrush is Hexbug Nano (10$ for children over 5 years), the latest of a number of microbots on a button battery.
Broke moves fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's fun when you make a puzzle out of bones and watch if he can find a way out.
He's also very strong.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in the pressure of our dog.
Introducing more subtle police controls in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin went to the square, strictly controlled his orders, and issued orders with the military authority.
He wanted women's members - the Chinese state-run urban order runners, frightened and insulted for their hard moves and violence appeal - to raise a certain impression on the deaf.
"Stand straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispers quietly, "How beautiful girls look!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive caps and pants were brought to attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted as one by one.
Four head coverings are perfectly seated on the hair, which are perfectly bound by blue and white foam.
"I personally think they look average," said Mr. Tang surpassingly.
"Models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered the new branches to have higher education.
The Guangdong Province has transformed grey-green uniforms into a much more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the opposing views of a strong weapon: in 2009, a report stated that 50 officers were constantly surrounded by candles and were staring at the owner when the underground salesman packed and left for half an hour.
Xindu, a city period of 680,000 people in Chengdu, was the main image of the operation.
Since 2003, he has supplemented his urban police with 13 women who have been selected specifically from their perspective, coherence and youth.
The goal is to show the police side as well as the women's side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson himself would have had trouble getting to the secret Chinese city groups.
They would argue criticism for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are allowed only to promote the city's announcement, to impose fines and other administrative duties.
But Chinese media usually capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the province of Hubei killed an unaccompanied viewer after he used his cell phone to film how they began in the protest case against the shipowner.
Last year, police training was carried out in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. The manual included a description of how to effectively break down bloodless markers.
This year, a underground melon dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five policemen and suffered left-handed brain injury.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded online shows Chinese policemen how they attack a street salesman.
"Chenguan scared the government," China Daily, a national edition, called last year after another discussion about tactics.
There was "a really thorough cleaning on the paper."
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After the October issue of eight new women's police officers, the head of the Beijing Evening News was concerned about whether women have real obligations or are just a waste of time.
The answer seems to be from both sides.
The district demanded women from 18 to 22 years of age with a good attitude and "five faces in the right proportion."
Adhesives should be higher than the average - that is, more than 1.6 meters.
The 26th grade is mandatory.
Officials claim that work is mentally too difficult for women over 25 years.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unnamed police officer at Rednet.com, like government websites.
"The candidates must first prove the external qualities, which then determine the others, belong to them in height, weight, face, etc."
Then comes a series of character and inner quality.
Women are like flower bonds, he said and added, "In addition to being bound, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city's management, disagrees with this description.
But he pointed out that the requirements for height are also common in China for other jobs, and that in both sexes.
Just like the demand for a balanced face.
Which means that the issue of good looks is the subject of discussion between China.
Health problems or freezing are certainly not applicable.
"He cannot allow us to serve a fragile or backward man," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is watching Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, face like an apple and a well-formed mouth.
She doesn't think that the focus on her looks could have an existential roots, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked herself with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with dolls, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our task is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are bigger than just starting traders into streets where they can carry out their activities.
Each morning, a group stands against more than ten marketers running on foot or on wheels and tries to sell as many beads and tofu as possible before they are removed.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you this many times!" said Miss Xu, when the marketman started running away, and for a time left his bike with a car with nothing.
Cops describe their duties as more monotonous than wet.
"Every day is essentially about the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in his free marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that women policemen have no power as their male opponents to entertain goods.
They can only threaten to report the facts to their male leader.
The trend is then to protect them from sudden public manifestations of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, woke up after false news of police killing the sellers.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the night hours; 14 government vehicles were converted or burned.
Xinda's been out of such violence so far.
But peace can only be assured of hardship.
Only two blocks from the quiet bay Baoguang, where policemen were watching this morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The cops had fun riding a motorcycle that was fixed on a treadmill inside the store, as required by the regulations.
The car owner could cry as he wanted.
15 minutes' distance from the police officer, facing the leak, with the wheels against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator of the male group, remained behind, his white mark turned to hide his name.
Like female policemen, the coordinators are men over 40 years of age who already have only a helpful role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in the maintenance and freezing of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li for good.
"Mostly it's the public that starts with it."
Prosecutors won't charge Senator Ensigna
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensigna of the criminal charge concerning his affair with his former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure the lobby, announced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, a NGOs Republican, faced and was, until the time of the scandal, regarded as a potential Republican candidate for the president for 2012. His affair got into national titles and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensigna's office said it was a decision that followed almost after the annual investigation, "for sure pleased".
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings before the Senate Ethics Commission.
Mr Ensigna's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the object of the investigation and that it is not planned to bring further charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr Ensign had prepared a violation of the federal lobby ban.
The interviews, e-mails and other documents that were published in the New York Times in October 2009 indicated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that would lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the Senator's relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasurer in the Ensigna campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after Mr. Hampton has been employed to lobby for them, so much the documents and interviews are provided.
Since Hampton was a former assistant to Mr Ensigna, he was excluded from the law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts claim that Mr. Ensigna and Mr. Hampton's unusual arrangements, which were in the presence of his friends, were in opposition to the lobbying ban.
Of the evidence that was published "it has been revealed that it is a clear case of preparation for a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in protecting clients who are investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision on Senator Ensigna, Mr Brand and other ethics lawmakers said that the ministry was careful with regard to political complaints, according to a large number of incidents, including the decision of last year to stop the complaint against former Senator Ted Stevens in the midst of accusations of State misdemeanour.
The Federal Prosecutors "clearly concealed weapons", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Organisation for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a group of lawyers who filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign.
"It basically indicates that high-level government officials are not covered by the laws," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief lawyer, Mr Ensigna, announced in the interview that he had been called on Monday by the State Representative of the Ministry of Justice and then on the second day, and told him that the ministry had not sought any charges against his client.
Mr. Ensigna's defence team is working with the plaintiff in an attempt to convince him that the senator, as his office repeated in the middle statement, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he submitted to the State representatives.
"It is not nice for me to count the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop the investigation of an independent complaint, in which the ethical group accuses the parents of Ensigna Hamptons of 96,000 dollars in violation of the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbyist work was NV Energy, the leading NGO that has been supporting the senator for a long time.
An e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton started acting as a lobbyist in the company, the employees of Mr. Ensigna - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "bushing" into the Ministry of Interior on the subject under discussion.
Mr Ensign also took part in lunch with Mr. Hampton and other NGOs, Allegiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he hired Mr. Hampton at lobbyist work.
When the affair was first reported last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his wishes and resigned to his office as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After several months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign informed reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the third parliamentary term in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer the aim of investigating the crime of his spokesperson Jennifer Cooper stated that the senator hopes that the ethical commission will follow the Ministry of Justice quickly and complete the entire investigation.
"Señor Ensign is looking forward to continuing his efforts on behalf of the people of Nevada," she said.
Challenge of the village of Cheshire to turn to Twitter
In a number of courtrooms, half a dozen of them were written.
A minute after a minute, they sent news about the terrible testimony on Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter news was involved in rape and child-incarceration in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire citizens, Connecticut, the family, and was due to end the official death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with requests and arguments that the court would probably have employed for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by the main reporters - created a "Circus atmosphere" and this expanded, immediate disclosure of information with exciting details then introduced the jury in decision-making in terms of public opinion influence.
This claim could cause a judge to question whether new technologies would also require new rules in court.
"As I have experienced this transformation, I think there is a real danger that the integration of new technologies in the courthouse affects the right of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief advocate of Mr Hayes.
The judge of the Jon C. Blue Supreme Court of the State briefly rejected the claim regarding the outcome of the last week and that the media were "safely controlled" and that there was no evidence showing that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
Over the decades, the Court has acknowledged that notoriety of known cases may raise questions about the fairness of the proceedings.
In the 1966 Supreme Court of the United States of America's court order, Dr. Sam Sheppard was dismissed for murdering his wife when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, it was a "carnival atmosphere" for the media.
Some people are convinced that this crime was an inspirational television show and movie "Flying".
Some lawyers said that the appeals that examined Hayes' judgment half a century later could be surprised by the argument that there might be new rules necessary to determine how to communicate in the direction of the courts, which was unimaginable in Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media," said John J. Donohue III, professor of law Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was done voluntarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be interested in the idea that restrictions on immediate communication in the direction of judicial shadow can make the process more fair.
The case of Twitter is only one of many shadowed lawyers, Mr Hayes, who would be able to argue for years in order to refrain from executing the judgment.
Advocates also claim, for example, that in the case of Mr Hayes, it may be a matter of supposition when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jury members by showing them criminal pictures of fear when selecting a jury.
Some of the jury stated that they were frightened by the photos of the victim that Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
Defenders claim that they will also refuse the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly appealed to a jury that was critical to the state representatives and that by his decision he wrongly imposed greater pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jury wasn't separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They objected to the verdict brought up last month that the case was dominated by reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign against the governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media were constantly exhaling the flames of emotion in this case.
"The daily invasion of the media, cameras and reporters before the court," wrote the lawyer, "was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven, and it may also be a state rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the discussions, some journalists claimed that the immediate reporting was more overwhelming than the later reports, and from their point of view, the judicial police should be in charge of other proceedings.
But some lawyers have called for appeals to the courts with often used arguments that social and technological changes require court adaptation.
Mr. Hayese's lawyers are working on this right.
In their archives they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in Dr. Sheppard's judgment, because of the wide scope of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell in the 21st century."
Can the courtroom overcome the disaster?
After the campaign, which was remarkable for its insults and negativity, a small amount of hypocrisy appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first owner of real cooperation between the two political parties or just an illusion moment before a quick return to the side fighting in the capital?
The President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers and the Heads of Parliament did not present any essential findings on the main issues to be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, there was a heated debate on the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of the side-compensation.
The average public meeting of the President's deficit committee was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close coexistence for several months has built up mutual respect, which goes beyond the ideological failure that members continue to divide.
And it's pretty hard to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in the trial period - they are investigating each other's signs of collegiality and compromise, attempting to assess the limits of public opinion and voluntary tolerance towards the renewed side-war.
Therefore, Tuesday's proceedings and its subsequent evaluation of the participant were also conducted with minimum requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republics are too wide and too deep to propose a rapid change in the ratios that have prevailed in the last two years.
Whether it's tax, expenditure, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections prepared Washington at least quickly.
"There is no question whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable by choice.
The election sparked the emotions of the parties, and then they shut up.
It's good."
In a number of issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax reduction at the end of the year has disappeared and no one considers it to be favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, which is either permanent or temporary.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment rates only because Republicans cannot look at how they support tax reductions for the property while the unemployed refuse unemployment aid.
After Tuesday's debate in the White House, there is already a greater optimism about the possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new opening agreement.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between the two political parties when the 112nd Congress calls for ice.
Rather, it's probably a period of trouble, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing the things that have to be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short term," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is to a large extent extended - that the court will lead them to genuine cooperation.
"I look at all the events between today and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
The reason is largely related to the setting up of a new republican majority in the White House and the tea parties that helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of enlargement, know that they must act in accordance with their promises and reduce government spending and abolish the new health care law.
These attachment lines are clear in the initial reactions to recommendations on deficits, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase in certain taxes, the increase in the retirement age and the reduction of expenditure.
Social Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their view, have to develop the pressure of deficit issues to the public programme of ways that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes in the 18th member committee so that they can present their plan as an official recommendation and thus fight to get as close as possible to this number.
The biggest resistance is among the elected jury officials who propose that in the case of financial matters we have, at least today, small foundations or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first year will begin in the form of side conflicts, when the Republics call on Obama to solve the budget, tax and health care, when the period of greater side cooperation will follow.
What's causing the motion?
Public opinion.
There is plenty of evidence that despite the pageant in the last elections, most Americans still want to see two parties working together.
If it could be directed to the paternity, as it was in 1995, then both sides will closely monitor the public’s response.
Anyone will be threatened by a reduction in votes, will probably change the course and will seek compromise.
That could be an optimistic view of the matter.
The pageancy and orientation are larger today than it was in the mid-19ties and it is shown that there was a greater ideological failure between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans than it was in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a foreplay for more important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, the court which emerged this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will be a lot of effort on both sides to find common foundations on issues that still divide them.
An American document looks like Moscow as a refuge for corruption
The city's management is in the hands of a "cliptocracy" and continues part of the payments and protection payments that come to Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia took place in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service have a large number of protective wings that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal transactions but also from organised criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "the office's verticals" - will take his money when the money starts to move up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington on behalf of Ambassador John Beyle, was published on the media via WikiLeaks on their websites.
The record shall be based on the sources whose name has been edited.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor and accused her of much corruption.
He was revoked by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but since then we can only monitor minimal changes in purity.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have been constantly supporting corruption charges for many years, and won several charges for criminal charges for such charges.
In September, he said to the Russian television station when asked about proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's shit."
The Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their company is corrupt, it will be shown to vote.
However, it is unusual to meet such details in such a way as to be expressed in the embassy report, and it is also not uncommon that diplomats from foreign countries would do so.
"The Moscow City Government and its association with criminal animals have led some to call it "disfunctionary," and confirm that the government works more like a kleptocracy than a government," the report says.
"The criminal elements are happy with the so-called 'krsa' (the term of the criminal and mafia world, which literally means 'cover' or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the State Representative, as well as everywhere in Moscow's government bureaucracy.
"Analytics have identified a three-step structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is on his own top."
"Federal Security Service, Ministry of the Interior and militia are at second level."
"And finally at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty spaces in some areas because the city does not provide some services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the largest companies and the police are focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, "Trade owners in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (better than organised criminal groups), as they do not only have more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in course."
The record says that while the choice of money is complex, protection alone can already have problems; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who don't pay fast enough are closing their shops under different conditions.
The bear spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but he admitted that he had made little progress.
The embassy report is talking about the men taking the case, probably the hurried cash, to the Kremlin himself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said George Satarov, director of the Moscow research team Ind.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because there are no more political classes in Russia."
No politics, no opposition, no division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that Russia's corruption stands internationally at more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154th place in the recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the Non-Governmental Organisation of Transparency International (the country is ranked from at least after the most corrupt).
The discovery of the report by the American Embassy, which appeared in Moscow until late evening hours, certainly did not provoke the Russian government's enthusiasm, although only to the extent that Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's shortcomings can it be possible for Kremlin to argue on the issue of solving the problem.
In a discussion with CNN, Larry King informed Putin that the documents that WikiLeaks published could have been fakes and reacted furiously to the statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth about the whole thing is that it's about our mutual coexistence, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so inethical."
The Red Khmer Veterans are forced to deal with the past
In a low-lighted concrete training with contaminated and ruined walls, the principal of the Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who erected it, the leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves The Mok."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Srang Kor Ma, 42.
It is known as the "cutter" for its harshness during the Rudh Khmer government, the commander of this remote country of Rudh Khmer in northwest Cambodia remains popular, where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after Rudi Khmer's surrender to the governments, the long-lasting loyality is also in Anlong Veng.
In April there was a victim of the fóru pravdy a osmířeníno vožžněno sé confrontativo with people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that explain the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers for the first time.
And in July, the United Nations and the Cambodian Court will bring together the first sentence of the former Red Khmer article, the judgment of a former leader, notorically known violent association Tuol Slang, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With every such progress, there has been a growing dissatisfaction among the Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng, which complicates efforts to calm down and reintegrate their efforts into Cambodian society.
"One of the former Red Khmeris is terror and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian documentation centre, an independent organization that is investigating the regime.
"For them life among the Red Khmer was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Red Khmer government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, it was estimated that 1.7 million people were repaired or died of hunger, disease or reprocessing.
When the Vietnamese attacked and defeated the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they started a resurrection that lasted until the last move in December 1998.
Paul Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading partisan wars from their base in mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok was cultivating a standup in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-19th century, after a peace agreement, sponsored by the UN, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to move to the government, which led to the capitalisation of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Paul Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who survived, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby mountains of Dangreek.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while waiting for trial.
Their mercenaries have no longer cared for them, most of the former Red Khmer warriors have fallen into the ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them are nostalgic in their time of movement.
Although several elite Red Khmers held their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefit from their capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs a public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were raising without any idea of making a deal."
Sir Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before he settled as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmer was good," he said.
"This Mok enjoyed all."
"But now life is hard because we have to make sure of everything ourselves."
The justice of the Red Khmer also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Khmerese.
The court is supposed to order a complaint by the leading offenders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said that it will continue in the four cases.
It was just a little to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculations focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was the district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the reign of the Red Khmer at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she was looking after the construction of Trapeang Thma, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
Last couple night, Im Chaem returned from field work to his wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to rise and the shadows appeared over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Red Khmers.
If the court called her, she'd refuse to go.
"In Cambodia peace will prevail and it is stable," she said.
"If there's another criminal complaint, there's a war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who passed from the Red Khmer in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought out other suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, Chhang Yek said from the documentation centre.
"Relievement in Khmer means blindness of broken pieces," he said.
"It's our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand."
The Centre has issued the first teacher by the government approved by the Red Khmer, has 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the teacher of the history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four parties on the Red Khmer.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew only a few details about the Red Khmers, despite connecting the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said that a new textbook helps students understand the important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he took the book home to study.
"My family refuses a lot of textbooks and courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will complain."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more difficult and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forum, the teachers and the court began to have influence, he continued to announce.
The Khmer Rouges here still have a strong spell.
Up in the mountains of Dangrek Mountains is a path that is full of mud and scattered with scattered plastic bags, which leads to a border of black sats, covered with a sharp back cover.
Paul Pota's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Noum Sothea, 31, a mobile salesperson on the road said he didn't know much about the man who was burned at the site.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Noum Sothea was born and was scheduled to visit the place of rest of Paul Pot, where she would bring a link of mature bananas in the hope that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees that its weapons stocks are based on uranium
In a surprising victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material all over the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they are giving up their stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint declaration issued after the Security Summit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Hillary Rodham Clinton and by the Belarusian Minister of Foreign Affairs by Sergei Martyn.
After years, the U.S. government tried to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and it seemed that the last spring had been hit by a rock.
But U.S. officials have said the Washington Post that in the last two months, a few hidden operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons based on uranium from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for the middle agreement to remove the residue of material - about 500 pounds, according to the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Safety Summit in April, on which Belarus was expelled.
And it was apparently a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group that supports nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal "a major, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials all over the world for four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to rid themselves of all their highly enriched uranium supplies.
Belarus will be the seventh.
Tens of thousands of countries have done so for George W. Bush.
At the Obama nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never surrender its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically the basis for weapons and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our commodity... we don't want to make dirty bombs and we don't want to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and expressed an interest in reaching the agreement.
The first obligation to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly evaporated, the officials announced.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian storage and liquidation facility, the officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and the plane was conducted, the officers said.
The U.S. government has lost $13 million for the programme, most of which to hand over less enriched uranium to the Belarusian research institution, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, the head of the Energy Ministry working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for the study of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for the manufacture of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration, strive to remove its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained throughout the year, especially because of the harsh repression of human rights in Lukashenko.
But the middle statement indicates the possibility of a gradual decline.
"We welcome the progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improved relations and is necessary for the country's progress and its inhabitants," he said.
The Spanish government didn't make the CIA's flights.
The Spanish government did not make any money for the CIA flights carrying the Taliban and members of Al-Qaida to Guantanam across the Spanish territory, as the United States envoy in Madrid said on his telegram.
This is the result of the documents provided by the Wikileaks El País server, where it is also written that then Prime Minister María Teresa Fernándezová de la Vegová asked her to be informed by the Spanish executive and "could thus show that she has appropriate oversight of foreign aircraft flying Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe, which accused tens of states, including Spain, of their participation in human rights violations, a meeting took place between US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The representative of the Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe's communication "declared Zapater's government from the game" and argued that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain does not have a problem with the flight of secret services across its territory.
"They just want to be informed," said Aguirre in one of the documents.
The then Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel Moratinos pointed out to the American Ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter as low as possible, but by having it in the hands of judges, the cabinet had limited influence".
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as he is concerned, he did not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the disclosure of documents of the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence for CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated component or sensitive information," the Ambassador explained after a discussion with the prosecutor.
However, the United States expressed its concerns rather than about the disclosure of CNI information or the Ministry of Defence's clear coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to deal with this case discreetly between governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the lunch of the US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, this ambassador announced that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what they will consider appropriate", he has already instructed his collaborators, "to avoid divergent comments with a view to reducing tension".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the political party Party Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - late January) in this matter.
"Even in spite of its general proamerical orientation, our experience tells us that the Party of Popular will not weigh on any indication that Zapater's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the US negotiations that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if this revelation could have negative consequences for the U.S. government," he notes.
Recognised mother-murderer complained online about mother's "old age"
A young woman talked about a child when she was dead, and she had her blog, "Teror after Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández says "Muki" on the Internet.
with this nickname, which she has been using since then, she has communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruña, where a young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know women's emotional life that ABC's journal reconstructs with the help of the testimony of its family members.
A thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered into relations with industrialist Ivan Tunez in 1998.
They've been together for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if he was his newborn child, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
You've recently found a new acquaintance.
Her choice was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousam.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little César lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to get a job, she stayed with her little partner, who even came to see her for a week in Palma.
However, from the content of her communication it is obvious that the relationship has broken up.
In March 2008 he's alone at Menorce and he says, "Alberto's kind of angry that I went to work."
"When I told him it seemed good to him, but now he realizes he must be with a little all day and can't do what he wants."
Then she's talking about the text message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address I'm sending you."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving a little girl with my mother, I'll take him when I get back," he says.
in May she talks about her return to her apartment: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only going to stay until 19, because 20 I have to go for work so I don't get lost."
He explains that if everything goes well, he will take his son to himself.
"He will be with whom he is to be with me, and he will never again in his life that I would leave him with someone other than my mother," doubting her bad relationship.
There's another contribution in July.
When this report is being run out, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered 10, is already dead.
"Cesar's satisfied on one side, but not on the other."
"He's with me on the one hand, and he likes it very much here, but he goes to school almost every day."
They're talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He'll go to summer school, and I'll save some money for the baby."
Seventeenth Greetings and Complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says I don't know what video he's sending you to email, look how he wants to, he's meeting with me, he needs sex."
Thirty-one more news: "The boy is doing well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also a report about Victor, the current partner: "He's giving me money."
On the internet are Monika's contributions to the blogs dedicated to anime and man.
She even had her own at MySpace, now revised, where she let herself be called "Muki ex-prisoner."
"Teror after the Galician (Motto)."
The last man to live with, the guard, expresses his pity and feels guilty.
He doesn't want to believe everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a free mother.
Monica entered the Provincial Ministry in Palma yesterday, where she came from the center of the county of Menorce.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said that the defendant does not remember how everything happened and that "she didn't mean to hurt a little bit".
Before that, however, she admitted that she had drowned Caesar in the bath and had his body in her pocket.
The defense and the prosecutor are asking for a psychiatric investigation.
People would get 4 seats and PSC in the Snow Room (Socialist Party of Catalan - late July) would lose 9 mandates
with the results of November 28th, the PP party could have the main word at the councillors in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes obtained and the number of experienced Members during recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Catalánska Lidó pån - czkl.) already has an idea of the general elections, whether or not they have been raised, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in the national elections is usually one such opposite to the Catalan elections.
in 2008, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in general, while this number was only 316,222 in the 2006 autonomous elections.
Last week she received a PPC (Catalan Lidova) 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of PP voters, were maintained, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were to take place, the PPC could obtain 12 MPs in the Chamber against the current 8th side of the CU (Convergence and Union, Czech Shoda and the Union - at the latest - would also receive 4 mandates (now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalan has fundamental importance for the parties PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this People's Analysis, the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalan - late May) would lose one MP - now has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalan - late May May 2013) would still have one mandate, possibly another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest delivery will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the general elections, where people who decide to influence the end of the socialist rule in four main provincial cities and also changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the most anticipated administrative budgets - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and peoples agree with the possibility that PSC could lose counsellors in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not receive the majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, parties of the ERC and ICV.
In view of the debate of the Republicans, it would not be possible for this party to lose its representation in Barcelona's representation - since it is necessary to obtain at least 5% of the votes.
The PP increased the number of votes obtained in four major cities and could have a decisive impact in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a key role in turning in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP received only 500 votes more than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The people also won other important councils such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
Currently, the PP has 34 councillors in Catalan and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell provided the Al-Qaida organization with thousands of passports
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian who were detained agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, which established travel passports to various groups of Al-Qaeda, including "Tigers of the Liberation of Tamil Ilam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", where the second group was the author of the assassinations in Bombay, where 106 people were killed in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to investigating this matter, aims to ensure through "Operation Kampai" the weakening of Al-Kaida's counterfeiting apparatus at international level and "restricting its operational capabilities".
Researchers estimate that during the two years that this cell was active in Catalan, it was possible to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then smuggled and then delivered to groups forming the criminal galaxy of the Al-Qaeda organization, so that their "bodiers" could travel freely across the borders of Europe and other Western countries.
This fragmented cell was not the only active one that had a jihad network in Europe, and therefore these investigations other than Thai services also participated in other European police units, and it cannot therefore be excluded that in the following days there will be no similar attacks in other European countries, as in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Ashar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigeria Babatunde Agunbiade) further developed in Thailand, with Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeesan Ehsan Butt and Thai Siriklaya Kijbumrung.
It was these men who drove a cell from Bangkok living in Spain and elsewhere in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was abolished in 2009, in particular stole travel passports from tourists who met the requirements of the Islamics.
This means that the documents had to belong to men between the ages of 25 and 45, had to have been valid for several years and had to be without designated visas.
The investigation documents emphasise that no facts are known so far that it would connect the detainees from Catalonia with the bombing in Bombay, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be noted that a few days before the assassination, some $1,000 was sent from the Catalan transmission agency, which was "inserted" to buy tickets to mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command", who killed 106 people.
The police have already had a lot of evidence.
Human Party (PP) requires Mass to suspend fiscal agreement
The president of the PPC (Catalan's Lid side) Alicia Sánchezý-Camachová had yesterday the opportunity to personally present to Arthur Mass his conditions for which he was willing to support his introduction into the role of President of the Generalitat; these conditions were consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority was to revive the economy and to reject ventures such as the economic agreement that the leader of the nationalists wanted to propose during his mandate.
The president of the Catalan peoples went to the meeting with Arthur Mass with 18 Members of the elections last week, which is more than satisfactory for the form, so the CIU candidate needs at least one formation of the creative opposition to abstain from voting on his arrival at the office.
It may depend on future alliances with the PP that nationalists in Snow White would like to maintain when general elections are held, but discussions that are still taking place in these days with the rest of the political leaders are carried out in the Catalan spirit.
With regard to President PP, in order to get her support for the introduction of the function, "it will have to end with all the over- and free-trade speeches", as well as with the economic agreement - similar to that of Basicka - which CU leader even wanted to put to the vote in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to desecrate the overcrowded political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Mass entry into function will be held within the framework of PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a strong opposition, Joan Herrero (ICV), and today he meets Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert River (Citudadans) and Joan Laporto (Solidarita Catalana).
The manager of the geriatric device ensures that there has been no death as a result of "inadequate measures"
The performance of the Olot Centre does not exclude their guardian killed more than 11 clients
The management of the Geriatric Centre La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to resolve the damage caused by the criminal behavior institution Joan Vila Dilmé, a caregiver who - while employed here - killed at least eleven seniors in care.
The director of this home for seniors Joan Sala delivered himself in the escort of a lawyer, Joan Canady, and announced that "the desire of the home of La Caritat would be able to bring charges against the guilty person" to the responsible murder, but "the legality and responsibility compel us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage of a good name that this institution may suffer because it has not discovered criminal activities of the guardian in time, the great threat to La Caritat's home is now the requirements for significant damages that are already being calculated by the legal representatives of the other families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had occurred in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of clients at home for seniors, with suspicion that in many cases he did not see a dead doctor personally, but that, given the age and poor health of patients, everything was fixed on the phone.
La Caritat yesterday, through its director, resolutely rejected this restriction and stressed that "the lack of measures could in no way have been the cause of what happened".
Legal representative La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party would be allowed a doubt other than his own accused person".
The man now named "The Angel of Death" confessed yesterday 11 deaths and stated that the first crime was allowed on 29 August 2009 and that he killed the second elder a month and a half later.
in this case, death caused by too high insulin doses, unlike the first time he used a mixture of calming tablets.
The Director of La Caritat stated that it is difficult to control staff access to medicines.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives were likely in six cases of the nine means used by this caregiver to kill patients in an attempt to relieve them from suffering.
However, the analysis that is now being carried out in the laboratory should show whether Vila was lying and actually looking for his first victim less cruel death or killed him by using a lie, as he already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat they do not believe in a medical claim and do not rule out that the number of people killed may be higher than the number he confessed to, and justify his conduct in the various versions that he gave to Villa with the knowledge that he had to change his conduct when it came out that he killed eight people.
They therefore say that they want justice available to be enlightened by the full extent of this matter.
The European Central Bank is in danger
yesterday's investors reacted quickly to yesterday's threat by President Trichet of the European Central Bank, who pointed out that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The border differentials were closed by force and the European Bank's share decreased by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to wrong - the euro is just above its critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of an unliquidated market that, although it is declining, recovers - but thanks to a short and very speculative position.
The investor will take some time before he loses his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank was urging us to take back the liquidity situation today, and tomorrow we will have to withdraw the quarter for two years.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the State debt recovery plan for the inefficiency and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within a period of one week and leave unrestricted access only for a period of one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity level to predict "minimumly in March" and comply with a three-month tender with unlimited access to the end of this quarter to guarantee liquidity at least by June.
We also hope that they will continue in their debt purchase programme and that they will even announce its intensification.
If the created expectation does not meet, it creates a new reaction from yesterday's markets, and even if they continue blind to the level of liquidity, God is with us!
It was the same in May, where they claimed they didn't even consider buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets - tomorrow the story could be repeated.
The European Central Bank must be credible and sustainable.
In May, she announced it on Monday, and on Wednesday, she announced that she had already bought a lot of them, which led to another collapse of the market.
Yesterday's invitation to switch for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro has spent only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting a change in the mood on the market, followed by Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures represent the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Estimates represent about 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be settled.
Although Ireland has no credibility after the problem has not been detected by stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable within the framework of the aid plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get Parliament's approval of the new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so in Ireland there will still be some uncertainty.
Angela Merkel calmed down her speech to relieve tension in the face of the next EU summit held on 14 December, which calls for a political compromise that would show that we are the Union and that we are all on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the others prefer Beethoven's Oda to be happy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to revitalize employment - it sounds like four years from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Tricheta and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock exchange grew by 4.5%, i.e. twice as much as the other European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Banks was rapid and convincing - we are heavily affected by the effect of surprise.
Today we have a key bid for three years, which will be favoured by the effect of Trichet, which, hopefully, will be a big demand for it, which will help resolve our doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Requesting a rescue plan would be for Spain to sacrifice itself.
They would give us the cash we don't need - in El Tesoro there are 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - high rates and market access would close us up.
However, it is still necessary to use Caesar's wife's strategy - "not to be that way, but to seem that way".
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen Group will attack the Vega Sicilia conference requested by his children
Storms in the open conflict in the family of the Álvarezs, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, are not true.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack after he considered it "very insignificant", the legal proceedings of El Enebro scheduled for 16 this month and required five of his seven descendants, who should try to excite most of them and strengthen themselves with the administrative authorities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and Maria José are arranging a legal group for a new chapter of their dispute over the control of part of society.
The founder of the largest holding of business services does not seem to be willing to settle in his dispute about membership in the ruling authorities of the El Enebro group.
Five of its seven descendants, who were appointed to serve as predecessors during the meeting of shareholders on 18 January of this year and whose objection is raised in the Commercial Register.
The trial of the El Enebro group scheduled for the sixteenth of this month, which was invited by the Official of the Commercial Court number 2 in Madrid, restored the burial of the family of the Álvarez.
The appeal to the judge is until the dispute is resolved by the only legal means which ensures that the Commission is convened.
The last step by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira of the Álvarez Mesquirizians is seen by David Álvarez as "a desperate means of his five children serving with the help of the judiciary and a clear legal deception to strengthen and improve the 18th January negotiations, which was completely void".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal attack of this act as "very insignificant".
The sole protagonists who discreetly silenced themselves have already tried without success to call the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls the seven descendants of David Álvarz 100% capital.
However, the founder of the group is required by family protocols to use 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide on when the matter of the court-martial attack has been resolved. The date of this recalculation has not yet been determined.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapons from Siemens
Software proposes improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the options of this new incoming team, and despite the rising trend of recent times, all were betting on the Ferrari Fernando Alons triumph.
Without us wanting to reduce the ability of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, the world Formula 1 has born a legend - the "secret weapon", which the multinational Siemens has put into the hand of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is an executive software simulating the routes that the German company launched on the market in 2007 for the purposes of very remote car sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, has been used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in energy plants and for devices with high precision.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon camera, the Sukhoi aircraft or the most popular commercial vehicles of the Nissan brand.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this software has enabled the Red Bull team to carry out "in a few hours, in almost real time" modifications and improvements that otherwise are detected during the race and trial.
Russwurm says that in 1992 they employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to carry out a maximum of three or four improvements during one period.
The Red Bull team is currently working on 180 highly qualified professionals equipped with executive information technology who analyse and propose any type of vehicle modification.
The leader of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of the Red Bull racing vehicles except for the engine that Renault fully responds to.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are being modified.
Changes can be translated from virtual reality into reality for less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical capacity is the amount of $40 million which represents the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has created about 50 km from London’s peak technology race to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings where I have limited access to visit - especially to journalists.
Everything that's being played here is considered a "great secret."
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people including two pilots - the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's hero is no doubt a fresh Sebastian Vettel champion in Formula 1.
However, other protagonists, whose aid is invaluable and who are unknown, are hidden from the disproportionate technological means that have been introduced into their participation in the competition circles.
The head of production technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in vehicle research and development contributed to a 50% victory and the rest was worthy of drivers.
At present, this ratio has changed and technology is expected to succeed by 85%, while pilots contribute by 15%.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP creates its own shops in cooperation with local distributors over two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with his trading partner Pon Reyes yesterday celebrated its first exclusive sale in Barcelona.
This company will be the first of 20 shops in the range of 80 to 100 m2, which this transnational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These shops will also be located in 16 existing business homes such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte English.
Spanish Vice-President HP Helena Herrerová pointed out as an example of a newly rebuilt sale to Barcelona's Gran Vía, belonging to Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company planned to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2013, including 20 Spanish shops.
The first sales were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the trade in Barcelona is the third.
Herrner did not want to reveal where other shops would be opened, however she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herber, who also runs HP personal systems, has ensured that the philosophy of opening up businesses will remain the same - with the use of local distributors who have the expertise and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises with the exclusive design of equipment for sale (with products that can be tested on an interactive basis), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also involved in providing business staff.
Helena Herrer said it would be franchising, and stressed that the exclusive network sold is aimed "to improve customer service, services for small and medium-sized enterprises in the purchase, service, indigenous service and even packaging".
Trade in Barcelona is part of a global pioneer programme aimed at solving any problems with computers in guarantee.
Online service is connected to the technical centre of the residents of Maastricht (Netherlands).
"Then we'll be able to solve the problems that can last up to two days in 10 minutes."
"This system is specially designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and for regular customers, as large companies already have a contractual service of technical assistance," Helen Herrer said yesterday.
Sabadell bets that he'll steal for three years to his competitors millions of customers
More optimistic than other bosses, a member of Banco Sabadell's Board of Bank, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be difficult for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
However, it includes a reduction in interest rates, which will try to compensate for the lowering of bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to be able to get a million private clients over three years.
Sabadell found the way to use the next three years and the power to survive in difficult economic conditions.
In 2011, the Bank will launch a new strategic plan with a validity of three years.
The aim is, in addition to surviving without having to turn to public aid in the Frob, to get a market share of millions of new private customers - and 700,000, respectively, if those who leave the bank - because until now the constitution has been more prone to small and medium-sized enterprises and large enterprises than small customers.
This year the bank has already received 250,000 private clients and 50,000 companies.
Its market share is 3.5% for private customers, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or it can also be said to be cautious, in order to reduce the costs that the bank will face when presenting the results during the period.
Numerous banking institutions are at this time reluctant to set goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of global banking.
Sabadell this year closes his Optima programme, set four years ago, although originally for three years, but the situation on the markets required expansion for another period.
Customers who leave the fire department will be their main target group.
At the meeting organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "hard and very important".
It is believed that the journey from the crisis in Spain "will be prolonged".
In addition, in two or three years 'very difficult to create employment', which is crucial for the survival of the banking sector.
And although they believe that the passive war - which reduces margins - is declining, the price of collateral for the risk that banks and brokers pay for their emissions to receive liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, which compensates for the reduction of margins.
"The topic of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a burden on loans".
"We haven't closed the rockets yet, but the differentials are very high," said the Guardian.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and to increase differential prices - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "now is a reduction in commissions", but here is a "competition framework".
The Sabadell Bank's strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as a general rule the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It does not guarantee free of charge that in Spain "there will be a need for larger sizes".
"Next year won't be left on stone," he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are "very reduced" and does not exclude some Spanish institutions from entering among the red numbers.
It points out that Frob can market the collection of funds before new capital measures.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remains a serious problem what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It means that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to obtain short-term financing using repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of fusion burner
Yesterday, the Director-General of CECA refused that another wave of fusion should occur and continued at the rate of reorganisation of the sector.
When he started the process of bringing together Spanish proponents, there were several institutions that ensured that this first phase was not involved and waited for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled yesterday that there should be a new wave of these operations.
"I believe that most mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Civic group cannot be regarded as the second round, what is happening are conventions."
"Most have been fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already ready and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has worked very well on this issue," said the director.
In his statements at the Adea meeting (Association of Leaders and Executive Officers of Aragon - p.a.) Olavarrieta ruled out that the concentration process is being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as shown in the payments that have appeared in business plans with the Spanish National Bank in its time, not now," he stressed.
"From 45 partners with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, thus reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be larger and thus falling in line with the Basel Treaty," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not too many happy views on the weakness of the process," which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding", because "what the Spanish National Bank does is to remind us that we must be in time before the end of the year".
CECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured Spain that it had the most attractive financial system across Europe and "probably" even in the world, and to those who doubt it, he added "the lack of knowledge".
The Director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" with regard to financial institutions and a system that has managed the "very important" concentration process and continues the "highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking was very good from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and Red German Line
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but laid down conditions for the Union as a whole.
The tension on the markets provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed a new adaptation measure, from the reduction of taxes on small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private brokerage agencies or the cancellation of EUR 426 for unemployed without a dose, until after the privatisation of 49% AENA (Spain airport and air traffic management – late), the airport manager Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, with the support of former Prime Minister Felip González, Vice-President Elena Salgadová joined criticism at the address of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility for the resolution of the current crisis.
How do we interpret this movement?
It has been said in advance that Merkel's opinion is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future will be, which affects the idea of observing the old traditions which are held by a large part of the other members.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible pathways from the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, part of which would be Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the return to March - although it can now appear as a scifi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option is based on the German proposals for recasting the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary constraints, fines for the provinces, possible delays in payments for some of them, and the extension of possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for some time, so there is no space for the exits now.
First, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission caused deficits in 2009, the German government has withdrawn constitutional reform from the grip to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a dispute between what Germany considered to be right (the fiscal constraints and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, did.
The second showed this Central European country when Merkel painfully extended the decision on Greece's rescue.
It has already been a subject of severe criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion which was also published was strongly against Greece's rescue.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel once again came up with a clear opinion when she called for the reform of the European Union Conventions in such a way as to allow the rescue of a Member State and at the same time for private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European because it accelerated the Irish crisis and all others.
However, its proposal, although somewhat simplified, has been approved and we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should allow these measures since 2013.
Germany has reached a red line that will not be crossed.
And he tells all of us that, although it is now necessary to take measures that are probably not too consistent, this data will end with the old functioning of the euro.
In 2013, it will represent the birth of a new currency zone in which states violating the rules will be severely penalised and may be forced to declare the suspension of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany suggests that we need to make a rigorous path of growth with increased savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on demand and construction, with huge imbalances in the balance of payments, which governments in the years booming Spanish growth simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we would have made a mistake if we didn't understand.
It is not only necessary to restore the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want for us is much harder.
And the worst part is that under these conditions, we could happen to be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these present turbulence will bring greater peace.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities they give us by spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his two statements (reforms promised after meeting with large businesses from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggest that, through criticism of Merkelov's address, the way of thinking that things should be put in order.
But the red line that Germany pulled out is here, and it doesn't seem to want to move with her.
And from the possibilities that can be considered, leaving the eurozone cannot be excluded from the full range of serious countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sports and handling of rules
The Finns, led by Alonso and Ramos in the fight with Ajax, never show the intent of avoiding punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabiho Alons and Sergia Ramose) from the League of Champions against Ajax on 23 November led to the writing of the sea of a record on whether or not this is non-sportable behaviour, and whether UEFA should punish both footballers.
It is known that a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won) appointed players lost their time after the other intentionally lost the time when it was necessary to play the faul to provoke the judge, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will complete the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - and Real Madrid will end in its group in the front - and will be able to continue to the next stage.
Finally, UEFA’s disciplinary commission sentenced coach José Mourinh to two matches and the provincial players received a fine.
Producing a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more common in football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the etous football, that is, rules that are not written, but they follow.
The part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that her participant was a team of Real Madrid (which in its hymn boasted glory and honor, and has already been tempted for similar acts by its players), and, as it seems, also thanks to the dramatization led by Maurinhem, who thus adds to his long history of the commodante and the provocator of another episode.
In any event, the debate is about whether this kind of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether in these circumstances rights are respected; it is therefore about actions that respect the rules of sport which, however, seem to be trying to circumvent.
It is decided what kind of harm such a behavior will affect the sports spirit.
One of the advantages of sports behavior is the physical integrity of opponents who have not been violated in these cases, or have not come to a violent game.
Another of these features of a clean game is to avoid the fact that the players have an advantage over the team of opponents, which has not come here either.
So paradoxical about the action of Real Madrid players is the fact that there has not been anything that we normally characterise as a rod or a law enforcement, there has not been a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behaviour should be the most visible in order to receive punishment.
They waited and enjoyed the punishment.
The next question, however, is what benefit the guilty will have from their deliberate transgression.
It is necessary to note here that the opponent is not in a disadvantageous position and that there is no benefit in the current match because the obvious result is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not even a useful strategy for another match because the club won't be able to count with these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players will start another phase of the League of Masters without cards that could threaten their participation in the future match.
However, it is an advantage from the long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so at first glance the team can be eliminated, and in addition to this, players will be punished and will move to the second round of tickets, where only one card will be excluded from the first round.
So as the wheels continue, it won't be clear if it's an advantage.
In short and well, these negotiations do not go against the sports spirit, which is part of a strategic decision that allows maximum benefit under the rules.
in the case we deal with here, the players were not meant to avoid the award of punishment (which would be a clear case of handling the rules), but rather chose when to subjugate.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding punishment or fleeing from it.
Although there is no clear margin between the nature and the conduct of the rules, I believe that in this case clearly it was a type.
It seems to me that controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the instructions were transmitted to them to provoke them from leadership.
The damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fighting offers for Christmas parties in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year on the wine reservations on 16 and 17 December.
There is a fast-track event for self-employed people who want to lose between 20 and 30 euros.
As well as the Turkish Med or Lottery, with the arrival of December, pre-necessary parties, which continue to act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and facilities for free time in Barcelona, but due to the crisis, they have stopped fighting for customers by reducing prices: almost everyone wants to lose 20 to 30 euros for food, the business and associations in this sector agree.
To complete the complexity of the numbers, the calendar concentrated this year (when St. Peter's day came on Friday) on a week from December 13th, which resulted in a vina booking days at the peak (16th and 17th), while there was almost no operation in the previous week.
As has happened since 2008 when the dead years began, there are many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to give up traditions, many employees pay for their own pocket party.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices on the edge of pregnancy, the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restauracion de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
A representative of the patronage of restaurant facilities is not dare to predict what will be celebrated this month.
"People will think well before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but as far as prices are concerned, they're careful," he adds.
Trades will go well with those "who offer quality and good service at a favourable price", he says and recalls that as a result of the crisis, customers tend to go down and most customers now want to lose around 25 euros.
The research in various facilities shows that the biggest effort for booking requests is on the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group announces a genuine boom reservation this Friday, with the most requirements for losses of up to EUR 30, which have led to a menu offering total prices of between EUR 25 and EUR 30.
In another significant company, Andilana, which is located in 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al.), has brought the speciality of this year's calendar of more time reservations, which has been in effect since the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menu, which should be chosen by everyone, moves from €19.95 to €30," they say.
In the AN Group, which belongs to El Mussol, Attic, Quu and a total of 23 companies, there are optimistic after they have seen a rise in profits since the second half and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas markets.
The sources of this company stress that December 18 will also be a difficult day, as pre-hospital celebrations will take place between friends.
they added the Christmas menu to their six group menu, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they noted in comparison with last year's guests' trend to lose 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish forest wine - late).
They also noticed that companies are already appearing, calling their employees again, and it seems that the size of the groups is something bigger.
The Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Bar Association, Restaurant and Leisure Centre in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he begins to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of bookings is "lived", even though the customers "opportunity to maximum".
Even during the Christmas celebrations, this notion did not come to the fore, so that the payer would point out.
Pakistan's nuclear program gave birth to a major unrest in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons "faster than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the United States embassies in Pakistan and the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published by Wikileaks, confirms the extraordinary unrest that provokes the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
In addition to the explanatory and significant details that offer about the content of communication and the thinking of North American diplomats in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states, in terms of nuclear security, instead of increasing itself, is "to retreat", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The speciality of the Pakistan nuclear programme - that its weapons are not disarmed, but agree on parts to facilitate their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's awakening.
This is calculated by the Ambassador in Pakistan by Anne W. Patterson in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under control of the Taliban, the alleged proliferation of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and with a program of controlled shootings is not only seen in the United States, but also in Russia, as a growing and significant reason to be alert.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with strong religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or programmes of controlled shootings," said an expert from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their US counterparts.
The latest documentation published by Julian Assange's server is further the lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
The letter issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", says: "Transparency often does not exist; offers of help remain unresponse or are rejected".
in another report Peter Lavoy, a national news service worker for South Asia, notes that "even in the face of economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world".
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to "explain very well" during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayanicho's chief army, that "the Pakistani army must end with the silent support of terrorist groups".
Hon to Chief Wikileaks
Obama appoints a highly established employee responsible for combating terrorism to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" to track and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it's hard to be sure of facts.
Interpol announced yesterday the "extraordinary challenge", i.e. the order of notice, to "localize and monitor the movement" of Assange.
However, it is not a classic detention order.
Besides, this challenge isn't new, but it's dated November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the last escape of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse that Australia is facing in Sweden.
In addition, he assures the legal representative of author Wikileaks Mark Stephens that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assang".
It was November 20th, when the international police assembly in French Lyon issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when he received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions for the identification or location of Assange "in order to place a temporary link on it and issue it".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of persons concerned with a red challenge, many Member States, as explained by the organisation, consider the so-called red notice to be an enabling arrest - this must be secured by the national police component - especially in cases where the Member States have a bilateral agreement on the issuance of detainees, such as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange should probably be located.
This step has exacerbated Assenge's lawyers, who published the writings yesterday, declaring that the nineties-year-old founder Wikileaks was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities through videoconferencing.
They also remind that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the legendary Lavrenti Pavlović Berijou, head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal pursuit," says the letter.
While the whole world is looking for it - and his mother from Australia protects the innocence of her son - Assange is still in an unknown place, yet not silent.
On Monday, he provided Skype with an interview from an unknown location to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine - in this interview he requested a delegation from the foreign ministry of the United States of America to Hillary Clinton.
"If it turned out that it was responsible for the US diplomats' order to perform espionage in the United Nations and violate international conventions that the United States had signed, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the press spokesman of the White House Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for demise as "silly and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who operates the website," he told CNN.
Obama alone commissioned a highly established employee responsible for the fight against terrorism, Rusella Traverse, to ban other document escapes.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop adding Assange's importance is contrasting with the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators today.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will be chairing the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber since January, asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organisations "in order to strike and sue anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise to help them".
He went further to Tom Flanagan, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's adviser, who said that Assange should be "killed", which he subsequently had to call off.
"Both should write him a reward or use an unmanned plane or something."
Whoever didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas, and possible candidate for president.
"Whoever will be in government, who is responsible for the leak of information, has admitted treason and any punishment other than correction would be too modest," said Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for a "dark" in the ERC on the Carod trailer
The Republican leader will allow the parties to vote in secret on their suspension.
Huguet proposes more plural execution and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós evidently found a recipe for fighting an already several internal revolution in the ranks of the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalan - late January), which is unconcerned about the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture with regard to demise seems to be insufficient to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluíse Caroda-Roviry, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weak as his own leader, and that he cannot absolutely care about other neglected flows.
That's why Levice's going to try to get some new criticisms from the blackout that will help him turn to the general election.
First of all, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to speak in secret for its suspension.
By means of ballot cards, not by raising hands.
If Carod's supporters wish to give the president a criminal vote, they will be able to do so without fear of legal measures.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the breakdown and detail of his person.
in a few discussions he claimed not to consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added, without clarifying the percentage, that it would also not be a good result "after Bulgarian".
The Coroda officials demand more from the President than to make their function available - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, because Puigcercós has the largest authority at the meetings.
But since they do not have the majority enough to expel demise, they will try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
This is why they are expected to participate in the preparation of a document on strategic reorientation, which will be put to the vote on the 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercóse's exchange of this promise to move the congress already in the fall of 2011.
The leader of the ERC stated that "majority" is damaging stability and that its goal is to enable the organisation to wash its dirty laundry at closed doors once and for all.
in this context there seems to be a remarkable article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After considering Puigcercós' ideologist, this innovation advisor took the final point that the leader would be confirmed "for several purposes".
And he appointed five of them, two of whom were to be saved.
The first is the "recomposition" of executives to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means to include new faces that are from the Carod sector.
The second goal could be a big news item.
Huguet proposes that the ERC complete the meeting as a mechanism of operation.
And so it fights for state reform so that congresses can be held through elected delegates.
The end of the meeting system model, the exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction at two last sessions.
However, the 2008 meeting decided that the meeting should be considered at a special congress on state reform.
This matter is still unresolved, as the situation within the party has reflected a solution to this matter.
Now, without growing critical sectors, it might be appropriate to take care of this matter again and try to close it once and for all.
23 killed in November; 390 in 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico reported a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than in the previous month, as Milenio reported.
Among the murders are the cases of three women and a few separate bodies found in Mexico City.
In Mexico, 390 deaths are reported in the previous month, probably linked to organised crime.
Among the cases is the finding of dead bodies in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitán, in the period Toluca.
The victim had at least three gunshot wounds, another one from love into her head and had hands and legs tied with a rope.
The next day the body was found in the trunk, which was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle over the street Mixtecas, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the Naucalpan period.
Early in the morning on Thursday 4 November, the body was found to bear the mark of torture and at least three lethal shots to the chest at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal road during the period Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a report signed by probably criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nezahualcoyotl, a 50 - year - old man was killed by eight shots after he left his home and wanted to start collecting waste.
On November 7, two victims were shot in the head at the age of 30 in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, in the Ecatepec period.
in Chalco was on a long way in the colony of El Naranjo found the dead man shot in the forehead, and underneath the body was found a cartridge with a gun of calibre 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the canal of waste water in the colony Playa Golondrina.
The life-savings carried out a thorough search for other parts of it, however, they did not find them.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlán reported the discovery of a body with hands tied back and wrapped head in Pena Colorado.
A man had a gun wound on his cover.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were packed in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda during the period Atizapán de Zaragoza was also reported to the victim.
The day later was found in the colony of Valle de los Reyes in the period Los Reyes La Paz cardboard box containing human head.
in the nearby colony there was a residue of the body packed in a black plastic bag, reported by El Incorrigible.
On the seventeenth, two dead women were found wrapped in bed linen in the settlement of Zoquiapan during the period of Ixtapaluca, and the second morning in Huixquilucan was found dead men packed in a yellow-blue stretcher, which was previously reported by the killers left at his body identified as Mario Ríos.
In Ixtapaluca there was a woman found in the village of San Francisco Acuautla with no sign of life with two wounds to the skull.
The woman's skin was exposed to the tattoo of Santa Muerte's sacred character (word "Holy Death" - later on) and also to her necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group was found in Zinacantepec in the car.
Two days later, the bodies of two men who had their head covered with a belt were found, and a report was also received from them, in the municipality of Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victim's report was probably one of the criminal organizations in which it said, "This will happen to those who are not fit."
In Ecatepec there were two bodies that bore the mark after torture and had tied ends, inside a taxi left behind the Centre of Justice in the colony of San Agustín.
The last day of the month were found the remains of two men in the periods of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first one was found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was packed into black plastic bags, bound with a tape and had a continuous message; while the second one was slammed and found in plastic packaging in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together with him, they found agents and notes with a message.
China complies with its objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Change COP16 ensured that its country had made an extraordinary effort to reduce the carbon rate, and stated that it was on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 % to 45 % by 2020.
China will abide by its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 40% and 45% in 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of this country at the UN Climate Change Conference.
In his first public speech at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei ensured that his country had made an unmistakable effort to reduce the carbon footprint and change its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million over the last four years in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he realized that China would not change its objectives and would continue to work with the international community on this matter.
He referred to the fact that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these points, progress has already been made, including the last adoption of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.
He further stressed that in China, the federal authorities cooperated in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their objectives with regard to energy savings, energy efficiency and emissions reduction.
Furthermore, according to the report, various plans have already been completed, which are financed by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
For example, it is said that the Programme for the Effective Use of Energy, which has been introduced over the last five years, has received investment from the UN, the government and private initiatives.
The provincial project of climate change is also under way, further the project of exchange of lamps for light bulbs and the project of mitigation and adaptation, clarified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's expert adviser on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than they generally thought.
For example, it worked out that greenhouse gas emissions per capita are 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts with regard to energy use - for example, it has increased 20% energy efficiency over the last five years and expects further progress to be made by 2020.
Entitled to exclude Espina: César Nava
The National President of the PAN Party (Partido Action Nacional, Czech National Action Party - ) stated that the former President of this Party is entitled to apply to the National Ordinance Commission.
The national president of the PAN party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espiny Barrientose was authorized and that the former president of this party was entitled to refer to the National Order Commission and claim his rights.
In the hearing held before the opposition of the Governor of Gabon Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espina is in any event a decision taken at local level.
"It is the autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to refer in his case by means of a complaint to the National Council Order Commission for a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that it is now not time to think about 2012 and that it has never been at the negotiating table on the presidential candidacy of the Alliance.
Nava Vázquez has expressed his conviction that the PAN will come from the internal elections of 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a theme that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, it was the goal for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
President PAN said that his side is 71 years of dialogue, and therefore he added, "We do not treat internal competition, rather we weigh and strengthen it".
He said that the Committee could choose, without debate, the best president or the president who deserves the next three years of the PAN, so he handed over the staff to the "who the Committee determines".
"So I'm absolutely calm and relaxed, any of those five with pride I'll hand over to the president of the party."
He predicted that the rise that the party recorded in the last July elections would be reflected in future clans, although "not yet time to think for 2012".
"Now there is a need to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, which have the roots in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, because "many expectations and charges are put into them, and I am sure that Gabino is worthy of these expectations".
When we asked her about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institutionale, Czech Revolucional Institutional Party, etc.) due to his four-year speeches, which he ruled, César Nava called on members of the PRI to think about the six-year periods of former presidents Ernest Zedilla and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
"If the Zedilla and Salinase governments in PRI think they were better than the Fox and Claderón rule, then they will start defending them, so that they leave their streets," he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during a demonstration in the National Auditorium, since there is no use of rubber or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes the law on Twitter to support students without documents
"If you think that the adoption of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and have to approve this law," tweeted the American president on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama, with a contribution today on his personal social network Twitter account, joined the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you think that the adoption of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and have this law approved," he tweeted.
His brief report draws attention to the Internet link to a comprehensive document that requires the public to immediately join the senators, as the vote on this law is approaching.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be recorded," he said.
The report was published after 42 republican senators were threatened by blocking the approval of any law unless the extension of the tax reduction from the Bush era and the financing of the government were approved.
Such blocking notified by a letter signed by 42 republican senators could affect voting on the Dream Act Act and other projects, such as ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other proposals, the President said that he believed that once a fiscal topic is resolved, a calendar could be drawn up for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that we will be able to reach agreements on this at some point and then be able to plan a series of other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the House, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would request a "conclusion vote" concerning the Dream Act, so that the proposal for legalization of students without documents could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although the most likely is next week.
The Senate's approval of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would legalise some 800 thousand young people who had arrived in the United States before the end of 16 years, have lived in the country for the last five years and have been admitted to the institution of higher education or army.
However, the stairs need to approve the 60-vote proposal, which requires the assistance of several Republicans, so the organisation of its supporters is carrying out intensive agitation in order to ensure the approval of this law.
Democratics, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, the members of the Dream Act project need to obtain a number of Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the republican senators most negotiated are Senators of Maine Olympia Snowew and Susan Collins, as well as the retired Senator of Florida George Lemieux, who supplemented Senator Mel Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they have told you that the next time they don't support it.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet expressed himself.
Although the Snowman representatives are attached to another version, according to most analysts, Dream Act will face the greatest obstacles in the Senate.

The second cycle The pleasure of the language was a promenade where participants presented a literary gala presentation
"I understand sex in the language, but... the finger to the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luis Valenzuelová, who was invited to start the second round Enjoying the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (on the other side of the table at the table, the theme of Sex in the language was explained).
The finger to the wound "brings us to the narrows", a popular Argentine writer told the audience, composed mostly of young people who met at the International Library Fair in Guadalajara to hear this debate at the cool table, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergia Ramírez, Mayry Montera and Luis García Montera.
Luisa Valenzuelová read the text that she had dedicated to Gonzal Celori and which Schultz then mentioned as a great story, in which Luis first appeared as a protagonist, who, in searching for the knowledge which is "morning" comes from a doctor, from which she does not get the answer, although the point of the same story is yes.
From an infectologist he goes on to say, "Perseverance is not my strong side, it may be my wound."
Finally, after frustration with the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the morning is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalytic who reveals the secret: "the morning is truly unfolded and thus symbolic is scar".
The protagonist was relieved and concluded that "on the morning she was able to find out only so much that she was really exposed to it and that it does not exist", but she was convinced that the delights and fears in the language must go hand in hand.
The writer of Valenzuel was playing with both.
Nicaragejec Sergio Ramírez also presented with a beautiful story called Praise for the invention, in which the finger is not named in the morning, but at one point it will appear.
with the elements of magical realism told about the famous wizard who played the dark, brought back the people who had gone far away, or corrected the honour that one lady had lost, this story, which then turned to speak America, a great novel, in which from the beginning his own chroniclers who had told it were not missing, and here is quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticises overtelling the merchants.
"Cervantes, who invented us all, laughed at finged witnesses who were presented in the stories as real, but in another way never managed to tell the story of America with such imagination as even lost the cold."
However, he stressed, "they are crazy and liars who have more fantasy" and just where the reality and lies lie, where they no longer know what the story belongs to one group and what the other reaches the fictitious literature of their peak.
It's actually called "cervanto tradition."
"Thanks to his link, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter pointed out and praised the variety of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with her Word of the Ring allowed for the wound.
The Cuban-portor writer showed her finger on the big wound of social violence that goes through her country - and shares it with Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs close a quiet compromise, which of course is not intended," she said after stating that the reality of literature is a communication and dimension of a compromise that is created between the author and readers - and in their "chemical reaction".
In the evening, Spanish poet Luis Garcia Montero, whose performance also emphasized "to this finger in the morning of the writer bound by the writer", closed.
He said that in the world that lives in haste, also in intellectual growth and control of consciousness that transcends dogmatism, it is forgotten that "no little is hidden for every attachment and every objection is also a small yes".
"To be gentlemen of our thoughts and reality we must color: and coloring means often to put our fingers into the wound and trouble those who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, black, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and also trouble the authorities who prefer this black and white world," he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano goes after his first title
Rubén Omar Romano is reading three defeats in the finals, during his career he experienced good and bad, but he was able to achieve it on three occasions on the decision-making series.
In the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, in addition to the thin two different styles of their techniques, teams that have a visible difference between each other in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano reads three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced good and bad, but he was able to achieve already on three occasions on the decisive series, but until now he left with the unarmed, and that is why this is an extraordinary opportunity for him.
The Argentine had to settle with the silver medal, remained a step for the winner, and was curiously playing with the same team following the finals.
The Santist strategy as a coach was reached into his first final at the Apertura 2002 tournament when he had in his hand the difficulty of the Morelia club, with which he suffered a total of 4-2 against Toluce; then in the 2003 Clausura tournament he returned to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
With Santos Laguna in the 2010 Tournament Tournament of the Tournament of Toluka, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against "Uzenářů" (another name of the club Deportivo Toluca – later translated) after 210 minutes of the game indefinitely 2-2, after a series of criminal shootings he got to the advantage of three on one and had two opportunities to secure a title, but at last his three players passed from 11 steps and so the team suffered turning to 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" from Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says he is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I'm bound, and the title would be of course for me, but the first is the most important," said the coach when he was assigned about the number that speaks in the finals against him.
in living memory has the previous finals, in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, "we have learned that until the end of the decision-making process, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as the players, because the past with the two penalties, we have already been ready to run out to celebrate, and I think that we have learned in this until the game is over, we cannot celebrate".
She is not concerned that this series could be decided in criminal killings, she believes to her players: "You never try to get to a series of criminal graves, you try to end up in normal times, but sometimes there is no other option and it is to be prepared for this, in the last tour we were ready, unfortunately but we are afraid of the wrong pull, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety that we felt when it was the title in our hands, but we lost it, it left us something and let us hope that this time it will not come to something like this."
Romano has a chance to stop being the second and to taste the first glory that titles bring.
United States changes rules for the provision of visas
People will have to turn to the Services Centre for visa applicants before consultation at the Consular Department; the costs will be lower and the waiting period will be reduced.
With effect from 10 January 2011, the visa negotiations at the United States Embassy and consulates will be amended.
with a new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to turn to the Visa Applicants Service Centre (as short as ASC) before the consultation at the Consular Division.
Staff from ASC shall receive the applicant's biometric information and they shall be assessed by the Consular Division before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of drawing up visas will be lower, no longer necessary to pay the fee for the meeting agreement, the second for processing the application and the other for the delivery of the transport service document.
The applicant shall pay only one fee, which shall cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to 140 dollars for tourist visas, 150 dollars for visa applications (including temporary staff visas) and 390 dollars for commercial and investor visas.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to complete the interview with the consular officer, but only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and receive fingerprints.
In view of the fact that biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who will request a second consultation with the Consular Division will spend a shorter period here than in the past.
Even so, those who will apply for a visa at consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an additional $26 fee.

NASA announcement of discovery of alien life
The U.S. Space Agency opened a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could lead to the discovery of alien life.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States announced tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock by an expert on astrobiology, a science that deals with study of origin, evolution, expansion and the future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited reporters, NASA made sure that it represented a "discovery that causes corruption in the search for extraterrestrial life", which sparked speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living under uninhabited conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and who might be the possibility of one of them becoming intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live are improved.
It seems to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in the Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life because the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creation of arsenic in some way uses it for its life, and this is precisely its ability to increase the likelihood that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that is on earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another, second form of life, different from what we know".
The Cosmic Agency will announce the real success of the findings at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference is attended by Pamela Conradová, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who is studying Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that his chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Coverage and Pattern bear the opposition "block"
Reforms of the Congress Law lead to the coming of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period was not yet started when the opposition bloc, led by PRD (Partido de la Revolutiono Democratá, Czech "Spana de Democratá", "Spana de Democratá", PT (Partido del Labora, Czech "Spana traba"), Convergencia (Czech "Shada"spana), and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalve, who declared himself independent, were discussing one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" to the Snow Hall.
Before the opening of the 60th parliamentary session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, by Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patron Montalvo "screaming" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, since it excludes them.
This reform, repeated, begins "bapartism", because it will now be two people from the same number of sides who will rule Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarito Santos Aquilara, the coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López of Britain by PAN (Partido Action, Czech National Action Party) and Luis Cárdenas Fonsecou as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms are institutionally creating political marginality from the back of the PRI side (Partido Revolutionaryo Institutional, Czech "Revolutional Institutional Party") and PAN.
He explained that during the following days they would speak to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they did not have it, they would be again detailed by these two parties, which ended the opposition coalition.
"When I come (opposite coalitions), I look at it because we are excluded from any decision, even not willing to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence stated that they are in agreement with PRD, PT and Patron and will therefore form a plurality group.
It is not possible to allow, he continued that the Congress, after being monopolized, was now "dubular".
Aspiration reform of the law is not that in Congress there is endless bipartisanism.
This group is beginning with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez gave.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza explained that the Congress at the time became "beneficial" two - in opposition to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was ruled by only one party, today it's divided by two."
Mr Montalvo asked that he respect the person of the MP to be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"In order that the five of us who are likely to be nine, but right now they see us in five, will not be left behind because of clandestine agreements, each of us in another group, we have agreed to find a place at the action table, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and approved, we stand outside, and we disagree with this reform."
Another 200 thousand pesos are issued for "additional"
Counsellors in Mazatlán will pay another check to the company's owner of the electricity supplier.
Another check for something more than 200 thousand pesos was sent to the councillors by Loreno Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
This amount paid in the second half of this year by the owner of the electricity supplier shall be paid out to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the Consultant's Transparency Page, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November of this year, was issued to 200,144,56 pesos and as its subject was referred to as "the settlement of unpaid payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the world will pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme Audit Office for sales at high prices, another volume.
What has not been said is the total amount still owed by the councillor, and how many checks will still be sent to the benefit of the Camach Palace.
"There was nothing bought now, only what we owe her, as well as other suppliers," he said in one interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, 2 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last 16 November.
Although this business has not yet been published in the Government's letter, as the law states in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the depositary has ensured that the services of the consultancy supplier have not been used again.
In the previous period, after 25 July, the Noroest magazine published a review of the checks submitted by its advisors to its suppliers, which revealed that in the period from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year period by the mayor of Jorge Abel López Sáncheze, paid the city of Camachová Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos by means of 42 checks.
This also carried out a transaction with Jumapam, where she was depositing checks on more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor state of Sanchez Taboady in Mazatlán.
After the fall of foreign tourism into the depths of Sanchez Taboady, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asks the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and do not show such a port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders in the Zone of Dorada, recalled that they repeatedly asked to take care of the concept of destination, and the wrong things the tourists here find to replace it with new activities or routes.
He pointed out that the poor street and walkers are affected by tourists who are passing through here and see a disorder, which adversely affects close businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close up for one day, and they don't have any idea of the markets they're avoiding, otherwise they wouldn't solve these issues for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused the lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the council.
"The workshop will have to take responsibility and prevent such a repetition, will have to devote itself to preventive maintenance, not only to correct existing problems," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area should be maintained, but as residents we deserve a clean dwelling, the councillor should change its city maintenance strategy."
Other places that seem neglected and poor are noted, such as the Mazatlán Emblem and El Venadito (monument, socha dejelena - czn. zkl.).
"Today, in order for tourists to arrive, it does not only depend on the promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, i.e. a city that flows with the purity of its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was no need for attention here, and these facts emphasize something that is well-known to all, lacks maintenance.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put in order in cooperation with the councillors, said that priority must be given to keeping the city clean and well to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of the Tourism Promotion, said that saving tourist sites in Mazatlán is indispensable because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and space, but it will need to be put in order first to attract these places and to bring them to the list we have to promote this destination."
IP requests for the results Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, would like the Members to take on great responsibility by setting an example in looking for a better Signalay in the various challenges they face.
The parliamentary period of full-time work and without agreement between the parties and the State Executive requires the business sector in Mazatlán because Sinaloa is failing in the cracks and is facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 from the PAN, three from the Party of Nueva Alliance, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergence and the last from the PVEM, comprising a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations for new members of Congress is that they will be able to carry out proper management, obligations towards companies and different areas requiring responsible legislative work, and that the same site and patronage patterns will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Coordinating Board of Enterprise (CCE), proposed that the newly elected 40 members of Congress take on heavy responsibility and serve as an example on the way to a better Signalou in the various challenges he is facing.
"We expect Members to really exercise their right, without agreement between the parties, because they usually take steps to promote their own interests and become the driving forces of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary groups."
He therefore spoke of the need to confirm the obligation to establish the necessary conclusion which would move the ruling forward by order.
"We want them to do a decent job and to be committed primarily to companies and sectors, because it was the people of Sinaloy who gave them their vote in the past elections of confidence."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives would be to collect all forces in an effort to achieve economic growth in the country because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to encourage economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support the creation of jobs in a certain way."
As far as travel is concerned, he asked that the new legislators give him greater weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is inappropriate in view of the importance of economic activity, bringing in currencies and investments that are also directly competing with agriculture."
In addition to spending funds on start-up tourist projects, Congress should help add the state to security and help with an alcohol law that failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
Looking for Three Kings
Dolls, cars and bikes are together with other toys on the list of children's wishes in the family of the Coronads Valenzuels.
For their parents, it will be difficult for the coming of the Three Kings to fulfill their ideas, since their home is about 12 people and one bereavement.
But Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest settlement in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, since the father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes it's hard because your husband's not lucky, but we're selling mandarins and potatoes... and I'm going out on the street with "sniffs" on the street this afternoon," said Cayettena Valenzuel andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a doll Barbie.
As for ten-year-old José Alfred, he'd like a "monster" car for some time now, and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesus, Cayettena would like to dress in size for one year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I'd like this monster car', but I told him 'we'll see his son', because it was very expensive," recalls Cayettean's sadness.
For older children who were just in school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, has a size of 12, ten-year-old Isaiah size 10, where eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is missing tennis, so he'd be a couple of sizes five and a half or six.
If you want to help fulfill the dreams of children from the Coronads Valenzuels family, you can participate in the "They Are Looking for Three Kings" campaign, and bring a gift or money in cash at Noroest's reception.
14 Supposed drug dealers arrested
A dozen visits were made in Austria, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for production and sale of the Indian rope.
Fourteen people were arrested and faced with various charges.
The visits took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that served to produce drugs.
"Approximately 750 steps of an Indian rope, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used for production were fun," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesperson for police in Quebec.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom are supposed to be heads of this network, two men from Sherbrook.
The detainees had to arrive at the courthouse in Sherbrook following their arrest.
They could face the accusation of the production of an Indian rope, its holding with the aim of trading with it, bribery and theft, among others.
These visits took place after a long investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that enabled us to join this arrest," said Mr. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 regional police officers investigating the city of Estrie State Police Quebec, State Police in Sherbrook and the Sherbrook Memphrémagog Police Administration.
Illicit migration will be able to continue without problems.
The proposal of the law of conservatives, which the government would have to regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will be clearly overcome , while all three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"Stand right on the side of the party that built a juule under your feet," said liberal chief Michael Ignatiff, surrounded by MPs after the week's Sunday du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, which would allow any person from a ship identified as a ship transporting illegal immigrants to hold up to one year would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
The head of the Quebec Blok, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill because he was pointing to the wrong goal.
"We are opposed and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD critic, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticism that they wanted her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree that we should take measures against illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider to be the bare part of another bill, C-35," Mrs Chow said.
"We do not support the proposal of the Conservatives' law because it sheds guilt on refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year," explained Mrs. Chow.
Minister for Immigration Jason Kenny accused the opposition parties.
"The Canadians collectively tell the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada as a man and treat it as a patholysis."
They expect Canada to take the necessary measures, Minister Kenny responded.
The government did not vote in confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
One Conservative said to the Agency QMI that the government would ask for a vote so that every opposer would respond from his position before his voters.
The new unit does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement that it is possible to establish a permanent unit for the fight against corruption and corruption, many observers continue to require the establishment of a public investigation commission for the issue.
Minister of Public Security Robert Dutil is trying not to forget this idea: Québec intends to consult the Department of Research from New York on this issue in January next year.
Metropolis has been a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement of one of us surprised us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Police Council in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil was present.
Moreover, it was not necessary for the criticism of public security, by PQ Stéphane Bergeron, to assess this announcement as "a rabbit pulled from the hat" and "amateric solution forged on the knee".
Minister Dutil himself replied to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the future of unity.
"He'll be satisfied with confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjeana Parenta, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness hearing in public recalculation.
"In addition, Mr. Charest insists that he does not want to create this investigative commission, and people think, like you and me, that he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only means to achieve the establishment of an investigative commission is demise Jean Charesta", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and politics in the Institute for the Education of High Officials.
In order to get out of this blind alley, he designed Quebec to give special powers to the Inspector General so that he could investigate corruption and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
It also feels that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners who allow people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in Charest's government records.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Criminal Code, so that it would be better adapted for this type of criminal activity.
This requirement would be based on the mandate for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), which informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marca Fournier that the caselaw of this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his fellow judge, Rob Nicholson, is just dealing with some of the amendments associated with this list.
In operation of Jaro 2001, which reached the bikers group, while the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the gangsterity Act.
Rivers under strict surveillance.
A number of water flows have been severely controlled due to strong rainfall that fell from Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon in Shawingan, Mauritius, there was a land crash.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
The evening came to another suture of land in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's broken.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, a number of regions were hit with a strong impact, i.e. from 40 to 70 millimetres.
From 20 to 40 more millimetres were not expected from today until Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The intersections on the north of the river and in the valley of Outauais were hit most.
It could fall up to 100 millimetres.
If we cut down these snowfalls in some sectors, we can be afraid of flooding in some water streams.
Quebec's rescue service announced on Wednesday the warning night against the danger of flooding for the Ouereau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Los Laurentides, and in Chene, in Lotbinière, became the subject of flood preparedness and uninterrupted control.
In the area of de Lanaudière, they caused severe collisions between certain lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixt, a one-way bridge was hit by strong rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated preventively.
In Outauouais some of the lakes of the coast caused the closure of some roads, especially in Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service has an emergency and is monitoring the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
Quebec Water Prediction Centre issued a warning centre against strong floods for several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouereau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec's voice moderator, Stéphane Dupont, has suffered a partial ill-treatment from the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) because of controversial statements concerning social assistance and the Haitians and, as well as because of gross expression during the broadcast.
The Radio and Television Council considers that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "unprecedented information about social assistance and inappropriate negative exclusion of the Haitians from gross expression which does not correspond to the broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussion on suicide, including the transmission of the names of the two persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules for the broadcast.
The Broadcasting and Broadcasting Council received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken after the complaint by the Joint Front of the beneficiaries of Quebec's social aid.
The group complained that the amounts indicated in the submission were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont felt that suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the report was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of the "Dubontic Southern Reports" have affected a sensitive topic in an unbiased and appropriate manner."
There was no exaltation against him.
The last dispute was about a statement that followed after the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort went into the media shooting that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator said he did not send a gift to help the Haitians, because we can't really know that the needed money will really get.
The Commission considers that these comments were not invalidated, but that their cumulative effect creates an improperly negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already opened my class store of that thing."
"My list has been intact for one and a half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use harsh statements.
In any case, CHOI-FM broadcasts cooperated "on the basis of their duties".
For a station which will have to notify, inter alia, this decision once during the main broadcast within a period of three days, the consequences are minimal.
King of the Kung-fuvà Montreal.
The inhabitants of Montreal, originating in Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, have an extremely special time.
An athlete who excels in "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickbox and Thai box enters the world's dads and rings and is looking for new challenges.
"I began with martial arts such as kung fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Earthmal, which has been living in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches a little bit everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and assistant to UPS, just gave his opponents a bad report when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I've won categories of kickbox full contact and Thai box, I said."
"I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in San Show."
"The rivals who finished the first four in the last world championship in every category were invited."
"In Toronto in 2009, I won bronze."
"In 2005, I finished eight in Vietnam."
"In 2007 in China I finished my fifth morning tournament, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished my third, added."
"It's interesting that I've made some progress in every competition."
"I'll be at this rate for the first year or so!"
"san show" or "sand" is a discipline coming from China, where there are fists and legs, as well as walking on the ground, allowed.
The tapes are traditionally played on the platform and more often in the ring.
The most famous boxer of this form of battle is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
No matter how Nacer Earth keeps only one result in his career, he will courageously participate in the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a sympathetic guy."
"It's a little equivalent for Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Earth has won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before he suffered loss in the finals.
"The one who beat me was a real professional, he analyzed."
"There are four competitors in category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winner semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category fight to be crowned with the only champion, King kung fu."
450 million committed without public competition
Hydro-Quebec agreed after an agreement of 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this avenue, more than 100 contracts are the consortium created by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which obtained the most important contract, a contract to manage the whole project totaling $295 million without public competition.
This consortium, named Energie gérance, was co-appointed in 2004 in conjunction with the selection of Hydro-Quebec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for managing this significant hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energie gérance consortium won a lucrative contract without any declaration of public competition.
For the Quebec side, the complaint against a consortium of companies presents us with a serious ethical problem that risks exclusion of competition and leads to price increases.
"It's a new way to make the rounds and eliminate competition."
"This means that people no longer do the parties' agreements secretly, they are already doing them openly today," said PQ Sylvain Simard yesterday at a press conference.
About something earlier, in the morning, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly, because he says it's difficult to bear, how public interest can be sold like this.
Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, refused this afternoon to deny that this contract would be a coliseum.
"I have my own way," she whispered and claimed that the PQ was "unfortunate" and "lost accuracy."
She said "that would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is a common practice all over the world.
It is usually an alliance limited in time that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise so that they can respond to the call for tenders for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the scope of the work.
The construction is already underway and must be disbursed by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without competition; it was a trade.
It must also be acknowledged that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, nor in relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir discovered last week, the consortium's engineering consulting formula is the subject of government investigation.
If we fly through Quebec companies' business registers at speed, we will be able to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be created.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; let's call it CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that's Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau has particularly underlined the fact that "the territory of La Baie James is a typical special dynamic of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, from the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation which led us to deny the fact that the project management contract was concluded after mutual agreement.
"If you go to the public competition and if there are few participants in the tendering competition, your prices may be higher."
"You have two options to choose: that is to pick out the people who represent in the contract as participants in the competition, and that you say, "Let's make a deal with satisfaction and with a good price."
"But the main idea is that the price is not important, but the competence of people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded by the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ on the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir entered into 109 consulting contracts in the field of engineering concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out soil sampling.
SNC-Lavalin signed 22 contracts, of which Genivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a share in the Energy Management.
All contracts have been closed.
A total of $449,783,344, including a contract with Energie gérance for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard pointed out that four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well known by the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau issued the report that the PQ is also linked to companies that "finance it" before stating that one is more than one of its managers.
Barometer responsible consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in the "non-sided" brands and environmental certification, to be guided by this in the choice of products.
The worst part is that even though we are buying in the media space, which requires us and offers us a more socially responsible consumption, this media space is calling for a lack of reliable information, a failure to meet obligations that even qualify as a brake for its commitment, the Barometer provides the responsible consumption, the first article of which came out yesterday.
Although the consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the people of Quebec, who are trying to sell them, still do not believe them too much.
Two thirds of us actually say that they don't believe in the promises of a firm with regard to the environment, just because the green advertising of companies, they find a measuring instrument that was developed by the University's observatory for responsible consumption in Sherbrooke.
Other information: Half of consumers doubt the authenticity of the official certificates attached to the so-called just products, but also the reliability of the products and labels that are labelled as ecologically responsible, says Barometer.
In the same way, the policy debate on this issue is adopted as a serious only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
However, information on responsible consumption appears to be the first to stimulate this page of consumption that is currently revived by almost one third of Quebecan consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable nature of the information would dampen the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Barometer at the higher price of these products.
Finally, a third of the population of Quebec is looking for reliable data about the products or "green" services we are looking for so that we can get through them with our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and in particular to change the brand of one or more products to respond to their beliefs.
A total of 61% of them preferred purchases by traders from their neighborhood and gave priority to the purchase of food grown in their region, Barometer says.
More "green" and responsible - responsible consumption index reached 64 out of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québec is pleased to present itself as a recycling king who strives for the least impact on the environment by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and ecological consciousness obviously remained somewhere outside their vehicle, says Barometer: in 2010, almost 28% of Quebecans reported that they are using bulk transport or recommending the use of at least two persons to drive in order to protect nature.
The walk and the bike also supported 39.1% of participants in this extensive study of behavior who used this cliché.
State loan to buy back a cinema complex eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which we asked for financial participation in the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris Angus et le Parallèle, agrees with the participation, but only to the amount of the loan.
The development company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a seven million-dollar gift from the Minister of Culture for the purchase of a cinematographic complex on Saint-Laurent's bullvary and which proved its mission as a movie artist, did not get what it required.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected gift, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan, which would otherwise have been lower, some initial expectation that could provide a basis for viable solutions under favourable conditions and with resources from the state.
The first action plan and demand for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised for reduction.
The proposal and action plan were sent to the Minister of the Sodec, President of the Community for the Development of Enterprise in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until 31 December to answer.
However, it appears that the State's gift hypothesis must be really rejected.
Note that the Association of Film Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec has been opposed to the state's direct investment in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, considering that the Minister of Culture is not supposed to finance a real estate project if he does not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, a number of participants in the discussion demanded basic economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the space of his cinemas over ten years of film art after financing himself a complex building, which could have been the reason for a change from the state's financial board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris managed to get a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his head, is campaigning for the release of funds into the private sector, believing that he will save $700,000 for the suppression of acquisition.
Since spring 2009, one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27th next year and to see the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remember Le Devoir, so he ignores, he thinks with his group about the proposals for reductions that were made to him.
Raised in Canada as a whole...
The new American diplomatic origins, known through WikiLeaks, reveal what the United States considers to be a complex minority of Canadians to Americans, but with the same impact, they reflect their feeling of superiority recently appointed to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore amazed that every Canadian voter is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when he goes to vote, and believes that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government to accept her budget in 2009.
Four new reports, including the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday exposed to public opinion, provide additional sensitive details to get each other "under the skin".
The communication with the date of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details the point where the United States is not part of the stakes discussed by the political leaders.
To the great courage of the American embassy in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins has given this situation a few explanations.
"The Canadian minority complex, almost indiscriminate, may remind the political leaders to talk about internal bets instead of realizing that these elections concern the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
"The United States is therefore," he said, "a verbal elephant in these elections: everyone is present, but potentially too dangerous, to talk about them."
The Ambassador understands this 'responsive silence' less the fact that both countries maintain intensive political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, party or even better leader of the party to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that the voters have in mind when they go to the elections."
Another statement of this feeling of importance can be read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help ensure that the government retains its confidence in the vote at the beginning of February, with regard to the federal budget, which Canada publicly recognises its first deficit in more than ten years, due to a recovery plan of between $30 billion and $40 billion," says M. Breese.
There is no mention of the government's having to postpone Parliament's pre-trial session so as not to be defeated by the coalition and that opposition parties remind their survival of the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report signed by Ambassador Wilkins points to Washington's further negative picture , which is broadcast to the United States by dramatic series broadcast to CBC .
The Ambassador is concerned about sending Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe not too logical references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for the purposes of violent questioning by the CIA.
Another report says that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accept some prisoners from Guantanama.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but based on the principle of "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, it says here, "a paper concerning Omara Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, was handed over to the State Secretary."
"The Secrets have accepted the fact that he's auditing the file."
Let's finally note that the people who are concerned with WikiLeaks are thirsty.
Tom Flanagan, former very close advisor to Stephen Harper, said on the waves of CBC that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "destroyed".
It broke up and heard about it and Mike Huckabee in the United States.
World Plan for the Restoration of Light
Yesterday, in Cancún, the United Nations proposed a plan to restore domestic lighting, trade lighting and industrial space in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse effect limitation (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the next limit to be achieved in order to stabilise the climate of the planet from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to launch in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult commitments to reduce on the part of industrialized countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if flammable lamps, which monopolize 50 to 70% of the market, replace fluo compact lamps or, better still, electroluminescent diodes (DEL or LED), the basic amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) GES emissions on the planet would be discarded.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's equivalent to 70% of the emissions from the car park all over the planet.
In Kodani last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary plans to reduce GES global emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will have to be deducted from this balance sheet another 5 Gt in order to achieve the stabilisation of climate warming by 2020 at 2 degrees Celsius so that it can be excluded that it will not be out of control.
In flammable lamps 95% of the energy is dispersed in the form of heat and residues, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluo compact lamps, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new LED lamps, we reduce this consumption twice again.
Fluo compact lamps shall last from 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
New LED lamps, such as those introduced this week by Philips - this company reportedly participated in the UN study - have the estimated lifetime of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than the light bulb, which gives us the idea of a possible savings with a compensation plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new lamps can also work with the restoratives and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed exemptions from fluo compact lamps because they contain mercury and it is necessary to classify it as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless the producers set up collections.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluo compact lamp, but rather a warm coal plant that emits a lot of mercury needed for the production of electricity in molten lamps.
In the United States alone, these centres provide 25 000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report shall also specify in detail the benefits of this international programme for each country.
For example, Indonesia would save billions of dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is an equivalent of 3.5 heat plants with a construction of 2.5 billion
The coast of elephants eagerly awaits the results of the election results.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in the Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and immediately announce the preliminary results, stressing the President of the United Nations."
"He asks all the parties on the Coast of Slovenia and the institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the notice of provisional results."
Despite the pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission allowed the most appropriate date - the middle of the night - to be reached three days after Sunday's cut.
About forty minutes before the deadline was set, the President of the CEI confirmed that the Commission "continued to work" so that it could declare the results.
In the middle of the world , the challenges have increased to finally declare the name of the second round winner, between the retreating Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition member Alassan Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for the "underwater" vote in the north, which the former New Army (UN) rebels have fixed since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in the Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the manoeuvres of intimidation of the volunteers who practised the UN (New Army) in the north of the country had defeated the supporters of the Côte d'Ivoire from going to vote.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaint made by Gbagbo.
However, President Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N'Dré, the very close political union of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who damages any connection with the former rebels, condemned the detention in the announcement of the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has suffered loss and that submitting a complaint to the Constitutional Council after he has defended the electoral commission from sending the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, held on Sunday, was considered to be the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two and a half half years.
The United Nations has pointed out in the middle of a political group on the Côte d'Ivoire that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished his first round on 31 October as a winner with 38% votes against 32% for Alassan Ouattaru, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (ILO), remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by the provisional data with seasonal deviation corrections (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has risen to 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% of the overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 point.
In a broader survey, 3.4 million people in the metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but they would like to work, regardless of whether they are available or not within two weeks to be able to work, and regardless of whether they are looking or not.
The current situation of young people on the labour market has yet to emerge with a new increase in unemployment of 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% in overseas areas.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the International Labour Office.
As far as seniors are concerned, they have recorded in the metropolitan France a slight increase in unemployment to 6.4% in the metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as one year) of 482,000 people over 50 years of age and 6.6% in the overseas areas.
Only the 25-49-year-old population benefited from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point in three months, +0.1 point in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after the debate on its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the Statistical Agency of the European Union, instead continues to produce monthly statistics and announced on Tuesday 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and imprisoned
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the heads of waste management companies and the PS brother of the Bouches-du-Rhône Board of Directors, was accused and imprisoned in the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation into public procurement, thought subdelegated.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of misuse of company property, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, payment of fees, receipt of charges for the purpose of affecting the Office and holding the shooting, his lawyer shall state.
"Alexandre Guérini is a fighter and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions that this man intends to ask him, not some overcrowding."
"It's easy to track her for a lot of criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove it," said his lawyer, Florence Rault, to the AFP, in front of his client's interview.
Mr Guérini said through his lawyers that he sent a brief statement to the judge before his questioning to explain everything.
One of his close friends, Philippe Rapezi, was also accused and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simona, his client never did anything but to ensure the operation of the equipment he was supposed to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew anything like that, Mr. Simon said.
In this regard, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne Aglomeration Services, was charged on Wednesday with the abuse of public funds and plots, and was released, under judicial supervision, with the prohibition of meeting, protagonists of the whole case.
"My client was able to give an explanation of all the facts that have touched him."
"The investigating judge looks at it and lets it go," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
The following four persons were accused and released at night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them being under judicial supervision, the representative of state-run Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is charged for receiving payments for the purpose of affecting the Office and for passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier agglomeration are accused of "depriving and abusing the property of the company", the second of "complaint against the abuse of public funds".
Finally, business partner Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "injuring the use of the company's property".
Among the persons who were confronted with Mr. Guérin is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently accused in a similar case of fraudulent public procurement regarding Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company was helping to make money out of extensive gangsta.
The investigation shall be conducted in the framework of several open-ended X-ray investigations in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in closing public contracts, in particular in the case of waste.
From the source of the close investigation, the investigation shall focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and functioning of the plant in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities of the city of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: The Elysian Palace overrun the Syrian mediators
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotildy Reiss, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "spionage", united his views in France, introduced diplomacy into the war's preparedness and stressed the relationship between Paris and Tehran.
All this was carefully monitored by diplomats from the United States.
The American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the advantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, which went so far as to give them advice on how to manage such cases by hand in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how the leading French representatives tried to convince Washington that the release of young French was not compensation for the release of Majid Kakavanda, Iran imprisoned in France and sought American justice for underground trade in material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they faked a sharp light in the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to credit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilda Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything about it.
Diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the title: "Iran:Francous comments on how to resolve the case of hostages".
Councillor of the Elyssey Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the American diplomat Allegrone.
They explain his French method.
They recommend that Americans do as much as they can to bring their own nationals back to power by violence detained in Iran.
"Do noise," they say, "always say "in the media the words "the fundamental rights of man", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to bring Iran's hostile regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more they'll ask you to stop it."
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, "no silence will solve anything", Iranians are "masters of avoiding maneuvers".
Mr. Richier reminds us that arresting foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political expulsion".
It announces that the freedom of Clotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, on the day when the French Embassy provides it with a safe haven) "is demanding the payment of a high amount of money to the Iranians" (see EUR 230,000).
And they'll announce that the Elysian Palace anticipates cases of hostages, a phenomenon that will "fight out."
Iranians would "be able to arrest about 1800 other French people living in Iran in the future," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilda Reiss has left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, which the United States declares has been released for illegal trafficking in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy as well as many observers are asking for this disturbing match.
For Washington, which is pursuing an illegal Iranian network to obtain nuclear programme material, the release of Majid Khakavanda is a bad report.
Did France enter into the contract?
Freedom of the Iranians for the liberation of the young French?
In another conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier assures us that it is not.
The Elysian palace, as it says, was not only "sudden by this judge's decision", but sought an opportunity to deal with it.
"Talks have taken place between the President's Office and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the decision of the court," he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Council of the Elyssey Palace draws the phone number, hangs the phone bell and then informs the American diplomat that Iran is currently in the Parisian buildings managed by the Iranian embassy."
At the time of Klotildy Reiss' imprisonment in Iran, the Elysian Palace of Efforts, negotiates through communication and organised "runs" to the media to convince that Syrian President Bakar Al-Assad plays "significant" and "impressive" role "mediator".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and note that the manipulation takes its fruit because several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "brest" of French officials".
On which such a measure of "thank you" is based, expressed to Mr. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"And despite their statement of praise, French officials in private acknowledge that they only have a valid idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons which led the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "directs the validation of President Sarkozy's opening policy with Syria", he analyzes.
The policy implemented in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "how to overcome the Syrian role", Paris is trying to "demonstrate Syria, which praisers can serve when playing a constructive role in the area".
The goal is also to "satisfy the grain of trouble between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
August 11, François Richier confided in him: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything, whatever"
"But we thank them anyway."
"That should at least cause confusion and uncertainty among the Iranians."
Clotilda Reiss will return to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts it at the Elysian Palace.
In the communication he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the benefit of freedom of our country".
End of online game after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecival," which will ban adolescents from playing online games after midnight, blocking access to them, the responsible government officials have introduced.
The draft law will be submitted to Parliament in December so that it can ask companies running online games to block access to these games after midnight for persons under 16 years of age, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems with school education and are unable to live a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, a leading factor in the ministry, who has a proposal for a law on care.
Online games will be available from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, clarify.
The government also assumes that it asks companies to limit daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request them to do so by supplementing the responsible employee.
It also provides free programs to people who ask for it, allowing them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "damaged" countries, and the daily press regularly brings different facts associated with the intensive use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is an undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November South Korea won four gold medals at World Cyber Games, and it faces 58 other nations.
The World Championship in 2018-2022: Fifa is setting up a host country.
Full of concern about corruption, Fifa's executive committee is setting up on Thursday of the Host Country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a selection that is politically motivated, where the fight against influence and lobbying risks predominate technical criteria.
The thing is certain, the Royal Fifa competition in 2018 will take place in Europe , the traditional garden of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 Championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to be able to acquire a new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the 2010 African continent premiere, or continue to enter the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities involved in the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides an opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political bets around the world.
Negotiations in the background face the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the evaluation report Fifa documentation English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as documentation from their competitors.
But these reasons will not be too important for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time appointed for the vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelation, leading to the suspension of two members of the EC/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may thus have destroyed the chance of his country, the cobbler buried, who so far hosted the world championship only once in a year.
On Monday, the BBC seized the crown when it sent a document that "screwed on a sponge" by three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa unhappy and bring to discontent the English leader with David Cameron in the first row.
The president hopes that he will be able to repeat the momentum that his predecessor has achieved in the role of Tony Blair, which he managed to win for London's 2012 Olympics organisation in 2005.
Will this intensive activity suffice to add England a new spark to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
There is nothing less certain, because the two Spanish-Portugals lack the trophies of ready stadiums, their well-being (the 1982 World Championship in Spain, the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitious cold showers.
Any legal measures against the English and doubts about the payment capacity of Spain and Portugal only raise the position of Russia, which was outsider even through gaps in its documentation (stages, hotels, transport).
But the president of the government, Vladimir Putin, decided that the championship would not move to Zurich and publicly declared 'a lack of competition in the preparation of the vote', in verbal arguments only barely supported by the English press charges against the members of the EC (European Commission).
"We'll throw them in the mud, try to compromise them," Mr Putin said.
For 2022 they seem to be a logical favourite of the United States with their significant experiences from 1994.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the headquarters of the main sponsors of Fifa, seems to have a great leap ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have prepared a beautiful project.
But these candidatures seem to be premature for both countries, which together in 2002 have undergone the "test".
Another threat: the 2026 World Championships in China, which desperately desires Fifa, made the Asian opportunity for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar, who pulled out of the glove of the great esso in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue in her expansion into new landscapes, but these two countries represent more risks than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pay for flat-rate TV charges (for time travel) paid by European countries, forming a mobile force for Fifa.
Second mandate: visibility (safety)
De Gaulle really screwed up.
Mitterrand raised the idea that he weighs.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
The mandate of the Elysian Palace calls for someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be the candidate in 2012.
Obviously, however, the role of the President is not well in line with the role of secrecy.
It is therefore necessary to act as if the doubts persist.
In one sense or another.
In 2006, and would like to believe it, friends of Jacques Chirac made demands not to be excluded from the third mandate.
On November 15, with a serious expression by Nicolas Sarkozy, he assured that "sometimes it will be decided in the fall of 2011".
As he reminds the members of the UMP Parliament on Wednesday evening in the Elyssey Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has taken on little heat.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far away.
The President only recalled that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year functional periods to two.
It was just his findings, not his announcement.
It's not the first time she remembers the humorous tone of the presidential election at such meetings.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you've got another seven and a half years ahead of you with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: "Don't think I don't consider another step."
His earlier sentences shall not make him a candidate more than the previous day; they shall not make him a candidate or less.
If they make comments, it's because of double truth.
Speeding up your way to the PS candidate, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to Ségolén Royala's cobbler who pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to arrange for the fighting compositions more early than planned.
Bad research on the other side.
First, voters would prefer Françoise Fillon's candidacy against Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy (46%) against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we don't discuss the matter with the UMP," responded immediately and watched people from the immediate vicinity of the government president.
"If they believe a possible defeat, they won't run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppe, obviously balanced.
Euro: The European Central Bank is obliged to continue its procurement of state securities.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central Bank this year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for removing the crisis or, at least, a notice of the stopping of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations which have to be completed by the end of this year.
The European demand crisis is promising, and the institution for issuing securities will no doubt not be able to allow itself to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation today in European securities markets.
In that case, the political price would be higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde gave up the holding of an active role played by the European Central Bank in addressing the crisis of demand from European states.
She didn't want to say if she thought the bank could do more, for example by increasing their programme to buy over-the-counter bonds.
"I would like to express my concern for my European partners (...)".
The President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more specific in Brussels at the hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, and he was satisfied that he stated that the programme for the purchase of State securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see how we will decide" during the meeting this Thursday.
The only certainty: the European Central Bank will monitor its basic constant interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of bonds from the treasury carried out by the Central European Bank doubled by nearly EUR 1.35 billion in the last week.
And because of the lack of understanding on the market, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt that there is any doubt between the parties to the market in anticipation of the continuation of the purchases (see page 29).
Nor do economics expect any significant change in the course.
If the operation of loans for more than three months has already disappeared from the Central European Bank's arsenal, the latter shall access the unlimited provision of liquid assets under large-scale conditions and for a period of from one week to three months.
Today, economics are expected to extend this mechanism for several months.
"I can't imagine that she would change her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean taking the risk of creating a short-term new tension," says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"The progressive horizon announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To the plan of its public debt market intervention, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds in order to revive the mud market," Norbert Bräms adds.
In view of the exposure of European banks to euro area debt on markets, there is nothing more to choose than to maintain their presence on the market.
"It is necessary to compensate for the market failure of investors at any price and to act in such a way as to prevent the recovery of the State's paid performance among the most fragile," the significant bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates have flown, countries will be more concerned about reducing their debt rather than stabilising it.
It's the euro saved at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is behind the back
After the beginning of the week for Italy, the worrying situation was a little relaxed, yesterday with a return rate of 10 years.
Back to temporary rest.
At the end of the meeting with the Prime Minister of the Regions' economy, they said they heard Giulia Tremonti describe the situation as "insolvent" and that she was expecting an "unpredictable" weekend, which then demented the participants.
In any case, in Tuesday, a deviation from long German interest reached the 210 basic points record and the price of anti-fraud contracts (CDS) dropped to 263 points, causing certain disturbances in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the deviation from German interest was more than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said of himself that he was "too busy" "with the stormy development of the markets" and possibly a plague of origin from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the absence of growth and insignificant fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and exposes it to the risk that it will not be able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, calculated by the European Commission, the public finances deficit will still represent 4.3% of the gross domestic product next year (as against 3.9% of the government forecast) and 3.5% in 2012 (although 2.7%).
From this point on, we will be briefing on a new set of supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, up to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new stringent measures will have to be adopted," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The basic stones of its economies are fine and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating them for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Governing Council of the International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, no short-term or long-term, because over its significant debt (119.2% of the gross domestic product 2011, NDLR), the effort to stabilise required in Italy is less than the effort required from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD's leading economist.
There is still a question of political instability.
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi will face a proposal to express the distrust of the Messenger's camera and then they could start organizing the elections that will be held at the end of March.
This would be the start of a period, which is not appropriate for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde again stressed this yesterday during the press conference in Paris: "I think that Europeans have demonstrated this throughout the day and night, are obviously very solidarityful decisions, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
While everything is relative, yesterday's expansion, regarding interest on European State bonds, has brought water to governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could degrade the record of Portugal's debt, a goal that is most focused on various speculations.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and clear policy, particularly on banking systems," said economic Exane BNP Paribas.
More about "political time is running slower than market time".
The knowledge of this disrupted relationship and the hidden danger intensifys the European countries' debate aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultation between finance ministers, the most affected problem, and more broadly with their G20 counterparts, is very well developed.
In view of the Eurogroup meetings (Eurogroup) and the Ecofin group from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is taking place today.
The programme contains non-conventional measures to support euro area countries with a market focus (see above).
As regards the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, appointed a trip to Singapore to Asia on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If it is not the aim of this trip to raise funds, it prepares a land-use administrator to achieve this objective.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, the U.S. official representative told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilised funds by additional direct engagement in the IMF.
The countries concerned in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that attach themselves to a tight measure of rapid impact.
Lisbon and Madrid are different from Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international aid at any price before applying their own budgetary corrections and before deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain their continued confidence.
The capital participants in the European Funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the process of normalising markets with overcompensated bonds.
On his way to Paris on November 24th, Axel Weber came up with the idea that the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be enough for the Union to recapture the stock of securities.
Economies from Barclays Capital, which is an actor of the very first business plan with European over-the-counter claims, consider that the EUR 100 billion addendum would be enough, "better" in the form of direct financial liquidity.
The medium exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, up to this day EUR 60 billion.
The Council, which has every chance to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions worsened.
Snow and heredity: 24 countries have an orange emergency.
Snow supplies are still causing transport difficulties, especially on the roads of other classes in Britain, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four periods since now have an orange emergency due to the risk of snow and herring.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, Les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne have joined 20 times that already have a declared orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Meteo France, significant snowfalls affect problems in the north of La Gironde and Les Charentes and snows poorly on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the periods concerned and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snow landings are large enough to cause transport problems and disrupt some economic activities, Metéo France says.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some periods prohibited the passage of heavy goods transport - over 7.5 tonnes of trucks with the Guingamp-Lannion route and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on the second-class roads in Britain is very difficult, and police recommend that they drive only if it is really necessary and that the operation of some trucks was cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned in Picardia on Thursday.
On Wednesday evening, no specific measures are envisaged to limit freight transport.
The district office "calls all drivers of cars for the greatest care on the roads and to adapt the vehicle's character".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris Roissy airport and 10% at Orly due to expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that a passenger using air transport services connect with his company.
In the United Kingdom, Gatwick Airport is closed until Thursday morning to South London and Edinburgh Airport to Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on the modernization of transport to Ile-de-France in the full stream, it has been raining billions.
At least during the discussion.
We recall in particular 23 billion on the Grand Paris metro, which is to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order to enable this building to be released, he announced the granting of a grant of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use for the contracts part of its double source of financing.
We're finally getting to the first additions today.
The 2010 Financial Correction Act, which examines the National Assembly Financial Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms laid down to ensure these funds.
There are two: creating a special tax from equipment and raising tax from the office at Ile-de-France.
First, let's read in the text of the draft law, Article 15, "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated as follows: "The income from this interest is 117 million euros a year".
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for the office that already exists, which is why, "to be modernised to increase the profit obtained from it and to reach this increase by Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it cost?
Overcrowded.
That's not spelled out in the text.
We've got four billion away.
"It is stated that these fiscal resources are connected to EUR 4 billion of the capital grant, which will be mobilised by the state and invested in Société du Grand Paris under the project," we can read in explaining the reasons.
In the company of SGP, this system doesn't seem shocking.
"From the moment we created revenue (both taxes, etc.), we can cover the study for three years and then dig up to 4 billion, it explains."
"It will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
The SGP considers that 4 billion will be allocated to the 2014 budget by 2013.
This mechanism, in which 4 billion promised are still unknown subscribers, risks triggering some rough parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Guilty Hackers and Reasonable Investigators
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, there is an obvious scandal, a scandal that appears to be a scandal facing only the face of the prejudices that govern relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it talks about profound changes at international level and precedes the future of controlled regression.
But let's do the right thing.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm the fact that every document drawn up by a secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of printed paper.
"The extraordinary discovery" of the American way of sexual life Berlusconho is announced by what has been read in any newspaper for months (all but these two Berlusconi own), and the scarcity of the character profile of Kadáfi has long been the object of the cabaret artist for sketches.
The rule that secret documents may consist only of news already known is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to the bookstores dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that every work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Zednars) exactly what has already been written in the previous parts.
And this is not only because the author of the occult texts does not like to look for new information (or not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who are committed to occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
The same applies to classified documents.
The informant is a linear, and the linear (or limited spirit) chief of secret services (and if he is not, he could, as I know, be the editor of the Liberian newspaper) who only considers what he admits to be true.
The information with a high secret about Berluscon, which the American embassy sent to the state resort, was also published by Newsweek a week earlier.
Why, then, was there so much practice around the discovery of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of states can call or fly on a joint dinner plane, lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in the representation, turned into a spy center.
Any viewer who's watching the film on the investigation knows very well that it's apparently ignored only by the lymerism.
However, the fact that this is being repeated in public, that it is a shameful obligation to be cautious and that it sheds the wrong light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most intimately hidden information from the world's most powerful country is a hard blow, not unrelenting, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both victims and their "workers".
But let's move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
At one time, in the days of Orwell, it was possible to perceive all power, like some Big Brother, who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been proven since the time that, thanks to the possibility of controlling every movement by telephone, every transaction made, a visited hotel, a used highway and so on, became a complete victim of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now that even the "grapes" with the most secret information the powerful can't resist a hacker's intervention, it stops being a one-way control report and becomes a circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least hacker - elected as a citizen's offender - can know all the secrets of power.
How can power be maintained that no longer has the opportunity to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the real secret is an infinite secret (and the infinite secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the nature of Berlusconio or Merkel is really a secret infinite secret, because it is derived from public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that the mystery of Hillary Clinton was an infinite mystery, means to withdraw all power.
WikiLeaks didn't make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wounded power so significant?
It is clear that in the future countries will not be able to send on-line sensitive information - that would be equivalent to its publication on a poster marked on the street.
But it is also quite clear that with current technologies, there is little hope that you can keep the message hidden by phone.
There's nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of the state traveled by plane and joined some of its colleagues.
How can they be kept in private and sensitive news in the future?
I know that for this moment my forecast is science fiction and it's fantastic, but I have to imagine the government factors that are conveying discreetly the fulfillment of formality on uncontrollable tracks and carrying only the messages that they know to remember or rather hide rare information in the boot.
Information will be stored in unique copies in key locks: Overall, the attempt to spy on the Watergate affair had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had an opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, which means back.
One century after the wireless telegraph meant a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Video cassettes (analogues) have enabled movie lovers to take a step-by-step film, move it forward and back and reveal all the secrets of the installation, while now CD (digital) allows only to jump on the chapters, which means by macropores.
We will arrive from Rome in three hours by speed, while on the way by plane and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that policy and communication techniques will return to cars with drawn horses.
Last note.
Otherwise the press tried to understand what had been established in the mystery of the embassy.
Now they're ambassadors asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacks its financing promises
The year after the Kodana Agreement is the time to try to meet the commitments to quickly unlocked funding (so-called fast start or early start) implemented by developed countries.
And the great French hacks were discovered
In the Kodan Agreement, the developed countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union promised EUR 7.2 billion for three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
At the beginning of COP16, the EU has drawn up a large essay to convince its partners about the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: a report clarifying the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a large side event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparent operation is invaluable and appreciated at its real value: the developed countries and civil society would like all the developed countries and civil society to act in the same manner as the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, leading it to the right path for compliance with its pledge of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we'll find things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" in accordance with the Codana Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is incurred without public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no match in what it means "new and additional".
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone picks the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered the reference year 2009 to be: international funding has been maintained and it adds 150 million to it for three years the title of fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references to annual payment periods or to public development aid.
On the contrary, France believes that funding "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of public aid for the development of d'Aide public au development.
In particular, France's overall amount of aid to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even be reduced), should comply with its commitment to financing "new and additional"...
Another determining factor is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There's no rule yet, and each one chooses his own way of calculating.
Some, such as France, think that 1€ borrowed is equal to 1€ given.
Obviously it is difficult to prove: the effort is not equal.
If the use of loans can be presented for some investments that are profitable (often related to the reduction of emissions in more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we will receive as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , we should not understand it from the title of our commitments, but as the price of the loan for the credit country (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France can only give the following justification: "it fulfils its commitment of EUR 420 million, making 91.5% of the loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of the gift (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan to this extent.
Germany has asked for 46% from here, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including Slovakia) comply with their commitments with 100% gifts.
In other words, when the total majority of the European Union gives 1€ within the framework of its commitment, France gives only 10 cents and considers this effort to be comparable.
That's a nice piece of cake!
To sum up, when financing "fast start" France operates with two masterpieces: on one side with the development of shares in time and on the other side with a real financial burden.
Although he only spends EUR 36.1 million, he can convince us that he spends EUR 420 million "new and additional" in connection with his promises.
Manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bercy who has made such a decision) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would Member States continue to give when only to borrow) and when negotiating, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The Chapter of Early Financing is just a small, relatively short-term issue in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could also be a grain of sand in a huge machine, such as the UNICEF.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw conclusions from this first year of early financing.
First, France should notify the change in its way of managing the accounts for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of compliance with its obligations and compliance and justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should be discussing long-term financing contributions (other core chapters currently under discussion): we will not miss the question of "additionality" or the way in which loans are charged.
France should change its position in order to become as progressive with these deposits as with others.
It is hoped that everyone will join the new Ministry of the Environment, Mrs Koscisko-Morizet, who will come to Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could lead to an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to enable further discussions to take place.
An alarm on pesticides that children will see.
Ten years later, one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published on this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Moving for the Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The association, which notes that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the processed problem", bought between July and September food commonly consumed in four foods and one light food as a light meal for one child nearly decades in supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plates is confusing: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 are listed among the substances carcinogenic, possibly or likely, and five are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could affect the internal mixing (PE) glands, according to the studies of several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Even though in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical adopted individually are not exceeded, in our research we see well that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants, perhaps carcinogenic, and/or PE is infectious," the association states.
For breakfast butter and tea with milk, they contain about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as well as in about twenty residues that could interfere with the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, mentioned in the study as a small hamster, contains the traces of six chemicals, including the forbidden fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, which are included in lunch, where studies have shown the levels of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, dairy beef, tuna in the can and even gum and gum were sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals.
The presence of nitrogen and chloroform were detected in water from the mouth of the analysis.
Steak from salmon to dinner was "the richest" with 34 found chemical residues and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not avoided.
The final risk to consumers of this 'contaminant cocktail' is likely to be underestimated’, according to the study.
Ecological Europe-Greens (EE-LV) has proposed that a moratorium on the use of pesticides should be set up to stop "the rise of civilisation diseases".
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the state of presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
