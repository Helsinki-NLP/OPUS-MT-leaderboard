Tom won't win.
Tom thinks you're stupid.
Stop yelling.
He doesn't keep anything going.
Do you have a bigger stick?
I thought this book was attractive.
I don't know the answer.
I love living.
I don't want to go with you.
I'll be back in three weeks.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
What does "Tatoeba" mean?
Is Tom okay?
I guess I lost my key.
Who sent you?
That woman is under arrest.
Are you all right?
Pakistan is a Muslim country.
Can you understand the French language?
I'll be back.
Tom says he'll quit.
Khan!
Tom's gone.
Kids like to do this.
It's too bad for him.
Did you ever do that?
Is it worth it?
What date is it today?
Goodbye.
He was angry.
I agree.
My dad likes pizza.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I wrote a letter.
I like Apple.
Didn't you buy it yesterday?
Eat the straw!
It's not true what you said.
They have two daughters.
Is there anything left for children?
Come here!
Everyone ignored Tom.
I live in a small village.
Watch Tom.
What's the price?
Don't look!
We agree.
Tom's gone outside.
How are you?
Tom's playing the guitar really good.
I don't want you.
Do you have my book?
I'll be back later.
Tom Mary ruled.
Don't open it.
Come on in.
Tom's teaching me French.
Would you mind if I sat next to you?
Then there's trouble.
My neighbor's name is Tom Jackson.
I don't know what to say.
Yesterday was my best birthday.
Tom, where are you going?
I need a pen.
You have to eat this cheese.
Who can you take a vacation one day?
I want to change my ticket.
Tom's clearly not happy.
Eat whatever you like.
They all yelled.
It's too late.
Let's go.
I didn't get the test.
I had a bee.
Don't wait.
How long has it been open?
It's us.
Why don't you try and get your money back?
Can I see your passport?
I can't find a word.
How can you be so calm?
Eat whatever I want for you.
Rome in Italy.
Tom's tired.
I can handle it.
When will you come back?
Can you speak French?
I'll never let you do this alone.
That's what Mount Everest is like.
I sat down.
Come back.
Tom tried to keep his face up.
Tom's dead.
Tom was crying like a kid.
Let her go.
I can't tell you another one from a warehouse.
I'm reading your book.
Don't say anything.
He was talking.
Can I eat?
Tom Mary's long.
The kid's shaking.
I need sleep.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, seven, seven; these were the children of Heth, nine and twenty.
He's reading the book in the evening.
I've won.
Take the armchair.
I won't do it.
Good night!
They're all shaking.
There are many branches of science.
No, I'm not, you!
See the bikers and travelers!
You always complain.
For what?
I want to open an account.
You'll have to cut your ticket when you're on the bus.
It's not hard to learn French.
I'm cold.
I bought a pound of meat the other day.
Talk face-to-face!
Everything okay?
Linkon died in 1865.
We've failed.
How many of my room number?
He hasn't arrived yet.
Find Tom.
I don't want to go with you.
Hurry up, Tom.
It's church hour.
Let me go.
I accepted her invitation.
They have two twins.
Do you have a car?
You're very brave.
Don't hurt me.
Do you have a bike?
The most important thing you can do now is to stay calm.
Where's the shit store?
Look at Tom.
How many nights are you gonna be?
I'm going to school.
My neck's a little dry.
I have a new red car.
I'm Dakis.
Watch Tom.
"Why aren't you going?" "Because I don't want to go."
You're not the first man to tell me this.
He's eating.
Tom's a good swimmer.
Doesn't it work?
He doesn't want to talk about it.
I've learned a lot from you.
Cover me.
Do you have a car?
Are you eating meat?
Is there any other way to get there?
No one likes this here.
You're not paying attention.
Can you show Tom around?
Take it.
Please accept my sincere apology.
Do you have something to tell me?
I can't understand what you're saying.
Don't eat anything but fruit.
I accepted his invitation.
Is Tom okay?
You're a doctor.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
What are you doing?
There is not enough language.
Don't move!
They screamed.
My dad's always mad.
Tom wants to catch an empty fish.
He's close.
I like him.
It was important.
Tom closed his eyes.
Where's your stuff?
Tom chipped the battalion.
How many people do you have at your party?
You should sleep.
I want Tom here.
It'll be ten years in April.
Tom's still alive.
He knows where we are.
What are you doing?
He's a doctor.
You can eat whatever you want.
I've been working as a wetter for three years.
Tom was there.
You run.
Kiss Tom.
We can't sleep for words.
He can speak French.
I got your letter.
I agree.
Got it.
Tom's not happy about it.
I like him.
You're great.
I don't want to go to sleep.
I like my mother's music.
Is this the way to go to the station?
Do you have a bike?
You always complain.
Are you eating meat?
My limbs are hurting.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
Can you play the piano?
Look at Tom.
Today I got a call from Tom.
Listen to me.
I want to buy the Anars.
What is your name?
Don't yell!
The river has gone to the Pacific Ocean.
Why are you yelling?
I love to write songs in French.
Tom needs a friend.
Nice to see you again.
How do you expect me to do this alone?
I saw him run.
I don't want to eat now.
Make yourself comfortable.
I know Tom was your friend.
Stop browsing.
How many guillotines have you seen behind one?
How am I gonna get to the airport?
I need a doctor!
Tom's shaking.
Tom, I'm a little busy here.
He's running now.
I just found her home.
I told you.
That's mine.
We'll win.
You can eat whatever you want.
I'm not looking for my material.
When did the Boston train leave?
How deep is it?
I ran outside.
I don't care what he doesn't do.
Here's your bag.
I didn't forget.
We wrote our own songs.
Are you okay?
I'll try hard not to bother you in your study.
Trust me.
I'm sorry to be late.
He can say anything he wants.
Were you there?
I know your name.
What's the ticket for the music organization?
Tom was talking.
I'm your friend, then?
How long does it take to get out of here by taxi and train station?
Tom will yell.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I'll take you back in twenty minutes.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
I accepted his invitation.
What does that mean?
I saw Tom last night.
You don't understand.
They're all shaking.
Would you like to talk more slowly?
What teeth are you doing?
The woman eats the straw.
Tom wanted you to take it.
I'm done.
My father can fly the plane.
Who doesn't want to win?
He eats fruit.
Attack!
Tom yelled.
Tom said Mary allowed him to leave quickly.
What's this book about Tom?
How long are you!
It's over.
Don't leave me alone.
Where can I buy stamps from?
I heard a scream.
Will you come down?
I'm useless.
Tom lied about his age to get into the club.
You can stay as long as you want.
He's sleeping like kids.
I didn't aim.
Do you eat meat?
I want to cut my beard.
Don't stop here.
Forgive me, but it's not possible.
I want your opinion.
Who your friend needs to remember.
This object is easily expanded.
Can you please say what you said and say it once?
I totally agree.
You go first.
Take us to the hospital.
I'm not your friend.
He ran.
I lost your phone number.
Get out of here!
Are you going to fish with us?
How old was he?
Tom's reading me French.
I thought it was nice to see it.
More water days.
I love to go around.
I shouldn't be logged out.
Why?
Tom's breathing very strongly.
I know we still love each other.
Forgive me. I've been waiting for you.
What did you get?
Sit here.
It's too big in the hospital.
He's asking how it's possible.
I told them to send another ticket.
I can't believe it!
Tom will talk.
He explained the literal meaning of the phrase.
It's your fault.
Read it first.
How old is your father?
I saw my mother's busy taking out some clothes.
How much did you eat?
I'm not your friend.
I'm not yelling.
What does that word mean?
Wait outside.
Can you take me to the Grand Hotel?
I don't deny it.
Puzzle game.
They need a friend.
Why don't you try and get your money back?
Tom scared Mary.
If he were to follow his doctor's advice, he might still be alive.
What is the purpose of your journey?
Tom can read French.
Ask Tom.
Don't yell!
What's the next stop?
Why aren't you coming with us?
My throat hurts when I'm going to sing.
I'm dancing.
We often eat together.
He's a doctor.
Is he American?
I'm too tired.
Tom died three days later.
Tom was asleep on the train.
I'm lost.
He speaks French.
How much bus rent?
The meeting place and tomorrow are both stable.
Call my husband.
The government has shut down Eyak.
Tom is with us.
What is your full name?
Tom was playing guitar.
Rule is rule.
I'm happy to help you.
Do you understand?
I don't know if I have time.
How much money is needed to get inside?
I want our full speech.
I saw them.
He's eating a little too much.
I'm a master man.
Tom's in there.
How can you be so calm?
The capital of Bangkok.
Look down.
How old is the universe?
Someone's here.
Here we go.
He's trying.
You might be wondering how I got to know that thing.
Don't stop.
Everyone saw it.
We're here too.
My name is Emily.
Where can I buy a book from?
Do you know what he said?
What a shame.
I'm playing right now.
Call the hospital.
I can't get my stuff.
Let me talk.
Open the door.
We're here.
Ask Alex.
My father's going to China.
I didn't eat.
Tom's lying.
Don't take us for granted.
I'll be back before midnight.
Come with me.
Get out of here.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Where's the hospital in the neighborhood?
Where's the knife?
That was a hell of a bitch.
I like black.
I rely on you.
Do you have any yeast?
I'm having an empty time.
They screamed.
He's asking how it's possible.
I forgot to call her today.
I saw him wash his car.
Tom's gone long.
It's smaller than me.
How many years have you been in the woods?
How am I supposed to go to the station?
Tom thought the knife would save him from the dinosaurs.
It's easier for me to write about death than to write about life.
I heard you scream.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Don't leave me alone.
Please eat something.
He hasn't come yet.
My father's home.
Look, there's a bull in the dining room!
I'm a student.
My father's open.
I think you two know Tom.
How many nights will you stay?
I didn't say anything.
You should ask him for advice.
I'm not a doctor.
Everyone yelled.
Who's coming?
They're coming, Tom.
We're back in South America.
What is your favorite TV program?
They have a gun.
I'm in Dickie.
You really don't matter.
What do you want?
He can say whatever he wants.
How long does this stop?
There's no one there.
You need a friend.
My horse's hurting.
Shut up.
Contact Tom.
I want you to talk to Tom.
I respect adults.
Spanish is his mother tongue.
They don't care.
When did the Lord’s Evening Meal begin in Japan?
Tom's never been so happy.
Don't sing.
They need a friend.
I heard you scream.
Don't eat anything but that fruit.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
Be careful!
No one can do this.
I'm full of rice.
What's your hat?
Anything he wants to say.
I only have one blanket.
Don't talk to Tom like that.
He's talking.
What language is spoken in the United States?
I read English.
Let us in.
He was speaking.
He hasn't come yet.
Is that your book?
I'm out.
Tom's grown up in the woods.
I don't have anything to do.
Would you like some more?
It's already seven.
I haven't done it in years.
How much money do you want?
Democracy inspires freedom.
I like my tea.
How much is it?
I can kill you.
Tom's awake.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
I can speak in French.
I don't want you to go.
My father's busy.
It's already seven.
I was in Rome.
Hurry up.
I can put my hands on the ground without my hands.
The police ordered us to follow.
You're a doctor.
Try to stay calm for a while.
I'm so happy for Tom.
How old is he?
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
Can I get some towels?
It's not always easy to do the right thing.
Where's the airport bus?
He can speak French.
It's your key.
I can't.
A car hit Tom.
That's weird!
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
He can speak French.
I'm sick of being alone and nobody's talking like you.
Have you ever gone to Boston?
That's a bad sign.
You can study here.
I'll call them once tomorrow.
Come in two hours.
I know Tom's tired.
I want some money.
Tom's dead.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I'll watch.
Nobody knows me in the woods.
Get in touch with Tom.
It's been snowing all night.
What's that under?
I'm gonna need a cab tonight.
I heard you scream.
I can't see you.
I don't understand what you're saying.
How long are you going to sleep?
You have to do something about it.
I'll buy €100 a day.
It's gone.
Please adjust the volume a bit.
Are you out of your mind?
They're shaking.
Turn left.
I killed Tom.
The library on the left.
What does that word mean?
Mary's shaking.
I teach English.
Eat whatever you like.
There's no doubt.
Kids like cake.
Tom Jackson is your real name?
Tom's dead.
Tell me what you need.
I haven't found my contact lens yet.
I was afraid of Tom's dog.
Tom saw him.
Your bike is like my bike.
Why do you want to leave today?
Sit down.
Drive carefully.
I see TV.
Don't cry.
Tom wanted you to take it.
What did you bring?
He told me he was going to Venice.
Listen to me for a second.
Can you believe it?
He's smaller than me.
I don't speak Japanese.
We're both right.
Tom slept outside.
Sit down.
Don't worry about me.
It's gone.
What happened?
I agree with you.
How much is it?
How can they forget us?
I can understand your situation.
I'm not Tom.
That's funny!
My book is here.
I'm Tom's wife.
I'm not too busy right now.
Where are you going Monday?
They're shaking.
Tom Jackson wrote three books.
Tom told me that today.
I don't want to go to the woods.
Your answer is wrong.
I know.
I'm having a little fun.
I'm not proud of it.
Run it.
The train came just like time, so we didn't have to wait.
I'm not your friend.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Come with me.
Is that your new girlfriend?
You can write in any language. All languages in Tatoeba are the same.
I've let loose. I don't do anything.
He can come.
He's an important person.
The train stops at all stations.
I didn't care.
I haven't got any money yet.
Where's the mistake?
I can't be at the meeting.
He's a doctor.
I'm taking you to the next station.
Are you a doctor?
I'm eating now.
You should ask him for advice.
March 1991 was cut off from Harbat.
My son knows how to watch the clock.
I'm looking for a good hotel.
I'm a woman.
I'll be back in ten hours.
Don't fool yourself.
I don't want to look at Tom.
He's a doctor.
Goodbye.
You look sick.
I want a guitar.
Do I have to save it?
Is that blood?
Call me tomorrow.
Weather, get me some water.
Let's find Tom.
My mother can play a very good piano.
Can you speak French?
We'll eat now.
We win.
I went to Rome.
Please fill in this form?
We've seen it.
I'm glad to see you again.
They don't care.
How old do you want to get married?
It was too late to go to school.
Forgive Tom.
Who knew how to hurt Tom?
No one believes in hell today.
Let him go.
I'm hopeful.
Tom kept screaming.
How are you?
He can speak French.
How old is this church?
I want to go back to Australia before my passport expires.
Sit right there.
You can go there.
I don't want to get involved in all this.
How many nights will you stay?
Is your husband at home?
This can be Japanese.
Tom's running.
We love coffee.
Let's hear what Tom has to say.
Tom loves me.
What did you forget?
I live here.
Tom cried almost every day.
He broke his roll and broke it.
Tom brought it.
I like him.
I'll cook.
Would you please say again?
I'll be back in three hours.
I'm yours.
Take Tom to the hospital.
Take my hand.
How can they forget us?
That's why you don't want to be alone.
Are you going to hang out with me?
How old are you?
Don't go to lunch.
Call me tomorrow.
Sit where you want.
Tom doesn't want to hear it.
We're Arab.
Tom was hurt.
Where are you?
Smile a little.
I lost your phone number.
Everyone's here.
Will you eat something?
I can cut the salt.
There's nothing left in the cold.
Nothing happened.
Everyone's lying.
I'm your friend.
Time has expired.
Try harder.
Have you ever had a cuckoo fish?
He's talking.
I like him.
How long are you!
I did my job.
I want my hat.
I was crying.
I don't like my body.
Wherever he went, his dog followed him.
You're not a doctor?
I saw him run.
Tom a son's name and Mary a girl's name.
Tom's in trouble, isn't he?
What's your name?
Let's get out of here.
How much is that?
Do what he says.
I think the train's late.
It's gone.
I have two lucks.
Hold it.
Nobody's talking.
Tom's talking.
I'm hungry.
What am I eating?
Keep Tom away from me.
What's your father's name?
I want some money.
Eat your milk.
The people of Madrid are surprised.
People can't see too much lust.
Let me tell you.
Tom Daba likes it.
I want you to come with me.
Tom's dead.
Tom was angry.
I don't like our coffee.
Sit here.
Eat the pudding!
I heard you scream.
Call me.
Welcome.
I want to buy some cheese.
Call the doctor!
I'm not worried.
Is this site empty?
We're winning.
My brother is two years older than me.
Stop!
The hotel was built last year.
Eat everything.
I want my guitar.
Stop that woman.
What are you going to do tomorrow?
Don't talk.
You can write in any language. All languages in Tatoeba are the same.
They're there.
It's her home.
Forty million people speak English as their first language.
This house is my fault.
Where can I buy food from?
Let him go.
I forgot his name.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
Tom was with me all day.
How much time do you need to go to the station?
Who ate?
Where can I buy tickets from?
How old is your grandfather?
He can say Japanese.
How many numbers do you want to go to Wikikey?
My feet are hurting.
How many total students?
You can study here.
Tom seems happy and excited to see him.
He's less than me.
Tom Chocolate likes cake very much.
I'll go now.
Have fun.
I was late last night.
Didn't you get cold?
Eat whatever I want for you.
Don't call me.
Is it far from here?
Where's the boy?
What time did New York train leave?
I'm on my way.
I like him.
Do you want to learn French?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I don't understand.
Let's go.
New country.
He's sleeping like kids.
Can you show me your boarding pass?
Can you please help me?
It's smaller than me.
It's never easy to win.
I'll take care of it.
Do you have time?
I thought you'd come.
Tom's in a lot of trouble.
I'm busy.
You can go home now.
He's less than me.
I think Tom's fine.
I'll be back in two days.
Tom told Mary that he was going to kill himself, but he wasn't as brave as he was.
Are you going to fish with us?
Although it's not bad for itself, in many cases, many watch too much television.
You should ask him for advice.
I'll take him.
I'm cold.
I'm sorry.
I'm still your friend.
I still can't believe I believed Tom.
Be careful.
My son can't count yet.
Take a look at the car.
I'll eat.
I don't want to go on my own.
How far is the station from here?
He got sick at the end of last week.
Tom hit the door at the bar, but no one knocked.
He's a doctor.
Stop snooping.
I've got a headache.
Go to the hospital.
The state angel came back.
Please continue.
It's broken.
Tom always takes care of him.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I deny it.
Wait outside.
I want a cab now.
Shut up.
Who is he?
It happened at least three times.
Tom wants me to go with him.
We'll see if we can try!
Tom's tired.
Don't forget us.
Tom kept talking.
I'm south.
You look very tired.
Tom was waiting for me all afternoon.
He's eating.
I was sick at the end of last week.
I'll see you next month.
Tom's father needs us to contact his mother.
Where can I buy that paper from?
I'll be back in seven hours.
Is the neck too deep?
I'm late.
Call Tom.
What's the price?
Tom saw him.
How long is your plane?
Tom's long, but not as long as I am.
She's my wife.
I'm not very good at swimming.
Where's the tour office?
Don't go.
Your shoes are here.
He didn't tell me his name.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Are you here?
What happened?
Home tax with $100.
I'm not very good at French.
My dad's going to China.
Can he speak French?
I want it.
I'm your friend, huh?
Help me!
I'll help you.
I don't agree with him.
Call the police!
I was worried.
There's a cup on the table.
I'll be back in an hour.
I have to get out of this ship.
It's Tom.
He hasn't come yet.
Kim smiles.
I don't live in town.
Women have changed the world.
Let's go. Let's go.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Tom started screaming.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
It'll cost €30.
Start here.
We were waiting for them.
I like yellow.
Tom decided to keep a diary.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I'm not your friend.
How old is he?
He's coming back.
Why are you yelling?
Can I get the check?
Do you have something bigger?
Tom's double coming from me.
That's what I need.
I don't think you need any help.
Tom was waiting outside the gate.
Don't wait.
Is the magic open today?
Don't wait.
Don't worry about me.
Shall we eat outside today?
Keep Tom away from me.
Tom's hurt.
He's gone.
What are my London clothes made?
Where can I buy it from?
I need to send a fax.
He's eating a little too much.
He taught me to write.
Call my family.
I could play that song.
I was surprised.
Where's Boston?
Our Dakis.
The rules are easy.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You're in a better position than me.
He hasn't arrived yet.
I can't shake my right hand.
I'm in the hospital.
Tom caught the thief.
Tom, I want to talk to Mary.
Can you understand what I'm saying?
Tom was surprised to see that Mary married him.
Success depends on effort in most areas.
Tom's in a lot of laughter.
Tom's got his head blown.
Were you born there?
Everyone knows it now.
I got my shoes.
I was surprised.
Do you keep on doing this?
What's the tooth?
The contact is offline.
Can I get a hat?
Have you ever broken your bones?
I want to go to the next stop.
How are you?
I'll go to the dentist tomorrow.
I can't believe it!
So what?
He hasn't arrived yet.
They're doctors.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Did you ever ride a horse?
He was talking.
I have two sisters.
How about you?
I had nothing to say to Tom.
Try harder.
Tom, it's all right.
Why are you sitting there?
What language is spoken in the United States?
I'm tired.
He's got two daughters.
I want you to talk to Tom.
I'm your friend.
Take Tom's back.
Tom always remembers him.
He's an experienced teacher.
I think you both know Tom.
Tom here.
Everyone wants happiness.
I forgot your phone number.

Let him go.
Let's wait here.
How long did the shuttle bus leave for the airport?
Stay home.
Tell me what you want.
I don't know if I'll have time to do this.
Tom's taking care of him.
I want you to call Tom.
Tom bought some blue.
Tom's gone.
You go ahead.
We've had dinner all night.
School's gonna start tomorrow.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not waiting.
I don't think Tom hates you.
What's that under?
A soccer game.
The sky is clear.
Namskar!
I'm really celebrating your gift.
She told me she was going to Venice.
What's your phone number?
He's in his hand.
What does this sign mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Wait here.
Have I been too late?
Let him go.
I can't say right.
Language Hello is a means of communication.
Tom knows that.
I've never heard of Tom before.
How long did the next train leave for Tokyo?
Tom's taking a big risk.
Is that yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Are you going to America next month?
I don't want to go to the bathroom.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He hasn't come yet.
I'm sorry!
You want me to tell you something.
Snow reflects excessive lust.
Come out.
They yelled.
I ran away from home.
We made a pancake for the funeral.
Don't you have a bike?
I don't know if he'll come.
You're shouting.
He's gone.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Everyone saw it.
I'll give my bee some food in the morning and in the morning.
My son came to my house.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your passport?
Please just give me my speech.
Do what he says.
You're so tired.
Tom started screaming.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always takes care of him.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We've seen them.
Today is June 18th and today is the birthday of Muriel.
Who won?
Come on, let's get ready.
We have to tell empty Tom to do this, right?
Can I get these blankets out of here?
I'm going to Osaka Station.
I don't think Tom is responsible for this.
There's someone in the castle.
I went to work.
I've learned to live without him.
My father's very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Let's go. Let's go.
Tom was very busy with the job.
I'm not proud of the way I used it.
I woke up.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm shaking.
My hand watch isn't working properly.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is this Tom's book?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could have died.
Are you sure?
We have to go now.
He's out of school.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He's just got his head warmed.
Wherever he goes, his dog would follow him.
Who is it?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
It's my business to store the old bottles.
I like my score.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
Don't you have a bike?
Do you want to come?
My mom can play very good golf.
He knows where we are.
I know your name.
Tom's not here anymore.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped screaming.
How old is Tom?
Hurry up!
Stop whining.
Was Tom there?
I'm bleeding this afternoon.
My back's still hurting.
Where'd Tom go?
They look like Americans.
You were Tom's only friend.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted her invitation.
My father can drive a very good car.
I'll be alone.
You need a friend.
Forget Tom.
I think Tom said his name was Jackson.
You've known Tom for a long time.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My material has not yet arrived.
Tom hasn't come here yet.
Please wait until he arrives.
Tom doesn't want to talk to him.
Eat something.
Is there anyone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's fine.
Where do I get the stamp?
I'm going to wake up.
Can he speak French?
Tom might want to take that.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
A little more?
I left one day.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Stop that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where do I demand my material?
We do what we want.
Tommy's right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is for students who don't speak Japanese.
Tom wanted to be Minister.
Who will you believe?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I needed.
No one is indispensable.
Are you here?
Everyone else laughed.
How many nights will you stay?
Did you see the guy in this picture?
I've lost my stuff.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake Tom.
My son's in economics.
The sky looks like snow can start tonight.
How much will it cost?
You know exactly what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop Kashi.
I want Tom to be happy.
Those who live in houses of glass should not break rocks.
Why are you crying?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to the hospital.
Tom wants his hat back.
Is Tom home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'm eating an accident.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city was divided into a river east and west.
Come see for yourself.
Do you understand what he is saying?
I have to go to sleep.
You got a car?
Tom also plays guitar.
Are you thinking about doing something now?
He's launching now.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
This tooth is hurting.
How many are these lights?
How much more do we have to give?
Everyone liked Tom.
What happened here?
Here's your key.
Are you a Japanese citizen?
Let's go. Let's go.
Eat whatever you like.
Take this.
Have you ever broken your bones?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't walk my right cheek.
I'm thirsty.
How old are you?
Can I ask you a question?
What's that?
Here's your key.
We've seen worse things.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What's that?
He's eating.
Gargosh likes Gaza.
You don't understand.
My mother's in pain.
Sit on the table.
He's smaller than me.
What is your name?
We were waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use the credit card?
It's a big night, isn't it?
This book can only be found in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I afford a credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went home to Jackson.
He wore a black hat.
Anything else?
Everybody's shaking.
Is there anything left for the students?
I'm eating Nudals.
Tom's inside the house.
Don't ask what they're like, ask what they're doing.
Will you come inside?
I'm telling you.
We like football.
Will you eat?
Good evening.
He ate empty fruit.
I want a new jacket for these shoes.
Everyone liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Enjoy.
Please listen!
He's running.
I'm going to take a shower, though.
My right shoulder is hurting.
My father was busy.
All ready to go.
I couldn't catch the 7,000.
There were two of his daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's talk.
Do you have a pen?
The class doesn't start before eight.
How long do you have to run?
What does that word mean?
How much can I get?
Can you speak English?
They're wrong about what they did.
My son is taller than me.
Tom's father-in-law was a singer.
Here you go.
Tom's alive.
She's showing him in the fax.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was angry.
How much is it?
You can eat as much as you want.
Let go.
I'm a little hot.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Please fill in.
How old are you?
Get Tom.
They're shaking.
You're shouting.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
I'll be back when I'm done.
I like the stars.
He's grown up in France.
He didn't work on Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
Three people were killed.
Don't eat anything but fruit.
Tom's father is a security guard.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
Now's the time.
I never forget.
Where's the door to the UA 111?
I'm broke.
Why are you shaking?
Tom wants his hat back.
How much time do you normally spend sleeping?
The two countries have signed an agreement between themselves.
I speak to Tom in French.
Tom's got eyes on him.
Could it be a gift app?
Tom's in the garage.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's smiling.
He hasn't come yet.
It's not mine.
Who's here?
He's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The terrorists left the prisoners.
I could have gone with you, but I didn't have time.
I've lost my maniac.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government has shut down Eyak.
Get out of the city!
Look up three times.
He's eating.
How old is that church?
Let's go!
This can be Japanese.
Did you see him drop?
How much did the shuttle bus leave for the airport?
Don't argue.
That's my bitch.
That's my bag.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've had a hard time.
We were walking around.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom yelled.
Tom's in a very low mood.
Eat whatever you want.
Tom's crying.
How much is it?
I'm fine.
They're doctors.
The plane's coming when it's right.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the viewers were businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom's probably asleep.
I've got a lot of money.
Tom won a lot of races.
He knows where we are.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
Tom, wash the lights.
Everyone yelled.
I'll stay outside.
My mom can have a good lunch.
They're shaking.
The investigation was successful.
I think Tom will be given the chance to keep the gold he's got.
Boston is a big city.
I'm 17.
Here's your key.
Leave Tom alone.
Eat your milk.
The name of the two of us is Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the puldanite?
Tom's hurt.
Follow Tom.
Is Tom still mad at me?
Tom's gone.
We were waiting for you.
I'm not drunk.
Do you know what he said?
Listen carefully.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you shouting?
What is your father’s name?
Look over there.
I'll let you know if I keep doing something.
We tried.
Tom resigned in October.
The market is next to the doctor's office.
Happy Canada Day!
I'll be late.
What does this sign mean?
Tom blew his head off.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's blue Anars.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen carefully.
Are you going to mess with me?
Take it easy.
They're there.
I'll sneeze.
Everybody cleans up.
Don't hurt me.
Who was it?
I'm Lajuk.
When I said Mary left town, Tom was really surprised.
I heard a scream.
How long is your plane?
He doesn't want to talk about it.
My book seemed attractive.
Tell me what happened.
I've been up for eight days today.
Please light the light.
Tom was hurt.
I'm still your friend.
It took me two hours more to translate some pages into English.
Are those yours?
Who is he?
Is this the least way to go to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
What are you doing to him?
It's impossible!
When does the train reach Yokohama?
How bad now?
Words that don't correct are not correct. You can provide more normal translations instead.
Your shoes are here.
Are you ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to cook for you.
Listen, does this train last for Washington Square?
We failed.
There's a C.I. in this house.
Did you bring the whole thing?
Tom Boston was gone.
Clean it up.
Don't open it.
Tom saw him.
The evening may snow.
I'm not proud of it.
Is there anyone there?
It's wrong.
I'm not young anymore.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Will you go fishing with us?
Wait right here.
I'll be back in half a minute.
One minute.
Tom was hurt.
Mary explained.
I don't deny it.
Don't look!
Do it as quickly as possible.
Use it.
When does the train reach Yokohama?
I don't understand that either.
I've been up for seven hours this morning.
I'm home.
Take it easy.
Good morning!
I'm inside.
Me, too.
I'm not too busy.
It's beautiful.
Do it again!
Tom started on the floor.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why aren't you going?" "Because I don't want to go."
I know that.
I'll stay close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
My feet are hurting.
Ask Tom.
I'm thinking about what I'm going to give you on my birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
It's good to see you again.
Why are you shouting?
Stay right there.
Eat what you like.
We were playing the park.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy tickets from?
I'm done.
I'm planning on staying at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started screaming.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom happy.
Don't get in there.
We're lost.
Tom's shaking.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm looking empty, thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We were waiting for them.
How old do I think I am?
Tom's not happy here.
He was angry.
I don't like coffee.
Talk more slowly.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to see Tom?
Here you go.
We don't do what he doesn't do.
I called my best friend Tom.
We can never play better than that.
We're cowards.
The bill will be buried today.
Tomorrow I'm going to Paris.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's wrong.
Eat whatever you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
