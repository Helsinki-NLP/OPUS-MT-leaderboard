A Republican strategy to hinder Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people dying because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, Republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what is happening in Canada, the United States is responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in the same line, a majority of American governments introduced new laws from 2009, which hampered the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon has been extended since the November 2010 elections, which saw an increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced during 2011 that restricted the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, these laws reduce the early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the election and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to submit an identity document with photography.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
As a result, the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit an identity document with photography.
It is important to note that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any identity document with a photograph issued by a government agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
However, obtaining the required identity document often costs more than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions therefore disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of those who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of those who are over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have an identity document with photography.
And there's more.
In many states, students, voters who vote the most for democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with photography issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states authorize members of the fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote to the Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required the citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present that requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit hispanic voting.
It seems that two out of every three Hispanic voters support the democratic party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported certain laws in 2011 that abolished the electoral registration on the same day of the election in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of persons and groups to create an aid service for voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of some 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have achieved that the registration rate of new voters falls in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that promoted the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 Florida elections, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter did not represent more than 13 per cent of the voters in the state.
In the case of Hispanics, exactly the same would happen.
These do not represent more than 11 per cent of voters, equivalent to 24 per cent of the citizens voting in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent no more than 46 per cent of the citizens voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, democratic governors have blocked a number of bills.
The United States Prosecutor's Department intervenes to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part it was possible to limit damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of an identity document with photography.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the participatory nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they intend to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A report by the Brennan Centre in 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too soon to confirm with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this regard, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostatic cancer detection: Is the test done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents incorrect results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which useless medical interventions are decided.
It is more than enough to make men doubt, already reluctant of themselves, whether or not the detection tests should be performed.
Do the test or not?
We've asked for advice from two specialists.
Studies in the United States detected a large number of infections among the sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who did not.
The study, followed by 12 years of age, also showed that between 30 and 40 per cent of the potential for metastasis had not been tested.
I therefore recommend the 50-year-old test, or the 40-year-old if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of his or her cancer. All possible options should be offered to him or her and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not address long-term life, in which case an active surveillance of the disease should be chosen.
Today many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since that cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest an active surveillance of the disease and, if this progress, we offer them treatment.
We have increasingly determined the necessary criteria to decide who should be treated or not.
I recommend that the test be carried out in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be performed.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urology Society, a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from the disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smokes, that rate would rise to at least 50%," underlined André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Society against Cancer.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It is very harmful to people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesperson André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced to half.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favour the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC.
The risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterine increases.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
Food
The Agency also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of suffering colorectal cancer.
Charcutery products should also be avoided.
Preservation of the meat for the smell, drying or salad may cause the formation of carcinogens.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," they explain.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the linkages between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their investigations are not conclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, the other was an increase in what was observed.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about the concerns and family backgrounds of each and every one with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
The Higgs box in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs boson caused a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is, in fact, believed that this boson is part of the responsible mechanism of the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicts the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But it's not completely clear to physicists that it's Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks much like the Higgs boson preached by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at an important physical congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there is still more data to be completely safe.
Anyway, let's assume that this is Higgs, because the chances of making a mistake seem small.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inevitable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that norm and do not try too much, because it will end up harming itself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law in it of these characteristics: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantic state"; a "state" which consists largely of some of its characteristics.
The physicists classify the particles in two categories.
On the one hand, we meet with good citizens called farmers, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And on the other hand are the boons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found at the same place and at the same time.
According to The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories, which is, by the way, extraordinary, the boons are divided into two groups: the moons, of which we will not talk here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature spread and with which Higgs' boson would be somehow related.
These bonnets, I could emphasize here, aren't the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extremely banal boson: the photon or "light particle" that acts as "messier" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" there is a electromagnetic wave (of light, of infrareds, of ultraviolets, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force carriers".
More stable field
The same happens with Higgs boson, with the difference that it is about another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" to make this boson appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it it needs to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond in which only a thick rock could slide around the surface.
That's why a huge particle accelerator like CERN (the great Hadron collisioner is a 27 km circumference ring!) is needed to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the magnets, do it, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never be kept by itself stuck to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the rest (as the photon, by the way) do not have it.
Now, what "may they bring" all those investigations?, Mrs. Plamond asks.
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to vote the differences between MS observations and predictions.
For their part, many want to be found fervably, because the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physical" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, you have to say, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (up!) or the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of such research on our day is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that there will be none.
To see: In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution their work would cause.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said earlier, who worked in Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the tools around the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light capturer in 1969 during his research on optics.
Although it was not at all its original intention, this capturer now serves as an "eye" for all the world's digital devices, which was worth the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that LHC's activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but that we never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In his Death in Dignity Commission, Quebec had recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed as soon as a draft law is prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Devor tried to find him.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Monterégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying her had given her a two-year breath.
"They had given me five years of life, but I've been so seven," he says, taking a walk, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center of Beloeil, which came the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has caused him damage: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of a delicious lunch, he accepts a resignation to help him eat.
Valiente, she even smiles, talks to strangers who give her attention, bring her medications and offer her a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is to be cured of diarrhea, it is humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found remedy for that evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man makes a floor," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the center of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he says.
Because, according to the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care centre suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses who surround them no longer offer "curative" care.
The greatest fear of Ms. A., 89 years old, is to die "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has made her children know.
"I have some good kids," he adds.
"I no longer have any wish in this life," he says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, for a last visit from your son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and help with food.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help her death be more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very small, because we all know we're gonna end up dying someday.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouth-to-mouth toys with brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, care director.
In the center of Victor-Gadbois the days go by without ever being equal.
Next to a 94-year-old man who tastes his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after trying everything to survive.
"Since six months ago, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of cancer disease," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarvent centre come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
A 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of his life, whether in his home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And a number of agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the palliative care society home to the Grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative shortage in Quebec's health care, which makes many doctors specialized in palliative care fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been operating to demonstrate their opposition to this initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
"Recently," he says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in emergency suffering great pain without doing what is necessary to relieve it.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate care."
And at the same time, many oncologists are opposed to their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard’s survival expectations were already low when he left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that I was sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she said.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There are no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who claim to die are grateful to their caregivers who have not responded to their demands once they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful with regard to the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at Grand Montréal's home, patients do not respond to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually use palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until his or her death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering.
More and more, unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want relief."
This report has been made possible by means of a journalism scholarship from the Institutes of Health Research in Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fund collectors of political parties and specialists from the Italian mob count, day after day, what they know of a huge "system", which is part of the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias.
A "industry" that came out too expensive for Quebecan contributors, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's interesting how the system is sprayed once we've hunted the big media," ironically Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the escalation of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into the abuses of road contracts in Quebec, which the Prime Minister of that time, Jean Charest, had only agreed to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
"From the beginning of the research in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved billions of dollars in contracts," containing some of its instincts to remain with a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen to two mayors", he adds, while he hopes to be able to "demonstrate existing strategies behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies to its team of government interveners, investigators and analysts.
This unit is also operated by police from the "Marteau Squadra", which, since 2009, have made Montreal's "cartel of the cantarillad" move at the time of inflaming contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has been registering a series of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city outside.
Next to the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his mayor's post in Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that repeated fees have been paid in exchange for public contracts.
He has been formally accused of engineers of the Montreal route network and Italian-born entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurs and Lino Zambito.
The latter has been shocked to explain to the committee the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He paid for three years a 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia broker who transferred the money to the Montréal Union, the mayor's Gérald Tremblay party.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to the right and the left during the 2000s, giving more than $88,000 to provincial parties, especially to liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of accumulating contracts
In Montreal, the corruption system worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, an engineer of public works, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and corporate bribes from the construction sector for a total of $736.000, all of this in exchange for contracts that cost him.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflaming invoices between 30 per cent and 40 per cent for false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately taking a look at a parallel budget and filled his pockets with dirty money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early in November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected policies to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the eastern part of the island, he has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land acquired for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million to the promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of the money in the electoral campaigns was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, it ensures that it "takes off a thread so that it can understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and fish the guilty".
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive".
We are cleaning the wounds but we would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very careful not to repeat the questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of the "elected politicians" in the stream of strategy."
Estimates by 70% the proportion of dirty money that was spent on funding electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically says: "I have been told that this is no more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to it, "until the electoral costs are strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics".
It calls for a complete revision of the public procurement and party financing system: "We cannot fall further; we can go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws".
If this story pushes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who would look at the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would that advance explain?
It could be explained by an individual awareness take, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Progress day by day next to you.
The technical staff has also brought me much.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
It's all going very fast at football.
But I don't feel good.
From my beginnings in the preforming center of INF Clairefontaine to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed to urgent steps.
It will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to fighting very high-level parties.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me much in terms of my positioning.
He is supported by associates like Claude Makele, who played in the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, no one is equal in League 1 and is among the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with the best clubs.
He's been working with big players.
I think other titles will be taken to Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken our lead.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the League of Champions: we have classified ourselves for the eighths in style.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say to many and very good European teams.
We want to finish the first of our league against the Opportunity in order to be able to receive the turn of eighths at the end.
Can the GSP become a large European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the GSP is committed to its resources to ensure that the project is implemented.
Not to win the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we're going to invest all our efforts to bring us that championship title.
We haven't gotten far in the last season.
In May we were disappointed because we had the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We ended up with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year, I think it'll be good.
Even if the big teams like Marseilles, Lyons and Burdeos are fighting for the title, I think we're dealing with the guns to take him away.
Do you think the media are waiting for more than the PSG?
It is normal for many of us to expect if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at Troyes' house, they still meet with things that insult us is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 all weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have demonstrated that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City that, after two seasons, has not managed to qualify for eighths in the end, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage per day.
That would be to neglect our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marcella, who were not well in the previous season, have been "impulsed" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is passionate.
I hope in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished taking the trophy.
The PSG seems entirely dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's better to say we have a "Zlatandependence."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and has many goals.
He has come to demonstrate that he is the star of League 1.
And he's proved on all the teams he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you live Eurocopa 2012 with the team of France?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things there and I went out reinforced.
Today I can play good games in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and we must have exemplary behavior today.
What view do you have of Didier Deshamps' first month in front of the Blues?
It's getting results.
They are well located in the World Classification Group.
The selector is strict, close to the players and inspires to win.
Like Laurent Blanc's case.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deshamps leads to the selection in Brazil.
Did the empathe (1-1) of 16 October in Spain serve as a basis?
That game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not lived a game like that in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
All contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, transactions identified and processing charges between the parties.
In addition, as often happens in technologies, political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, composed of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to.
About 200,000 transactions have been recorded through 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as forms of payment.
The rate of bitcoin, after reaching the top of 30 dollars (EUR 23) in June 2011, fell to $2,5 months later, before returning to round the ten dollars today (the rates are quoted on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is no wonder that we compare it to global changes in real money or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other systems with virtual currency types such as "credit" used to move forward in a video game and that can be won by playing or can be bought (and even at times change).
The social network Facebook also developed this kind of system.
But in any exchange, a central authority controls and deals with the changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositaries of books of accounting, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins changes are contained in the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key feature is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file sharing, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "couple" the new transaction and add a number before "couple" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular score (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is good.
The transaction is then indestructiblely linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any change would change the score.
If, in order to commit a fraud, one user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would accept only as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge is 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in the power of calculation.
The life of the network already has its heights.
The websites that offer Bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The error used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounting and showed that about 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November the "magnificent beads" were launched.
"The $30,000 have been changed," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who turns the bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, the author of a pedagogical book on that currency, believes a lot about the potential of this technology as well as about the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to put into business, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
Just provide you with an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", requires Pierre Noizat, who assures you that there are thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"There will be a time to impose Bitcoin, but there could be a change in 2013," he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the ECB intends to re-evaluate the various risks, which are considered high today, if this currency succeeds.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for anything from us.
We have, above all, punished the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, more wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugees in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if the Yihadists, the Pakistani, the Arabs, the Uzbek or the Tajiks join in their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even assisted by local insurgents, these will no longer be when the Westerns become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from above the hills planted by almonds thanks to the French credits, was ordered.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attack, monitored by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistable advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Its control of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants overrun by Al-Qaeda, but their situation is not better today.
The old multi-Ahids, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making use of government land to resell them as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the pair of huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as well as those who have learned to take advantage of American generosity: capital leakage is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under 25 years of age, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, state colleges are full of both girls and children.
There will have to be work for those young people who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile phones. Turkish television and its brochures that feature a modern world have great admirers all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstituting provincial militias, which will flee the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to turn it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, removing the position of the prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular on the basis of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, their country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no embalming has been fixed, and important irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing happens except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country devastated after 30 years of war, government control would have been required.
The rumor that Afghanistan had huge mining wealth was widened.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take hold of them.
No energy to extract the iron or copper minerals from the ground and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned Mes Aynak copper mines, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up the huge Buddhist location and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country heavily dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore their normal relations.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: schools of girls, schools of children, a department of French at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "beat the hearts and the spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, brought and made through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation activities in dozens of mountain locations.
These works, greedy for local work, have been able to help contain insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cultivation surfaces.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military expenditure?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want to do, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled, and direct civil aid.
A Constitution with strengths in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever with regard to the constitutional declaration, which provisionally gives it full powers, he decided to play everything.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given that Assembly two months more to finish his work.
And nearly two years ago, Egypt used a provisional text, several times modified, which undermines institutional stability and leads to judicial error.
This new initiative has only increased fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president persevered in his "autocratic delirium" and continued "traiting his word" and "putting the right".
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis more quickly and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time forcing the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, this is also a way of restoring popular and democratic legitimacy while the debate causes damage throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview with the American Weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or I vote my text or keep the full powers", powers which are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in their vast majority, voted yesterday.
Most of the liberals didn't turn to the summons.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not make their views worth.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added yesterday morning at all speeds.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brothers.
As I expected, the articles voted unanimously.
The commentators are grateful, on the other hand, that one of the few disagreements of the day has been expressed almost at the time of prayer, so that a number of committee members have come to think that the constitutional clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 is the subject of all views, and is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulates that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "standards", which would have allowed a more stringent application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals touch it with hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than a advertising craft.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its compliance with Sharia's laws.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the preeminences of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are also compounded by the fact that the next principal of the university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no specific religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have been working on this text are not academics, some of them formed in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, since the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be to what extent civil judges are competent to pronounce themselves over all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms concerning the extended powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers will claim that they are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflict: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Civilian proceedings in military courts, as requested by human rights associations, will not be prohibited.
They also showed concern about the text, which they considered to be libertarian.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially those of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, underscoring Heba Morayef, of the Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive was the prohibition of torture in accordance with Article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to go out last night on television, events are scheduled for this afternoon.
The leaders of the head of state showed up on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the world's obligation and a sea of salmon
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and natural beauty.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine into the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the nets filled.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But most of the holy places are located in Jerusalem.
The believers go on the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Blessing View").
Beginning in the Fortaleza of Antonio, the Pretoria, where the trial was carried out, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre in the Golgotha Mount, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Union and the place of the burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Obligo of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in a place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree of which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As is tradition, people from different religions leave here notes with their wishes, which will then be realized.
Perform a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in the year 25 C.E. for his family.
They are located in the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And get there by their own means, they can only those who are dedicated to climbing.
The others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermón ski resort, where in the winter months there is a great flow of tourists.
Up to there, bus services are offered from the foot of the hill.
The total length of ski tracks is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit them all on one trip.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It contains the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean wilderness, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has licenses from impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bathroom, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish bathrooms with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive Ralli private museum, where the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí can be admired.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
The entrance is free, and categorically donations are not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
Into it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And they dream of the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is interesting that even in the winter months they are bathed in the Red Sea, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and they swim there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a salmon that easily sustain up to those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to take treatment courses with salt water, salmon and curative stones and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to arrange their broken nerves.
Playing Ancient Mysteries
They are preserved by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it was the famous sea route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Persia rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of Zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "mysm" symbol, fortune will favor you.
In Jaffa, newly married couples from all over Israel, and even other countries, can be found.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the strength of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Poncio Pilato.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists Remember
If he travels to Israel, he does not worry if his English leaves much to wish: in this country about 30 per cent of the Russian population speaks.
Money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shequels (currently $1-3.8 shequels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast traffic and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Low City with the High City.
In fact, it's from a underground funicular.
Traveling in any type of public transport costs 6 Shekels and for this price you can travel by transshipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated.
From Friday night to the setting of the sun on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts its work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only served kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes where milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of beef and sheep meat dishes, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are soft garbanzo balls, fruits and vegetables.
There are no street dogs in the streets of the Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well fed cats that "pass to their taste" in an impressive way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the parked cars.
The roners love the places they competed for and did not reject the golosins.
Car rental, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it goes out for $15 a day.
And the rent of a bicycle will go out for 15 shekels a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in Numbers
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists around the world.
Most of those who came to travel and rest were U.S. citizens, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which exceeds 51% in the same index of 2010, before the visa regime was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will lead you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While MPs and human rights defenders are discussing the consequences of the law on compulsory review, it has already appeared in the country of timers trading with "false" certificates.
Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to earn money to help your families who have stayed at home.
As from 1 December, a law enters into force whereby each migrant worker must carry out an examination to check his knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector, Community services institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the examinations will be mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it would not be enough to give consideration to the language, if not also to the Russian history and the fundamentals of legislation.
The knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens from countries where Russian is the official language are excluded.
Persons who obtained their education and diplomas prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Utility, mortality and defence of rights
The network of review centres will be hosted by the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of Friendship of the Peoples, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can present themselves to the trials in all cities, and now more than 160 such centres are open in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the members of the State Duma and by the Federal Immigration Service.
But the rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask this question to the press: What will this actually bring?
What changes will the obligation of language knowledge, both for Russians and immigrants themselves, bring?
First of all, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from “labour slavery”.
Many people today talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90 per cent of cases.
Immigrants have problems without profession, education, who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, with the pretext of helping, put a "paid journey" to a spleen and narrow cove, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise something, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they do not pay their promised wages," says Tolib Sharipov, head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Tajikistan Immigration Service.
Don't get mad, boss!
However, while so many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that they not only know the language of the country they intend to go to but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much his fault but his own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to give children to eat because they don't talk about getting dressed, getting dressed and buying them what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these boys venture to work on the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the law on language, rights defenders point out an important point.
The examinations shall be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no review and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or forbid the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not that easy.
The cause is in bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a fake inscription can be made quickly and for only a thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we generally carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov, told reporters.
"Come on, don't be silly, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was demonstrated that not only immigrant registration documents could be false.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The falsified documents had been printed in standard colour printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wishing to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is twice as expensive as the official review procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that the " diplomas" cannot be bought, convert government officials and rights defenders.
To date, the authorities may promise migrant workers who could not have passed the exam for the first time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite reduced
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to implement the law with greater rigour in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: To catch shots during weddings in which there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which seven persons were killed.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatized weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years of age.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the arms possession law will be brought to the Duma of the State in the near future.
Not all are happy that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard hand policy".
There has been an open letter on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social associations of shooters, demand that such measures of "unreasonable rigour" be abandoned.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, reported to the news service of Russia's BBC, criminal lawyer Vasily Lésnikov.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 crimes were committed during the six months of 2012 using firearms registered in internal organs, compared with a total of 1168 reported crimes for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that more stringent legislation in the civil use arms sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the Higher State.
Screenshot of the website accepting gun requests
The first, "military or military vestige", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were torn by the Russian officers and the same Caucasians," Baranets says.
The following type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go out for sale from the military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the lack," says an exile.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also place their sand granite.
"Now they have distributed private arms factories that are not competitive on the international market and distribute weapons under the black market, including that of Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Many guns and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes handicrafts, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of illicit arms supply to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the black market's weapons have arrived there "on account of officials whose work is related to weapons", the report says.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places where armed conflicts exist, 14 per cent of cases are stolen during arms production and 5 per cent are related to “illegal archaeology”.
Depending on one of the arms stores, which requested that its name be not mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal diggers have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a match.
Through some metaphor, the supplier buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the valley.
"This brings the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two chargers," we tell.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime detection plan has to be carried out, they make trial purchases to illegal arms traders," the dependent adds.
"As in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who suggested to me was on the platform "Begovaya", where I would be a man who would lead me to a "squin" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I'll only get there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the dealer in the store. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
There are sellers in the markets, but there is also a need to get there, let's say "on behalf of Mr. Ivanovich, who asked you to tell him that a tooth had fallen on his daughter".
I can even get a pair of steel sleeves through a trusted person.
He also provides me only because he knows I'm not going to delve.
The new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Ex-military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s when an article on this subject was available.
The schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was no "of all".
"I felt like in a luxury boutique," the military recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranets, does not offer a cat for free: everything there is can be tested.
I, as a potential customer, don't just buy; let's go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
"It gives me the chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa Store
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where we offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal encounters are required for this purpose.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the headline "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
There the users make their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"No permission, of course," asks the user "Iván" (conserved spelling).
"I buy a gun TT. Moscow," laconically puts his question "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures in two hands those who want to buy firearms.
And the people went, like hungry fish, to the liver, and then to extract coals in Siberia.
military commentator and exile Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: generally, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the gun is hidden," reports the NGO Press Secretary "The Right to Weapons", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is made, one remains unarmed and puts him in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures in two hands those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the pond, and then to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from $100 to $900.
According to the NGO's Dmitri Kislov "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
A month and a half should be expected.
It is shipped from military warehouses by middle-ranking bosses.
According to official ministry statistics, compared to January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, which represents 22,900, and the number of cases identified as theft and extermination of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7,8 per cent.
The employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the United States are hit.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald's"
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has been launched in the United States that are paid in the Walmart corporation supermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Vendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to see whether or not this wave will arrive at the nine points, or if it is intended to lose strength and start in its first stages.
The protests have the support of trade unions and a number of NGOs on the left.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the aim of the protest organizers is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday". That day, in the United States, they started the herding organ that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
That day, some employees of the Walmart Corporation, who employ 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed protests with trade unions and left-wing activists in corporate stores, whose products are directed to modest and moderate income people.
Walmart sells everything from pants, hunting rifles and car batteries, even vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in their stores are between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid Walmart workers only buy at work.
The availability and exit of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford the luxury of selling products at a very low price, partly because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about the poor working conditions, such as the lack of mountings or hand scanners.
Those "Black Fridays" participants in the event demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expenditure is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on consumers' shoulders, each visit to the store will result in only 46 cents more expensive.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they now spend.
Walmart's supporters are pleased that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" was extended in its shops from 8 a.m. on Thursday afternoon to midnight on the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, their registrations carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the Huffington Post Left Website, that they left their "less than five" jobs in Walmart and that the protest had not been more than "other public relations trick", organized by the workers' union.
"Get out of here!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the goals were not exactly the big Walmart stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and therefore there is no one for now), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells thousands of millions of portions, and then they don't even give you the discount for illness and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, under federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants will increase over time, but only slightly, and on average, regular workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one wants less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, it's something incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers passed through McDonald's and worked there, behind the indicators, in part time after school, even though they were still living with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live from this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum in the Wall Street Journal magazine, there is a comment that the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to eat with.
The participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's at 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast food cooks and cooks start paying them at least $15 per hour, i.e. that their current minimum wage be doubled.
They also demanded that workers' unions be created in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing the activists of the union movement with arguments and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main is the excessive rotation of staff.
Distortions
Noisey protests took place that same day at other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the action took place at half the Mitin in McDonald's near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians participated, in particular the member of Jumaane Williams City Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's says he's selling thousands of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
Protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support fast food workers in order to get fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves".
As the New York Times described it, this has been the biggest manifestation of this type in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employed in the fast food service, where tens of thousands of people from New York work.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to cause a massive movement.
"For now, cheating on the brain is not so easy."
The topic of increased reality, so popular among those who are interested in modern technologies, is recently perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at his annual Google conference, he demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was assumed that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in the Microsoft Cambridge laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it was found that for scientists of that company, the glasses were already part of a past stage.
They are drawn to the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group?
- We are committed to personal-computer interaction, but we are also trying to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now mankind in its great mass has been caught in the working phase with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with its finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as they are all interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design systems.
The world of computer technology must be released to our, to our physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, the devil with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they're overestimating it?
Of course, you cannot be considered a panacea, it is still pending to resolve the issue of privacy, since you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each one in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not of loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured, not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a bracelet watch.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- Or do you want to force users to adapt to what they can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person's reactions.
These can, for example, be laser sensors, as they provide a good deep resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do you lack resolution, depth, or anything else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
I mean, we have to remember not only the resolution on X and Y axes, but also on Z.
It is also important to speed, number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and can be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects human-machine interaction.
To me, it would be very useful for my work to have an equivalent of that device, but that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "camera", one of which is actually the infrared beam emitter and the second receiver of the signal reflected.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible slide.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the camera location curve and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- So I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, he hasn't presented his glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of increased technologies of reality, glass is one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smart phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smart phone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in which is your strength (the private things only you can see them), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tangible answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my conferences I often say that the increased reality is the seventh interruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could well be the addition of touchy sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really geared towards bringing tangibleity to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is given a similar feeling that one feels if someone was supplanting it in the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrists for the doll that influence the nervous endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
To make him think he feels what he seems to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he goes to an open space, almost endlessly. We are also working on the idea of racing tapes (not like those of gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as those of the giant globes.
For now, deception in the brain is not so easy, it still has to work for many years.
That is what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, which many things are in a state of complete conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens facing, to the vanguard of art and culture.
In this list of the best there are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known to Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above, to whom you can find near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, where they want to be displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophists of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg ' s vanguardism at the end of the 80 ' s.90s.
In addition, he is a urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens in the smiling inhabitants and lifts up all the mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organ and became the organist of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, because of his Bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going to the town dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment between the artist, the creator of images and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a bit gray provokes aggression and agitation of property is nothing good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
- When did you understand you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Culture Palace, where my works were shown.
I realized that was my way.
Then the flow of old non-official artists had ended, and the new, free ones like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with those who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was over.
I joined the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
It was important for me to meet at the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohemian St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to "The Van Gogh Ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore adjusted pants, among them was the currently fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to play live, it became "Leniningrad."
Trachenberg was an encouragement to many programs before the times of Hali-galivskik.
We told Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboydov", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and clients there.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was conducted in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the current and the occurrence.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Payas".
The strawberries are a temporary category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like this is painful and scary.
But in the pajamas everything becomes pregnant and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and mandatory change of clothing.
Now one is followed by the clothes, oriented outwards, but not inside the person.
And maybe that person shouldn't be given his hand, but spit it on his face.
And deception will be eliminated when it changes clothes.
We recently saw you in the role of urban organist.
Who better than me to be!
- All right, but can commercial art best be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, touchy.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped into mansions, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the simple others.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunitys, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 ticket to like everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov they're coming for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And at a cultural event of 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything goes away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to lose what you have achieved.
When he was young, he made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end.
Now the concepts are often confused.
They say spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, they denied the money just to paint paintings.
I'm in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what does San Petersburg need?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: an official of culture.
But not all of them can be devoted to culture.
When kings were all right, the kings might not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they're closed, because they need experts at a higher level who properly evaluate these and open their way.
It is now enjoying the subjective personal taste.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, St. Petersburg?
- San Petersburg is not a cultural capital. There is much more culture in Moscow, there is land.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural land and now we have more writers than readers, this is bad.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious about showings and concerts.
In our case, this class is infinite.
We have to make art out of fashion, as it was in the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Light in the space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Spaceship caravans with humans on board leave looking for a spare planet.
To preserve humanity is asked the main question: How to continue the species in conditions of pregnancy or on the same planet of spare?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in Venus orbit... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with the flower were started.
Half a century ago experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of guisantes cultivated in orbit were not different in any earthly variety.
Then came the creation of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, drosophiles.
In 1979 they were sent to the codorniz egg space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of pregnancy.
We get a normal contaminant as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this contaminant has to find support, it must stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems Laboratory (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When no support was found, the contaminants returned at random.
And after 10 hours in the newborns, a total atrophy of the instincts was given.
Pollutants did not react to light or to sound.
And the tragedy was that at the end of four days they just died.
"And twice we managed to have the contaminants born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the contaminants in space.
The last time a biological miniarca flew to orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion", only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
At first, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, when they lose their habitual habit, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
However, unlike small animals, man can in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have traveled to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our gaviota flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it's after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," comments the veteran of the Vakhtang Vachnadze aerospace sector.
In June 1964, only after a year of flying to space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was in orbit twice and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are told who after long flights have all worked well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, Soviet Union hero, Russian hero, Valery Polyakov.
However, mankind must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydro-laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
Under zero floating conditions, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates pregnancy.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is its natural element.
The small amphibians seem to confirm that life on earth came from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months within its mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier to get used to the water later.
At first, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the time of the first bath only lasts 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, a recently born swim monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, women need gravity, force of gravity.
In pregnancy, abdominal and pelvis muscles are decoupled very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we missed that, trusting in the action of birth-stimulators.
You can, of course, light up in a special camera, and it will push it.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyakov asked this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn born in orbit is impossible to wear with a special training suit, such as adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we're going to do together, allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead us to bring the Earth to a disabled person, to a totally inadequate person," says Igor Pestov, head of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, in time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Chief of NKU: The inspection of the "svarc" system has not been done with the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is limited.
Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (NKU) said so in an interview for Aktuální.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we are missing," so describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, mention Petr Neczas's attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on the paper, which is known as the "swarc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors.
"The law must be regulated in some way and if anything is prohibited in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the operation of the office which has an obligation to carry out such controls or to require obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee at the Congress of Members, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German teams, which compared public procurement legislation in both countries.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started carrying out about two years ago.
This is simplified: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, and this is followed by existing legislation in each country and then by practice in itself.
We have brought it all together and, although control has not yet been completed, we have achieved very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "more strict and more complete", however, concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate ever more stringent rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What can actually contribute to this project? What do you think the conclusions are?
It is precisely a common control of this kind that could help us stop investing in the realization of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of saving means getting a good thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal action.
But not because of the reduction of the limit of the award means that we are going to achieve it.
Maybe because the system is saturated with so much "papelleo", that those who want to find bugs on the system can do it more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You are talking about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it otherwise organized?
How many offices, such as the NKU, there operate the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Tribunal of Accounts), with a similar organization to ours, with a college too, is that in your case it is structured in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices evolve simultaneously.
The powers are also to some extent analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of account are even at this level.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control the federal money, which we call state funds here.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors there in Germany.
With regard to local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to establish a comparison without specific data. However, Germany is still a model in some respects, but it cannot be precisely specified in what is best.
Could it be better, for example, as regards the quality of inspectors?
I'm sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make this kind of comparison.
It must be said that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it wasn't for that, they wouldn't have any benefit from collaborating with our office, would they?
With regard to our country's legislation, what did the amendment of the Public Procurement Law mean to your Office? Is it somehow demonstrated?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been demonstrated in the control actions.
Since we carry out ex post checks, we need to have a certain delay.
For the time being, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new tool of "non-economic risk detection", by which we have made almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of selection and similar process are corrected.
Does it consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, that it constitutes a circumvention of the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "hardens" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already with the previous legislation, controlled persons were bound to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and each non-compliance with public procurement law meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who wish to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal error, which does not affect decision-making.
A system of this kind will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this path leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS would not bother businessmen with controls of the so-called švarc system, referring to being autonomous only on the paper. What does this mean?
Is the Schwarc system forbidden or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if anything is prohibited, then not even the Prime Minister of the Government can prevent the Office from acting that has an obligation to carry out such controls and to require obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we'll do it like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, legislation is quite strict about how formal action should be taken, and this is how it should be to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer for failing to meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct.
Roads have ice plates, although most roads are transitible
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are transitible, in some cases caution should be increased.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitible, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will rise between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
He has stopped snowing in the region and in the lower areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, snow in the crusts of the Metal Mountains reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the road traffic control centre in the region.
The fast R6 and the first category road in the region are now transmissible without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially in some bridges whose surface may be frozen and resbaladiz.
All roads of the second and third categories, including mountain roads, are also transmissible.
However, in some of them there are still layers of ice and apron snow.
There is a need for increased road attention, especially in the higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some roads of eastern Bohemia there is a danger of ice and in higher areas and in the mountains there may have been a snow cover on the roads, inform the Road and Highway Directorate on their pages.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger of ice-plates, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice creams can be produced in the immediate vicinity of Lanškrona, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysoköh Myta, and especially in the second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There is snow especially on the roads of the Giant Mountains in Orlicke Mountains.
There is a snowboarded layer of snow in the highest road areas in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will be now between the clear and partly cloudy, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will generally fluctuate between three low zeros and a positive degree, blowing a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are transitable today, although caution must be increased and it will be necessary to adapt to time.
In the early hours of the morning there will be ice, temperatures will rise between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent fall of the temperatures, some roads could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will meet with fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what is revealed from the information from the road operations control centre in the region.
The D5 motorway is transitable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The surface of most of the first category roads is dry and without ice.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road border with Germany there may be ice boards.
The second and third categories are wet, so in this case it is also warned of ice-plate frames.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the least transited roads in the Shumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will meet with partially dry snow.
After chemical treatment, snow remained in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský krīž.
Road operators took off the snow during the night; on the Schumper road some three centimeters of snow were accumulated, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transmissible without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of Schumper's road, there are snows left.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will meet with medium-dried snow towards Jeseník," a road manager from Šumper to ČTK has confirmed today.
On the ground and at night their colleagues also came to Jesenicka and, after chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now cleared and milled.
On the Olomouc road, roads are transmissible without restrictions, in the Šternberská road, drivers should drive carefully in the forest plots, where the roads remain wet.
Region of Ustí nad Labem and Region of Liberec
The road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications in different sections at first hour of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or iced, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
The temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lowest areas, so the ice and snow obviously remain in the footwear. Instead, in the lowest areas, especially in the south-east of the Czech Central Massice, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been reported by the mother.
Road operators have warned of the ice presence in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow is expected to melt and in the night the sky will be cleared and it will be iced.
From the general roads, unfavourable conditions have been announced on road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut down by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarming news that we like to catch.
The music group The Tap Tap likes to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you will organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state-owned act we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential at the end of the May calendar set out for 21 December at 11:10 in the morning.
On the previous day, on December 20 at 21 a.m., we will hold 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end about the same time as the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who's got this idea?
At first it was my idea, then we were all forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of May calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be bought at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called hymn against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the world, cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear it at beneficial concerts?
Of course, and it will be just the last, good, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All interpreters will sing it at the same time at the three concerts.
The hymns will be linked together at the same time thanks to the special live re-transmission on Czech television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the video clip, where Xindl X also sings...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial acts and concerts...
Let us make all our effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested in and share their interest in working with us.
What will be the focus of the money collected in concerts against the end of the world?
The equipment for the educational centre without barriers Studio, which we carry out in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedlijkov štav.
The students at Jedlijkov štst school regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they perform fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have enough economic means to pay teachers and we make an effort to do so.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedlijkov štst, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
There are several groups and interpreters at each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will play Chinese, Support Lesbiens, Illustratesphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, see www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other "spectacular action" in the future?
In May we will act for the first time at the Pražské Jaro festival, so here we will certainly prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
The coming year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and me, personally, taking advantage of our being in the United States, I would like to complete it with actions in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group formed by people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not that hard how it might look at first sight.
There are five members in the electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far, we have managed them well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to surprise me.
Even in Moscow, where we came back a little while ago, everything came out without any problems.
Thanks to abroad, you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is much way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still no frequent movement of a person alone by the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as, for example, giving preference to someone in the wheelchair on the elevator, there is no.
Fortunately, a civil association has been established which strives to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're going after...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on those directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with serious disabilities to be moved on their behalf in public and can go to the service, to the museum, where they want to...
But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate in social life actively, in this respect, with The Tap Tap we go a little ahead!
A respectful or unhindered society is one thing, but when the time comes when prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come out, it will start to change everything really.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a great force of will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years back, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator at Jedlikków estst, where I had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I'm a musician, I play, among other things, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a workmate.
And in time, as our moderator Ládja Angelovich says, we went a little bit of our hands (Laughter).
However, popularity hasn't come to these last years, am I wrong?
It is true that it has helped us quite well to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We conclude that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can also allow ourselves to be taught quality, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something else can be done.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its way, that everything new is taken with caution and takes a long time to accept it.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, is a natural reaction...
But compassion is completely superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it's not just an advance for them, it's for the whole society.
Did you help the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do a quality job, we must be strict in many aspects and require certain discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they realize they have to go two days to try, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
Currently the The Tap Tap group has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't avoid it.
Anyone willing and willing will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 a.m.
Incheba Arena de Prague, Fléda de Brno and Plynojem will take place in Ostrava and will participate in 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected at the end of the evening through videoconference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to pool the resources necessary to finance multifunctional equipment from the educational centre without barriers STUDEO in Jedlikków štav de Prague, whose cost is 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years of age have free access to the pre-sale option in Bohemiticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of European Space Agency Ministers last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of the ESA. It is the second member of the ESA of the former Eastern Europe bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began to work closely with ESA in 1994 and participated in the Agency's project commission over the years.
However, Poland’s journey to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already devoted to flying to space before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at Warsaw's astronomical observatory in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneer study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the indifferent assistants and, years later, Šternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch award in France for his "Introduction to cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a major driving force for astronomy and cosmonautism.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known worldwide and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was placed on one of the hidden faces of the moon.
Already in 1925 a train was built in Poland that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the project's findings are not known either.
It is not clear whether the rocket would be used for the start of the train or for its braking.
Information on this dress is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
Starting in 1933, the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to the missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Armaenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawe Wolfkem and Prof. Gustave Mokrzyckiegim.
On the basis of the preserved material, it is evident that the investigation has reached the stage of the practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photo-electric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohozinski appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpeda poietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Association of Astronautiques (Polskie Towarzystó Astronautique).
The November 1954 issue of the magazine Problemy first refers to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronauts.
In one of them, by Prof. Mr. Subotowicze, it was proposed to create a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
From the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) aspired to form part of the International Astronautic Federation (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He performed this duty until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM probe rocket (Meteorological Rocket), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had an apex of 1,800 metres, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg of weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and two-stage RM-2 rockets started in the Błędów desert in the summer of 1959.
The rocket averaged 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket would be the object of a real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket would have an apex of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the wind of altitude.
However, the work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from the available space for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for volume was 0.4 litres, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air test started in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km high.
Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were subsequently built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the space exploration of Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Works Act is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the Social Bar Association Act.
The resolution sparked a heated debate in society.
It will then be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, like in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and less normative competition.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.
The case lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with uninterrupted financial speculation.
The effect of major differences in labour costs (wage) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and thus "causes a low" of the competitor's price with the aim of making itself with most of the market and thus increasing its profit margin.
For most entrepreneurs it means moving production abroad, buying cheaper or disappearing there. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, it is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, it is necessarily the social expense of the state.
This whole situation is conducive to the total disinterest of entrepreneurs in paying taxes and in compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in order to benefit.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
Non-scrupulous private capital practices create situations in certain economies in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own population without taking social decline into account.
This is particularly evident in the changes to existing laws.
The aim is to compel the population to accept the private capital dictatorship, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees in respect of labour rights.
The result is an increasing poverty along with the increase in the differences between the poor and the rich.
Since a number of years ago, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid already reaches the million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed with such a low wage that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum essential to survive.
A scandal of this kind was made public with regard to the situation of assistant employees of the German federal parliament.
The saving measures of virtually all the states of the south of the EU lead, without a doubt, to the same situation: people who are pressured by a decline in their social level are forced to migrate as in the 19th century or to suffer at the worst wages in society, hoping that someday they will reach the private capital country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, poverty goes from one country to another or never comes, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for an infinite part of a European wage.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to the wisdom that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, which leads to its failure to lead the economy.
The private capital defends with nails and teeth thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by introducing itself into control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital is not influenced by its selfishness in the political process and therefore throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly yes.
The evidence is the existence of lobbies, in very powerful and omnipresent practice, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, in mutual favour, in legislation that is virtually reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, without financial resources, are responsible for drafting bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is then adopted on the Bundestag, the German Parliament.
Thus, not all power emanates from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation like the one described by Appian in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had time to disintegrate and the administrations took care of the force."
In exchange for bribes, benefits obtained illegally and help finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption were unimpeded, and people went to the urns with the voice spoken in advance"... "there were no people of a character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consulates"... "He began to speak seriously that the only remedy for such a situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appian thought in Pompey, Caesar ascended to power and transformed democracy forever into an autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in the past, is that the present society is based on disregarded preferences of the individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is, in essence, unable to understand and claim the benefits of the entire society.
The result is the same as that since then, a decline in the unprecedented elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the increase in fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought for the smooth liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy, as a defined pause, pending the next blow.
The fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the Public Procurement Act is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and within the EU, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to look for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen the participation of the state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the position of the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the chaos lab.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (nothing comes from violence and nothing could do it), Sting in his song Fragile and whose stribille prays "Let's not forget how fragile we are" (we do not forget the fragiles we are).
"If my children didn't want wars, there would be no" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his bed of death in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have always been various reactions.
One, on the side of Israel, argues in favour of the right to self-defence and enlists Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports Palestinians and claims racism by the State of Israel, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and targeted Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of repeated killings and who is the victim. Finally, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginning of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the ceiling, a look to find out who benefits from the tensions that have been drawn for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small area of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, on who or which group of people is the main driving force behind the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity the history of struggles for power is at the forefront.
At each time we can find a Magno Alejandro or Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always those who led their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who was directing their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in a time that concentrates the wealth of the world on the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been achieved in one generation.
Of these astronomically rich families, one could be considered the most prominent (if there is anyone still behind, I do not know, but I do not reject it): the Rothschilds.
You don't write much about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with criminal acts of great seriousness. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which always meant strengthening for them.
They have important participations in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, have been declared or are preparing for war: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the defeat of Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has suspended the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Bank of Rothschild Central America, began to print money during the War of Secession and was murdered in 1865 in the theater.
JFK started printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to claim the FED for triggering the big economic crisis of 1929.
His aphan by the world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchy states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially from Britain, and the third proposed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and one billion people (like a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary project for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschilds, operates, follows the dynamics of the triggering of crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a deterioration of the situation. Otherwise, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after that, as a result, the First World War was triggered, Russia was devastated by the start of the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I suddenly and unwarrantedly ended from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end the Assyrian Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent demise of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungary Empire.
In order to prepare for World War II, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a hidden way, a conflictous situation following the huge war repairs imposed on Germany, with which the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the poor masses were created. Later, they were sufficient to serve the Germans the solution of the Fuhrer, which was strong enough and simple and pointed to blame, and to build after a Czechoslovakia composed by several nationalities with a strong German minority that was supposed to represent and represent so well the function of the fifth column, which took the call and provoked the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschild promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned earlier laid the groundwork for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and started the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
He celebrated World War II: it is hard to know whether Hitler took too much of the rope that international bankers had attached to him in principle or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the best conditions for acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way in which the war repairs imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If the international bankers were able to initiate it, the Jewish nation, like in World War II, would become a front-line victim, now together with the Arab population or, generally, a Muslim of the Middle East.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within its own country, but also internationally. We take as an example how the sympathizers and detractors of Israel are divided in a touching way.
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice lead to injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at first there was the greed of some individuals and their greed for world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their mandatearies, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does all he can to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls Ormuz's tightness, where 20% of the world's oil passes (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the global economy.
Under what light are now shown the words that David Rockefeller made in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in your imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is placed a chip at birth that controls all his being.
"And compels all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on the right hand or on the front, not to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of its name.
It is necessary to understand this: whoever has two fingers in front, adding the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is sixty-sixty-six."
Argo Film: If you get rough, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamic students held the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
His release would be in exchange for the deranged Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored its regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive perspective: throwing the shah on the edge could not allow it, since, if it did, it would endanger the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified even more with the failed attempt to free hostages by force.
The prisoners were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the United States, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and encouragement against Iran.
The failure in Iran made a decisive contribution to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in front of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by the director and actor Ben Affleck thematicizes an episode of this story, which brought about a small success for America.
Shortly before the embassy was occupied, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated danger, they ended up living in the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, which helped a covert story to make an extravagance point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the cinematographic team that examined the country's location for superproduction of fiction science.
Combination of genders
The plan that the expert drew up in "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
To make the lie look true, the film project was written in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictitious production society even had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of various genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other hand, a so-called "caper motion", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines the mood states. We find well documented sequences of Tehran. The sequence of credits shows symbolic photographs of the time of the events, which were equally placed in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, Hollywood's typical scenes are a bit lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from the central CIA and other institutions: men who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, at the office halls, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the object of ridicule, has become a respected director and his way of acting has ceased to be the white of ironic comments.
Argo is his third long metre, after "Adios Small, Adios" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film of Affleck in which action has no place in the city of Boston, where it was created.
The sensitivity to capture the local atmosphere was also a characteristic of the directors of ancient films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Teheran will "rear" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy takes place is impressive because of its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of uncertainty and the lack of anticipation that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the imposing team in Tehran's base).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
It sometimes adds something to the reality: it doesn't come out so elegantly (the scene where the crisis at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America, and the search for its track becomes crazy).
Argo's softness is the discontrolling that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses some dramatic touch, but it is a film that can continue with a moderate interest, evaluate its performance and style back of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it collapses, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as evidence of the exaggeratedness that may be the notion of omnipresentity and omniscience of secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for the inflation of globes, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which presents an annual survey on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It happened to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 per cent share of women in positions of leadership in the major European companies," Právo Patrick Naher, the survey organizer, explained.
Among the absurdities identified is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women have benefited from better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Naher reported.
Among the controversial EU regulations are, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which results in environmental damage; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers throughout life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the dark direction of the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to a significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
The fact-finding ban has been criticised for using the expression "flashing butter" or the withdrawal of the classic trade bubble.
A quality plate should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus shall often make such decisions under pressure from one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the claims of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher-quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and not be able to present "abnormal curves".
The European Commission has defended itself by saying that this seeks only to harmonise national non-harmonised standards to date, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules that refer to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis of the fact that the existing directive entails a waste of food.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU requirement last year that in the inflamed globes marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years of age are not allowed to inflam them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, globes are the main cause of infant death by asphyxiation.
A similar restriction applies to the use of rabbits by children up to 14 years of age.
Interesting events are even born in our country
Also absurd is the regulation on European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. In order not to hurt Greece's sensitivity, it is necessary to talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, appointed in the survey, among some of the absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume established for preserved silk, which was threatened by a substantial fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in paying those countries that did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application of subsidies.
This kind of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are in disfavor for having no sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation," the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) said in autumn 2004.
He argued with the fact that there was a lot of grain in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was prepared to assist the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Niemec (US-DEU).
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often clear criticisms, EU regulatory efforts and also more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but that Member States have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fiber, as are other countries in the Union, by the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these wars.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc requisition, but they had to change their name to the national ron, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and it turned out to be "tuzemák".
Only products obtained from the distillation of sugar cane can be called ron, but not those made from sugar cane.
In the official list of EU protected designations of origin, along with the cheeses of feta and gorgonzola known worldwide, the mazapan of the German city Lübeck or the ham of Parma, for example, are already the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the carp de Pohorëlice and Treboň and, even, the variety of lupus of Žatec.
As protected maras from the EU, they may be proud of the ginger bread of Pardubice and the gorillas of Hořice v Podkkonosí.
People want to save the republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura
Mr. Senator, how did you get to present yourself to the election for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't be presenting my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how it has been stolen in the last 20 years in our country, how thieves are being punished, taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to give a solution to change it.
And since I am now forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon thereafter it has been headed for the presidency.
Aren't you giving the back to those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy to the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later, I needed to say that if a senator was elected, he would present my candidacy to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticise at the bar or in front of the television, but that we hit anyone who wants to start a change.
This is added to the media, which debase you and confuse your freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said of me that I have subjugated journalists what I have been the advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
The presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibility of politicians and the declaration of ownership of more than twenty million is presented.
That's why you have to change the law.
As President, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group so that the leadership office can be recognized as an autonomous work, and we have succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, either from the right or from the left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without scissors or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is it a man of the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more than left.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we get out of here.
I don't care if someone's right or left, I want to join people.
Always open support for any good solution, whether the proposal comes from the KSCM or the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.
He's joking when he says you're a populist.
But aren't you proving what you're saying?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get closer to them.
There will be some who call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about already work in the world or known experts are talking about them.
However, without the support of Parliament, it is reserved.
And this cannot survive long-term policy.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have another choice.
Convinced politicians, journalists and civil society and tried to put them on my side to achieve it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live broadcast on television in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character that points to disputes, pressure can be made on the political scene.
We take the direct election of the President, who has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I say I'm just a fan, I'm not either a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I'm trying to find allies.
I have just started politics and try to get as much support as possible for my programme.
I try to get things going myself, but if it doesn't work out well, within six years I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not doing anything with a person, so I've visited a number of well-known personalities, because they're best encouraged to submit their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Janchura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I have supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought out the fraud with light heating oils.
I presented myself on the basis that people are really unhappy, now I'm on the balance.
Sixty per cent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did so voted in favour of the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are two from the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I have not yet considered it because I do not have time for it, to check the untenable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I don't have any money for the presidency campaign, and in my transparent account, there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
He's talking about property statements, how's yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague, I have an estimated 25 million land, a rated 10 million land, another raised land in eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Superb Shkoda valued in one million, and I have a couple of millions in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was brave with women and, at the same time, was fighting evil and injustice.
Drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your part.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that there is no sponsor shows that there is no interest in my programme.
And I don't have to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The costs of the campaign cover essentially what I will receive in terms of Senator's salary.
But I couldn't live with it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't introduce myself as a candidate.
So will he continue his business activity so that he can live?
Didn't you say you were going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a bigger salary.
As I have promised, in part I have left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my spring replacement.
People would like him to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How much do you usually win monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I still win.
If I were a president, then I'd leave the business.

The study of architecture MVRDV shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkennie library and the recently completed "book collection" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and finally there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby who goes through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company near the library, points out: "Also, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and electronic books.
Nobody likes to go into those old fashion libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping city located at the gates of Rotterdam that only deserves a fugitive visit, boasts the dubious honor of having stood up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to somehow contribute to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of decorated gold mines.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was as the political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture study MVRDV, all a teacher in the art of bar charts and responsible for fun and cynic buildings, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile in his face.
And as the jury looked around and held his shoulders, Maas began grasping the books by size by forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, called 'Boekenberg'".
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain rises in the expected place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with a underground parking, a supermarket, a mail office and a couple of residential and residential buildings.
At the beginning of November, the book mountain was won with the second "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town with no history, which so far had nothing but to offer that a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town after whose white facade one would rather have a central milkhouse, now has a contemporary architecture work.
But above all, Spijkennie now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to the Book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a queser.
It is true that there is an elevator that carries us right into the center of this mountainy mass, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but rather they prefer to merge with their topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully crystalled interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the piled brick floor and the elegant light bulbs undoubtedly support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
By raising the view you can get to view the park's banks, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally bookshops are available throughout the facade and in the center there is a huge dark room that is usually something uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is put our legs on the classic space configuration and take out the reading area from the inside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black stands that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and rocking it at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the architects and civil engineers more a day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We would like to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And this is how one day, in a Frisian agricultural holding, we meet with the appropriate by-product from agriculture.
Since many years ago, a plastic fabric of few millimetres thick has been used in winters and in the Netherlands as a basis for subjecting the roots of crops.
This is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library, this fabric was taken for the first time in such quantities up to reach plates of four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells a new car mix and sports shoes.
After 105 peldas it reaches the top of the mountain.
At the end of this route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafe there is not only a fantastic view of the city, but also in it you can enjoy some delicious Dutch croquets and its figus planted in huge pets.
These create a pleasant atmosphere for the pair that maintains the adequate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
"Although it costs believing it given its large crystallined surfaces, this building is an exemplary project with regard to ecology," Trouborst points out.
The required heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge pyramid of crystal, even in the sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden circles across the glass facade serve to give shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to put his foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Also, Chinese traditional medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She describes the "Boekenberg" as the "dark soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, due to the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, everyone in the city was invited to give a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill in, at the moment, the optical gaps of a library that still does not have its full file; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has been silent for a while.
The barns are full.
"There is nothing worse than an empty medium library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative, all inhabitants now have a certain connection with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Though he's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved all success in that royal discipline that in the specialized argot is known as "the creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of the young man and indiscreet what he can be.
Finally a starting point to conform to your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather pelagic diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany indicated that it would vote against the proposal to grant the observer status of the United Nations to the Palestinian territories.
However, Berlin finally gave up.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also refrained from establishing a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is due to the fact that it is currently reorienting its foreign policy, away from a leading policy, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what is even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Thus, the Germans are in a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think you're still trying to figure out what your role will be, but they've already started the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to that of countries such as France or Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a policy which, when it comes to national interests, shows a willingness to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position adopted with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the vote of the United Nations?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason it must be careful and not alienate from the Arab public opinion or from the Arab elite.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give you that much importance, since it is not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a key role in the German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by abstaining from voting in important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a huge degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic break-up as in Libya.
Perhaps that is why Germany has managed to cultivate a certain respect.
After all, all this has not been done but demonstrated that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the other hand, the United States has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of views between the United States and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of US internal policy.
I believe that the Obama government shows a great deal of understanding to the European position in secret.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I think that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the magnitude that is attributed to it.
If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not excited about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the opportunity to be part of a superior body, but they must push things out of their own position.
That is exactly what they are now doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will assume a leadership role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, it is simply because of the relationship it has with Israel.
This has always been a pelagic issue.
But I think that the Germans clearly have to play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or maybe it's still hard for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still costing a more important role.
If we observe the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany puts itself as the main actor, certain anti-German feelings are taken away.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
In view of this, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the United States on European policy is falling increasingly, but the EU does not currently cover that void, who is left?
The Germans will have no more remedy than to assume a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if it makes them uncomfortable or if it makes them even more unpopular people, it's life!

"Mark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-famous brand and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name a name is hidden officially registered in China but it has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, this enjoys protection while the true eponyms do not make a claim.
And even then it's not clear that you're going to give them reason.
"For foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer for the Taylor Wessing buffet specializing in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
The simulators simply add a few letters to be able to record their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada it registers Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of sports articles Puma.
Pattloch opens an archiver in which he holds seats from the Beijing brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company asked to register the brand Zigna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zigna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different. Because of its customers, he fights against the fact that the brand office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying mark.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to the business, we have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage the image suffers is huge."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year China is, in size, the third market for luxury goods and growing at a higher rate.
However, the cancellation of registrations of suspicious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also entails a lot of money.
The processes can be extended to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had been so long that the subject name of the claim had already become a "market reality".
"If the claimant is in poor luck, he may even have to pay money to the complainant because the process has damaged his brand in China," Pattloch points out.
Sometimes this is the law of the forest.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a fight against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that was absorbed recently by the German manufacturer of Putzmeister concrete bombs.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use a very similar emblem to the star of Mercedes.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that remembered BMW very much; the case was referred to the courts and Geely had to modify it.
Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against copyrs from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the direction opposite the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the situation of the labour emergency has returned to normal".
In this way, the number of untreated claims processes has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, more than 75% than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China will lead the list of new inscriptions worldwide for a decade, as indicated by the brand office.
This also seems to happen with the number of valid logos, which amount to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1,800 million yuan would have been paid in respect of rights.
In other words, this means that on average each entry costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euro.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in the courts against a Chinese copycat.
Although the Germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the simulator has managed to ensure Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have provoked this situation because in Germany the names are not protected," Hanno Wenzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also dismissed the use of munitions.
In both of the following instances, Freudenberg was given reason, but the opposite is still fighting at present.
We need to be very careful
The case has now reached the gates of the Supreme Court of Justice, where a resolution remains pending.
Wenzler is confident that he will be able to resolve the matter in a favourable manner and welcomes the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review records of up to 100 years of age in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "sum of six euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but failed.
"This shows how much we care," Wenzler points out.
The dangers encountered in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
specifically if copyrs are guaranteed rights on unprotected marks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
Long ago, the group left this commercial area, but managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wenzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what is to be done is to "register everything that can be protected in China as Wenzler points out.
On the contrary, the topic can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last attack on his private battle, then he would have to pay the opposite party license rights for his own name, as Wenzler explains.
That or the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dance, Sing, Help
In Heidelberg he tries the Imbongi chorus and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The history of a bond capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, taco shoes and mocasines seek the compass on the parquet floor, and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers begin to rise slowly (contraryly, low, tenor and soprano), shaking, stuttering and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his boxes by trying to sort out his energetic and soft gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music room of Heidelberg's Institute of Medical Psychology the choir Imbongi is trying a new song.
The fifty singers, from 23 to 69 years of age, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the householder.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a foreign language only known: the Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for Self-Help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS Programme is estimated to have around 34 million people worldwide infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already seropositive.
The Voices for Africa association has found patrons in Germany for the 180 orphans of the village of Esitje.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, a child can be rounded up.
This contribution will cover the school record, uniform and ensure you have a hot meal every day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "story storyteller" or "panegirist."
In this room no one can speak fluently this buntu language, but singing does know.
For ten years this choir has been testing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the Suaziland kingdom, there is a village called Esiteni, which depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty per cent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw, a large part of them are children.
Over 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitje is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the people in Swaziland are immunodeficiency virus carriers, and dying with something over thirty years has become something common.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this resonant population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but mainly food, clothing and training.
Without a school title, the possibilities in a poor country are more than few.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few which made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally occupied by AIDS orphans in Esiteni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among bacterial-origin TSIs are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral TSIs are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Ladillas and sarna are located among the parasite-transmitted TSIs.
What are the main groups of affected persons?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of every five syphilis cases registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are colloquial infections, tricomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hongo) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, about 20 per cent of the new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, Chilidia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has remained a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were reported.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urinary discomfort, flow, abdominal pain, as well as ampoules or vertebrates.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and are therefore not detected.
How can you protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of contamination, but do not offer protection to 100 per cent.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if they change frequently from sex to sex.
If early diagnosis is performed, most ETS can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their actions in all of Germany are getting a lot of money.
"We have already sent some 200,000 euros in total to Esitje," proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman herself and with leadership gifts manages the money sent from Germany.
It ensures that orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandparents.
The "gogos", as called the older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their charge, offer them a roof where to live and make sure that children come to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who do not have anyone remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, has built two hens and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has managed that many of the people of the village have been tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the patent that this disease is all over the country, it is not usually open to talk about it.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and full lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unaccepted form of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that has experienced the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless times that travel the country from one side to the other and that they take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "on any corner you can get free condoms, but these are only used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin contact against skin."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years south of Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost end of the African continent still remember the era of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings you an excellent environment and a lot of joy, but has also managed to start a couple of tears to someone other angry border soldier.
The journey always takes them to Esiteni, where the singers visit the aparthed children.
Although this small population only appears on the maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is very well known.
"Assisting of Esitje, there shines the light," the people of the place say.
And after going through the 8,733 kilometers online straight back to Heidelberg to the testing rooms of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercury
The Messenger survey has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Probably the ice layer has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the North American Space Agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Although it is the nearest planet to the sun, there is also cold water, as it is revealed from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shade.
It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water is probably derived from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that in their day shocked against Mercury.
Nobody connects the finding of ice with the possibility that life exists on the planet, says the head researcher of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, findings could help clarify how water and other life components have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Completely unwarranted for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that form our solar system, in addition to the planet enamo Ceres.
Like Pluto, which rotates around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue points, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This region of star formation, called in a little romantic way by the W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This revolving image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifida Nebula, 5,400 years of light from the Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture of the Galactic Star Training Zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object in the night sky.
However, the telescope can better appreciate the colors.
The Nebula of Helica appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 years in light of the constellation of Aquario.
Its similarity to an earthly continent has been validated by North America's nickname.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a colorful spectacle.
This star in the ashes could be captured throughout its splendour for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great incognites of astronomy.
It is probably a remnant of one of Saturn's months that disappeared without leaving track 4,500 million years ago.
One of the largest and most refined photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Remolino Galaxy.
Depending on the hues, some images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The image published by the Southern European Observatory shows the Trifida Nebula located several thousand light years in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), as dark dust lines divide the bright heart of this star formation area into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: at 400 million light years from Earth, the nucleus of two galaxies in fusion process is balanced towards each other to end irreparably shocking.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it with the name of the Southern Molinillo.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cefeo.
The nebula at 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiographs made by different telescopes.
Shows a ring of black holes located at 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the spiral galaxy of larger size UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the group of brighter young stars of our Milky Way.
This star formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rose Nebula, there are also continually new stars; at 5,000 years of light from the Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there's no dust yet, just gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe could be found above all hydrogen.
Our Universe Window: the Most Important Telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have increasingly depth.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Telescope Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of this most economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a relatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is equivalent to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope, researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Extra-terrestrial Intelligence Search" (SETI for its English stamps) can help anyone who has a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here comes the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take images.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of 30 meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hands of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 he has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planetary candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations for the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched into space on board an Ariane rocket 5 until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers are based on the fact that there is also ice in the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no evidence that the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in a much closer orbit to the North Pole.
From decades ago, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger 2004 survey, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty that it is.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years

To the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach Bible age.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The journey through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great streptio through the sinuous road that passes beside forest hills, rivers of great caudal and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, you might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here the "talyshi" live, a people who don't know much, apart from perfectly mastering Persian and Azerbaijani and who are very far away.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city assumes an architecture perhaps too massive designed in the Soviet era and does not seem to fit at all in such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists only reach this place, since the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
It takes eight hours to cross the 323 kilometers that separate both urban cores because the road is one way.
The amazing wealth of which the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what is needed to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May because of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the Older People of the World," Fatulayeva says.
This is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here it is documented the life of eight dozen thalyshis of the place that have been over 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points out an image in white and black.
This is my grandfather, who lived for 120 years.
One of her children died at the age of 136
However, the undisputable star of the museum is the shepherd of sheep Şarali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we take into account that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973", Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married on three occasions and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive a daughter at the age of 136.
Has Şárali Müslümov been wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "including in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; maximum when there is no civil registration.
Every day bottles filled with powdered butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a Bible age.
Currently there are 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do they live here, in the south, so many older people?
The tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the Thalysians.
The museum director, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the foods rich in the calories of the talyshi, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of which, in addition, drink daily a bottle of melted butter, be so healthy.
Or maybe it's the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At its 97 years of age, it is relatively young for what is styled by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it moves incessantly a huge butter cloth.
Eight people live under a roof, among them one of the sons and one of Mirzayeva's daughters, both became grandparents long ago.
They also play on the other side of two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that serves in typical glass in an abrasive way.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the armpit hides two long pieces of dark brown hair that your son finds proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, which is why I've never fallen and kept my color.
"I've never used a shampoo," Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced in his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and guisantes.
In my entire life, I've never gone shopping for a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the postwar period after World War II.
However, everything came back to its senses when the "beloved father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of a larger woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the worship practiced on the fatherly figure of the nation, which ruled its country as a dictator, does not know limits.
It remained in power until 2003, the moment the witness handed over to his son Ilham.
At least the older people in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) in terms of monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And maybe Mirzayeva's son-in-law is right: "In our culture the older ones are very respected."
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to live for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo show the tremendous division in which the country is immersed.
The future constitution, with the Sharia as the basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spy on patriotism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially to the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the illustrated Muslims and the secular ones.
All of them, without remedy so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand its "to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate degree awarded by the University of South California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
Indeed, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by an assembly consisting of 100 predominantly Islamic members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
What, though, does that mean by "principles"?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it appears that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal manoeuvre that has appeared, to impose a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
This is at least what suggests a new article added: in all questions relating to Sharia, it is compulsory to consult the University of Al-Ashar, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islamism.
It has no reason to do so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the inability of the judiciary.
Much of the draft of the constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that he intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship, these courts served to impose a severe repression on the opposition.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As established by the drafter, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morals and values".
It is such an inaccurate formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Speaking clearly, it's nothing but censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, it is forbidden to offend or slander the Prophet Mohammed and his descendants.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it must be punished.
Equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits the "offensive to people"
Is it enough for the president's caricature or a joke about a letter?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for submission to the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
Weeks ago the opposition was closing ranks against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at Tahrir del Cairo Square and swore to make the Act fail before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has come back and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who holds third place in the lists for the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and Former Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft of the constitution should be "in the cube of the trash of history".
Through Twitter he accused Mursi followers of wanting to lead a "state coup against democracy".
"When I convene the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," says opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been exonerated," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-monstration; if not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, in front of the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in the same cry: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Mursi to "clean the country" at the same time as they proclaimed: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi's supporters did not want to risk such a thing.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who opposed the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views high and clear.
Now would have been the time to let the people decide in the urns which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamist eraser has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," laments a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Mursi's powers to the three powers of the State led to the resignation of this lawyer.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it," says Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which sees the ideological struggle taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protestor at Tahrir Square warns: "You are designing a monster that you will not be able to control."
The Norwegian raffisk: is the world's most unfavourable fish?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards, not just Europe but the world.
Is it possible that the country's success will preserve any relationship with its greed for a very ill-fated fish?
Take a series of excessively curated cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a dirty and wet football mountain.
Leave it there for a week.
Then you can smell the paralysing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway’s exquisites.
I meet in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowed. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The raffisk is made of salad that is allowed to ferment in water during, depending on the malady you prefer, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival that is held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this food most, so to speak, captivator.
"Be cruel and then drink a glass of aquavit from a trago," says Havard Halvarsen, a city bomber who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
On the other hand, we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from an important drink.
"Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," says Havard.
Drink can kill the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it close to your nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a lot of sushi that's traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Racfisk is a product from a very different time, in which poverty was being bottled up in Norway and in which, before cooling, the fish was kept during the fall in water and salt in hermetical barrels.
Later, in full winter, when it is already well fermented, it is extracted and, obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and they emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of residents of Sweden, the old rival and even makes not much more rich than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Racfisk is considered something important, an essential part, although rather ill-fated, of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. One can of beer or a sandwich cost you the 10€ ($14) fridge each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of the international news and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still not ready to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of July 22".
The Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's current wealth there is growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our comrade, as she goes through raffisk flags and that, with her long red apple and her surprising blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
Your English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like snooping, we don't like snooping."
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money that he did not have during the years that preceded the financial crisis all over the world, Norway kept the ticket well closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and make hiking in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat raffisk," he adds with a loaded development.
I'm in the snow doing the glue to eat something; I've already had enough raffisk.
Now a high hamburger is undoubtedly something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, he becomes that sickly fish.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where a raffisk dinner is held in which the commissaries vote the best fish, or perhaps the one most testing the nasal holes.
A TV has been online with a presenter who wears pajarit and is surrounded by raffisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision competition.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There are laughs and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquivit.
Or maybe the steams of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take over his office, the BBC correspondent Will Grant, analyzes the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested by itself, a steel circle has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from getting to their place of work, but to prevent protesters from getting to Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the nation's management.
Faced with a complicated task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is in a war against drug trafficking that has been charged some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment with the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, at the Oval Office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal."
Before he co-ordinated with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very populous state with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Opinions on the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of growing tourism on the site and building infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive along one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which means a huge improvement compared to the paved roads and plenty of bays that were rehabilitated.
You can also see signs with their name at the entrance of a modern multi-sport and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change," says his political friend Gabriel Olvera Hernández, MP of the party of Mr Peña Nieto, PRI.
"Partly, in terms of security and economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was released by Vicente Fox in 2000.
MEP Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the qualification that the opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere, very committed man with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic state man and, above all, he's a person who can hear."
However, on the other hand, that state is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the City of Neza, the contrast with the well-known streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway structures is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also tough and urban.
At the beginning of this year, military intervention was requested to help combat drug gangs operating in the neighbourhood and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in only the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Juárez City, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto said, in the best case, that I could not address the problem of femininity while in charge.
The most critical accuses their administration of making a fat view.
In a hormonal house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I came to her house, it seemed as if her body had been cleaned," recalls Mrs. Goodness.
"There were signs that he had been beaten and the strict mortis had already appeared."
While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana observes from the walls, along with a cross in which a single word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says it has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if it were an old chismus, an abbot, a cheese.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shuts up."
"But that can't be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico for the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope it's the same kind of president he was when he was governor," says PRI Olvera MP in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of the city of Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't report bad treatment, as prosecutors say.
Prosecutors try to deal with Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse during his stay in prison
The trial focuses on Manning's period in Quantico's military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest filtration of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while under military arrest.
During the interrogation conducted by the prosecutor to Manning in a pre-trial trial in Ft. Meade, Maryland, prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein said that the records of the weekly visits of officers of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a view taken as a result of the defence's request to dismiss the case since its imprisonment had been hard and that it had already suffered enough punishment, arrived one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while he was detained.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while in service in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning is the source of information.
In view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest in Quantico military prison, where he was in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officials would have asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the celerators as "excellent" and the treatment received in the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although officers asked Manning directly about the treatment she was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some of the issues and that the officers who had visited him had talked about those issues and had indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they had not left a record of those issues.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after having talked about the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why he had not reported the treatment he had received during the January 2011 meeting with a council to examine the intention of suicide that he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get the reduction of the "prevention of injuries" regime under which he was under.
The military said that it had been placed under that restrictive regime, which was below the control of possible suicide, in order to ensure its protection and security to others.
"I wanted the major state to know that I was okay and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... in order to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he had lost his knowledge because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arajon, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning said that after moving to Quantico, most of the days were spent in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a pencil, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since he was forbidden to sleep or even to drown during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming out pointing his eyes while he slept.
He said that if the waiters couldn't see his face when he was back at night, they would wake him up to go back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal claim on Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about a claim he had made in the statement on Thursday, according to which, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning account to remain naked in front of the cells and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the account.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said that he was deduced by the order given to him by the cellist who was supposed to let the blanket fall with which he could have been covered, but he admitted that no one had ordered him to let it fall.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he could have used the elastics of his inner clothing or his ankles to self-esteem but didn't.
Manning testified that that night they had removed their inner clothes, their ankles and their glasses from their cell.
His lawyers had the hope that the judge would take into account at least the experiences he had experienced during his stay in prison and drastically reduced his sentence if he had been convicted in the war council, which was expected to begin at the beginning of the next year.
The defence stated that it intended to make Manning guilty of minor crimes and to defend other charges considered too extreme.
The view is expected to resume this weekend and it is expected that prosecutors will argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules of application to any detainee who is under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally triggering the publication of information on the Internet, filtration of information on national defence and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face eternal chains.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
Says that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; they say they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette notes that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had only dropped by the exploding and arriving in the immigration treatment area and was already completely confused.
Some posters indicated the way to two tails: one for "Mexicons" and the other for "foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I was supposed to go.
Since I grew up in Central California, my whole life has been called "Mexicon".
It is ethnic tachography, just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as "Irish" or my New York friends as "Italian" themselves.
Later I decided to "Mexicon-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, the tachograph or script was not necessary.
It was simply American.
I speak Spanish, as well as to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the line of strangers.
I thought at that time this week when the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
In the agenda of the day, as whenever the leaders of these two countries met, there was immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also wishing to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is so likely at this time that a Mexican stays in Mexico as it adventures to go to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in the European Union style in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue to fight drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remembered that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender half of their territory to gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements they remember are everywhere.
So, at a time when a U.S. official says anything that brings the least criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and between the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Moctzuma are at war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a whole challenge is that of more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason why there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our genealogical tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or some of the grandparents, to whom the door of opportunities was closed in Mexico and had to go north.
And most of the time that person fits into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of study, from a poor people, etc.
We are his descendants and we are loyal.
Mexico doesn't.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living in is that, the American dream, not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many Mexicans belong to the elite of the leading class do not like them.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulder as if we were out of a lower category that is not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their way of seeing, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still like lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this rock between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first ones know more solidly who they are and the second is bothering them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-American people I know feel they're not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstein.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we see ourselves as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I've learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised Mexican ambassadors, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and press the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And with the inequality of wages, gallant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be alone with this idea, my friends.
That's right.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still reluctant about how they treated their families a lot less time ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, New Middle East
The high fire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood flow that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and ordinary discussions about whom he started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to trash; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and for the first time missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be trapped in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything to them whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional alboroto.
Maybe this will make your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their lethal dead-point situation could be resolved.
A War That Is Not Lost or Winned
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the fire agreed on 21 November is maintained, this week's clashes have strengthened the halkons of both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good palace.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the poorest and most populous corners of the world, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its implacable rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time is playing for them.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a renewable regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar has also done so, one of the richest and dynamic states of the Gulf.
The proud members of Hamas say that the mid-Islamic month is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbula militia party dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamic trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Above all in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of Muslim brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the layman who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are the cousins of Hamas and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist to which neither Israel nor the United States can be excluded.
Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, Hamas has been placed on his site.
The Israel Iron Cup anti-missile system has proved its effectiveness and many of Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more quietly... for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for having started the last wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, in part thanks to the barrier that runs across the West Bank, the main piece of a territory that aspires to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite being illegal under international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even tougher group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why am I staring at these retorted Palestinians giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they shoot rockets like they did their compatriots in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their head.
The harsh wing may be imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere have little regard for Israel, their priority will be to address domestic difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Initiating a war with the superpowers of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire high is a good wish and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is to create a dust that will one day operate in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics is worsening the situation as the Arab population increases.
The gruesome missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic salary.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one that preaches sensible people from both sides, most of the outside world and this journal: two states and Israel's assignment for security reasons.
The short-term hope is that the high fire gives a little more impetus to foreign people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to stop the entry of weapons into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a category of virtual state in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first mandate, he failed to submit his own plan for peace.
Once again in the White House, it seems as if it is reluctant to give your attention to him.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
General Tobacco Packaging Act enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light on boxes of a green inactive color, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, enters into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands by a wrapper of an olive green extinguisher, a frightening image of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and babies sick of being children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the various health images and warnings, the only difference between boxes, mandatory from Saturday, are the names of the brands, all printed in a small font type.
This is the most stringent regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia states that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the features that make this habit glamour.
It trusts studies that demonstrate that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99 per cent of the chances that he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has put an enormous pressure on the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more affordable.
"The legislation will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the quantity of tobacco brought by falsifiers from China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Other people say that their business has benefited since the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone pickers and covers to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had been shot almost two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal to law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to majorist establishments and was waiting for more stocks.
"It's a good business for us."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the population sector to which the plan is directed.
After a number of Australian laws banning advertising on television and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to see cigarettes, tobacco marketing has become online.
Australia has banned online advertising to local companies and websites, but it cannot be restricted to foreign sites.
"If you trade tobacco and only keep this small window to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in reviews on brands from "foot citizens" published on social media sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It is worth asking if it's just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
The British American Tobacco in Australia indicated that industry focuses more on what involves the new legislation than marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to reject the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unduly restricted, although none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
It is likely that the WTO will issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, more stringent legislation is being considered.
In Australia many smokers prove challenging.
"Photos don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Excremely, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, says that uniform boxes make it more complicated for him to put them in the barns.
"It usually took an hour to unwind a delivery; now it takes four," says Yu.
"The government should have completely banned tobacco and then, it's, well, we're done and we're closing the store," he says as he raises his hands up.
In a world that is constantly connected, it's not so bad to get bored a little bit
During this year's Thanksgiving parties, I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane on which we were flying suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to them.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.
But there are more academics and child development experts who commend the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it is good that, both we and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Boring requires the brain to look for interesting options and may promote creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we accept boredom with good courage?
Yeah.
And not.
But we'll talk about it later.
Firstly, like many people, it was assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, says, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The Borrity, an animated story") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, it is not so.
"In fact, the story of boredom is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompey there are graffiti in Latin about the boredom dating from the first century C.E.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the research published and raising the idea of a discussion group consisting of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desiring, but unable, to participate in an activity that fills you".
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
Note that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, says, is "the change in the care process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time is passing slowly".
Boring can sound awfully like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed feel that the problem has them.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have problems concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in September of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups heard in the living room a television program at any volume that had no connection, others heard it with the low volume, so that it was only perceptible, while the third group did not hear the audio at any time.
The group that heard the program with the volume below showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, changing attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not to be bored."
"In fact, at present we know that moving or making scratches, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help to combat it, as they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and hold more information than those who are forced to remain silent," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what is boring at some point: the delay in a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
In order to help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale of trend towards boredom".
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that I'm interested that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, adolescents are a kind of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment involving 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He discovered that 32 percent of adolescents said that they would be bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said that they would be bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they would get bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if the current abortion rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he knew was that "adultness is a period in which boredom reaches its highest rates", largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, returning to my question of principle: Is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, from the point of view, we can expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling into the consumption of substances as a method of combating them, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way you have the brain to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you see TV, you may be satisfied in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So if your son is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to do so," says Professor Fenske.
And "that dosage capability applies to other situations," he said.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really wanted to praise boredom.
But neither should we be too critical of him.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable paragraphs of the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way of looking, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire that is too painful and worrying as to relate it to something that deserves the punishment," he says.
Note that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colored: no instruction book for the new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and football player in southeast Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe that he used to smoke.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends drove through Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by the police.
The police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a judicial citation for possession of drugs and related articles (small crimes involving each fine of $100) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," Orozco says.
And am I?
In the weeks following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of cases of lower drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor offences for possession of marijuana are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have stopped submitting charges against the 21-year-olds by small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the most conservative district prosecutors in Colorado have committed themselves to moving forward with cases open for possession of marijuana and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of recently authorized marijuana shops in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of Washington regulations are also turning the matter around.
They continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sale licences; all this before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or for bad, Colorado goes before most states with regard to the regulation of marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colored has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what might work.
"There is no real precedent that serves as a model," he says.
Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which two water flows, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide "adequate access" to authorised marijuana and its prohibition of doing cannabis business on a radio less than 300 metres away from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.
"In no place will it be more difficult to place an authorised cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson of the Centre for Legal Cannabis, a newly created research group.
On 21 November, Oates, the chief police officer of Aurora, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would cease to bring legal proceedings for minor misconduct for possession of marijuana to persons over 21 years of age and that the police would cease to file charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for carrying out the city's rules governing marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In the county of Weld, North Colorado, the district prosecutor, Ken Buck, represents a more stringent view.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those offences that were committed at the time they occurred," said Mr. Buck in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Junction police, the county's largest city, no longer cites adults for possession of small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, a county attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases of possession.
"I don't think you're wasting your time doing the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system was easy.
Contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambiance among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"It is a cultural barrier with the district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the accused of possession of marijuana and who is a local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the marijuana Act.
"It's been so long taking people to the courts that they can't really accept it as legal," he said.
As the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington were preparing to become test cases at the national level with regard to the legalization of drugs.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal frontier, they also look forward to receiving federal government information, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will resign.
Although some outstanding arrests have occurred for therapeutic purposes by patients and sellers of marijuana, the federal government has allowed most of its sales of marijuana to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"Although it is likely that anti-drug agents will not pull down the doors to confiscate a small drug bag, reactions will probably be shown to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted by the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an anti-drug policy exacerbator of Obama's administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it would take about a year before any of them could open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
"We do not want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious federal problem," explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted in favour of what the state voted in favour of."
Many questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "They accused me of being a Tory until I was fired from Oxford."
Don't attack college students for their views only now
I don't remember any time in my life that I haven't dreamed of getting a place at Oxford University.
My father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that promoted the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, in the two weeks of occupying my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to run the history career, I had already made the bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Standard The Evening Newspaper said that I had abandoned because I did not tolerate some college friends having sex in the room next door.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that I had gone because I was forced to drink in unscrupulous cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, not because I came from a private school.
They accused me of one reason, which in the corner of the so-called illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what's going on with that now.
Well, a number of reports indicate that a new generation of middle-right students is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of the conservative party students was such in Oxford that last week a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights as homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (group of graduate students) of the Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously, personally attacked and treated as thankless people" by their political ideas.
They want to create a post in the Equal Opportunities Committee of their university college to ensure that they can express their views freely.
Its situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wunderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" on students' politics and presented to the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed the postgraduate student Joe Cooke, former member of the Oxford University Conservatory Association (UCA), in a Rolls-Royce, lighting a silver suit and a silver stick.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "turk heads" by introducing higher registration rates.
Luke Black, 20 years old and vice-president of the Association of the Conservative Party of Nottingham University, said in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know us."
Samuel Roberts, 21-year-old and former student in Corpus Christi, who presented the motion for greater protection, said that this environment was "uneasy", while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old and elected president of the OOCA, said that the attitude of JCR members towards people who are at the right centre had worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members," he said.
During my first weeks in Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I entered the university in September 1986, and she was a very shy 18-year-old.
The hatred for the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honorous cause" after the cuts in the funding of Higher Education.
The environment would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students met and met the cathedrals, I received a sample of the bitterness I expected.
I found that not only did the cathedrals make a bold view of the ridicule of conservative university students but they were willing to participate in it.
The policy of the strike of miners, the privatisation and opposition of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came to the wooden rooms of the seminary.
The first to attend was to translate French texts from the 18th century into English, and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Señorita Wyatt," said cathedral Harry Pitt (dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
Not one of them.
Pitt, a man down with a face that looked like a bunch of biscuits, knew well how to drive bad biles.
"Are those thatcherists refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other university students laughed.
My eyes were burning with tears that I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy knowing people," Pitt said.
I went back to my room like a soul in distress.
That night I sat alone at the time of dinner at the university; then I felt a slight palm in the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who was introduced as a member of the UCA.
"I know who you are," he kindly said.
"I'm afraid that's how things are.
They're messing with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but you know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many Tories recently arrived to appear to be laborers."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardlyly dissimulate.
I insisted I didn't agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student from Philosophy, Politics and Economy who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I turned into the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sexual relations?" asked one.
"There's a palace given to each other, isn't it?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the Liberal Act of the 1960s.
Could I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would you see me forced to stay with people who thought like me just after nightfall?
Should I become a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years I expected were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
Tory's only open cathedral was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my university college.
They hated him for being not only the Conservative party, but also thatcher's advisor in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was just around there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because he adhered to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I started moving daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my most open family and friends of metropolitan mentality.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it is the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
I'd break my heart if you left it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had given up his faith.
The following week, during a seminar in which another cathedral in History had insinuated, speaking seriously, that I was a "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "stupid old people".
The trunk lasted a little while.
It was my father who put the last key in my college career's life in Oxford.
That's when my father wrote two columns a week in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked with a key.
I was in fear and, last five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you'll call me a weak crying.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to this level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, who has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party, but, today, is hiding behind a reputation worthy of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
Due to the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which has been opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the opening of "Valentino: Master of the Costura", a retrospective atheostic that brings together over 130 high-cost clothes created by his "maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colphon of a story whose only protagonist is "Mr. Garavani", but which could not have been written without its distinguished customers.
Valentino has always felt fascination with the rooted and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until the next 3 March, there are many private letters and photos with the signature of the most granite of aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through the Princess Marie-Cantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: of humble humility of the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to the icon of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with reality has nothing to do with it.
"At least they don't turn off their pickles on your magnificent carpet like they do some beautiful pop music celebrities," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and is generous and elegant.
"We all loved to be invited to his chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimately forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, lighting a Valentine
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charism of the modest.
Many years ago, after a show in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner on his floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, everything was seen and felt its spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the High Costure Week of Paris in 1995.
"Never goes out of fashion because your designs are art works," he said.
Alcurnia Show
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well matched love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to parade through the walkway to contemplate a "audit" of dream that shines in Valentine's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the dress that Monica Vitti used in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to the Farah Diba Empire.
In this public of manicures there are names such as that of Sybila de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sofia de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the modest in 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentine is like the first love, "unforgettable to forget."
I remember him perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a jacket "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he highlights our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors I use, have great light and are "donors" on my face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovapaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she saw a Valentine.
When he was a teenager and lived in Italy, he dreamed of coming to have the age and opportunity to wear one of his nightwear...
Finally, the time came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress, with winged tail, "corsage" flagged and heard a word of honor.
"It was a dream made real," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is temporary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her modest dress party with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories she wears".
The "king" of fashion
The great end of the exhibition by Somerset House is Marie-Cantal Miller's wedding dress with Paul from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the modest man called his jackets) to develop that marble silk suit with pearl incrusts, twelve different matching types and a row of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority in the specialized press, this dress represents a hit from the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Overhauled for years with the "savor-estre" of the elite, now Valentino is his best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rank distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Laboro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion de Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of its clients.
"He has always called me to mind his refinement, his calmness, his clean and perfect appearance," says D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was at the table of Count Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The world's toughest trade: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health by charging 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another who, literally, work in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking the sulphur out of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian Java island.
To this end, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphurous gas that flows from the Earth’s bowels is solidified by contact with the air.
After booting large asbestos rocks, which total up to about 70 kilos, they are carried in two bamboo baskets that carry on their shoulders through rocky cliffs.
It is only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the wearers' exhausts take more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle's step, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps to avoid rebalancing and falling through the precipitation.
They know that any bite could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who was dumped years ago because of the risks of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro per kilogram of sulphur they extract
Once up, there is a passage between tourists who photographed them as if they were monkeys of circuses and, tiredly carrying heavy canasts, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little below, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents euros) for each kilo of sulphur.
Then sell it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euros) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is generalized in everyday life and is used to manufacture cerles, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamite and even white sugar.
"As usual it is to load 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Ando, who usually performs three daily doors.
It takes three hours for each one to finish grinding, but it allows you to add 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would gain in the field.
"The miners' newspaper is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid at 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2) on the day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167)," explains the carrier, who previously worked as an Albanian in the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cup was not so hard, but then he returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, proved as overwhelming as the sulphur: "I married a young Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought it to Java to convert to Islam."
Then he has asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughs and his eyes get irritated by the toxic gases
At 27 years of age, then he plays three fighting in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pass his bill even though his face is covered with a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, he is constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this young and intelligent young could be a tourist guide, comrade or receptionist of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other carriers, she rises every day to the two in the morning because the sulfur doesn't stop driving at night, when her characteristic yellow color becomes blue and bright in the middle of the darkness.
Challenged the shadows, then went down to the crater lighting with a little flashlight attached to its helmet, which he himself bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its many benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or to provide any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and on both weight.
In fact, it is not even part of the 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.5) of recharge by camera that, along with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for animals and not for humans," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 kilos, ensures he will continue working "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children from 18 to 10 years of age.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and selects the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns coming out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of severe diseases... beyond that, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and joints in the shoulders, which have been damaged by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on your back, Unainik can already only load 50 kilos at its 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of sulphur into the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a path of goats between the lake.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainik, opening her mouth well, where she lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, his older, 30-year-old, he also worked on carrying asbestos.
Time passes, but the perpetuity of generation in generation is one of the world's toughest occupations: the making of the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore search for babies to save the economy
Singaporens blame the race, the stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we believe in life!
It may seem invertible that these verses are part of an advertisement of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a bowl (ball) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hosts the hope that with the ad they will get the attention of the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfil his "national duty".
This is something purely Internet, so we had to make it fun and fun.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to make up a rap?
1.2 children
What doesn't take it so lightly is Singapore's government.
It spends $1,300 a year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time I was over 2 - known as a replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporens have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage Policy and Family of the National Population Division, says it is due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities, beyond marrying and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to the delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration in order to address the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia abounds only in disguise against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping low wages and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem, with the highest contributions and contributions for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has been controlling the number of small apartments, known as the "box of shoes", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square meters and have had a lot of success in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a lifestyle of singleness and discourage developers who want to build large, family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that their "boxes of shoes" are sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units are exhausted, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
He admitted, however, that the new rules provided clearer guidelines for developers, who had previously been hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre seems to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are face-to-face, and education is also, so many people are postponing it," says an executive youth.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," another 20-year-old says.
Men and women mention their career, the stress and cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, for as long as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private off-line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, this is about the quality of private life or "the scope of private life which is entitled to protect from any intrusion".
What is private for a person under 16 years of age?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and in your social networks?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by ventilating on the Internet in situations that would certainly not be sharing off-line?
The Journal interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent network users.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "very mine", on the personal level, and "in the key and name of the user", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets wouldn't go up to a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I lift beautiful images or games.
I'm also entertaining my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that's not mine, or someone that's making the joke," he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscen pictures of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge makes sure to meet the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just pick them up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
I have no doubt that I would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to anyone who recommended a stranger.
Joseph's 14-year-old case is different.
The adolescent has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this latest admission not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has indicated to him or asked him for the address of his home or phone number.
"If they pressured me or demanded me just the bags of my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not foreign to the experience of what is today known as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was exorcising him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
"I never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
"Just put him in privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I'm wrong or if I'm hungry.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of looking for information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, Master of Education at Yale University and author of the Native and Digital Immigrants, came up with these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, children and young people born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He notes that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what it is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or say to an age that maturity does not give for that."
"Even if they're selective when what matters most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach what is privacy for children and adolescents is through questions that will make them reflect.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do that on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When tagging photos of parties, did you ask permission for other people to tag them?
And one more, do they all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to show them that they should act on line as they do off line.
They're the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," he says.
Watch
Esturado Guardia, a university cathedral, primary professor and educational consultant, notes that it is essential for family parents to be aware of the policies of social networks.
When they understand each of them, they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key for children to remember the lesson of "don't talk to strangers".
Finalize the Unasur Summit without making the Lima Declaration public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven Assistant Envoys.
Ef tried to access the document signed at the Sixth Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unashur, on several occasions, but sources of Chancellor and Presidency pointed out at the outset that it was to be delivered after the closure, but then stated that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief press statements.
The access of journalists to the information of the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day only, the unsound video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information he circulated among reporters was delivered by the press spokesmans from some of the Governments of the Unassur who attended the meeting, although not Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, causing the ill-fated hundreds of journalists from various national and international media that requested more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was Humala's statement, not the official document that closed the summit.
In last October, Peru was the host of the Third Summit of South American Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being urged by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration had not been disseminated.
The official website of ASPA can confirm that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities endeavoured to ensure secure transmission systems for all journalists but limited the availability of information to a maximum extent.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a case by the Hague Court to say a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they would respect the decision of the (CIJ), which began Monday in The Hague to listen to the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will execute and execute the sentence defining the differences that we are taking to this international court today," Humala said, together with her Chilean couple.
" Chile has been, is and will continue to be a respected country of international law, of the peaceful settlement of disputes, of treaties and of international courts," Piñera added, and greeted Humala, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ was then that Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the cases of that international court, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after the afternoon of Lima.
He read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and the lines of action had been established for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he said that the countries of UNASUR would take "significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residence".
He reported that actions are being pushed to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, Internet access at low prices in all parts of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters".
With a crisis Europe, "the economic consolidation (from Latin America) should not have a triumphalistic matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and brighten a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a reading message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the cross-roads of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to reintegrate it into the South American Union," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to maintain itself as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he was expecting to meet with his couple from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in a respectful manner the maritime difference after a IJC failure, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We're going to review all these paths, they're not exclusive, including the Nicaraguan treaty will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope I can tell you that we manage this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday where they intend to attend the leadership of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc's Defence Ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on Defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"Suramerica must learn from Europe to integrate citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "Suramerica, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union (Unasur), held in Lima, told the Peruvian state TV that Europeans "killed in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a country".
In this regard, it defended the project to establish South American citizenship that encourages the member countries of the United States.
"The free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also supported the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the pretext of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who had signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who give chair are never committed to anything and, instead, we South Americans have signed everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," said Julian Assange, in an allusion to Ecuador's political asylum to the founder of WikiLeaks.
Correa assured her that she was not repentant of that decision because she had not betrayed her principles but had respected her "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at the time, "there were fundamental suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and its process was not respected".
He also criticised the Swedish court for demanding that the interrogation be submitted to its territory for a alleged sexual offence when "Sweden legislation allows it to be carried out through videoconferencing, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa claimed that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health is deteriorating.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian envoy.
What there is is is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate because you are trapped in a small space without being able to exercise freely.
"It complicates the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to Assange's asylum since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the granting of a safe conduct allowing him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been discussions with London in search of a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant conversations.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a number of procedures in different European institutions," he said.
And he thought, "if Britain's tomorrow he's safe-conducting this is over."
And if Sweden, as it is perfectly allowed by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks him via Skype itself tomorrow ends this problem.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and argued that what she did not tolerate is "mediocrity, evil faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression".
"We are not the biggest enemies of freedom of the press, we are not the evil and perverse politicians, but the bad journalists according to profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, it was welcomed that these journalists "will no longer be the bankers and the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and it has advanced that if they are re-elected "it will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto in Paraguay at least until its next elections, arguing that the agency "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and rule of law-enforced golf" because in reality "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered the "perfectly relevant" desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua now the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the case of the Hague International Court of Justice, which benefited from Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
That is not the case for the moment.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
We need to process them widely to overcome them and move on.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the dispute by maritime limits that remain in the same court of Peru and Chile and believed that "it is right for Latin America to seek international forums if the two countries undertake to accept a hard case."
Referring to the opportunity presented as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive mandate, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa assured that if she loses the February 2013 commissions, she will withdraw from public life.
I have never been interested in staff, but in situations as unfair as that of Ecuador that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
Winning would be my last period in the presidency and we're out of public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that was expected to go through the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse into President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
The Head of State of Ecuador today participated in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the South American Union (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with positive AIDS.
"It was as if I had fallen a bomb," he said, remembering the time of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "more soft", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness and began to inform himself about it; with such effort that he had already celebrated his birthday 43.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV patients in the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided getting fired from him "because he brought a cut".
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, unaware of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "depleted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least in the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this point means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on a timely basis and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's head of HIV Unit Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after stating that this information was reviewed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of exposure to the immune system that patients present at the start of the diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users: from up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years, when reporting 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that whoever receives the diagnosis of HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms "as long as he is in control he can live without problems until 75 years of age", the interviewer explained.
To measure this progress, remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Although mortality has significantly decreased in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since AIDS.
In Jalisco alone 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths to May this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are you still dead?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had enough medicine the problem is that patients get very advanced because they do not know their infection status, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He said: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they are already presenting some opportunistic infection, what they need to do to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and therefore they have to offer mass detection tests to all people who require it."
In its proposal experts and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to the test to a particular laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite his short age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die now, I'd better get back three times a week," they say no to me.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take the medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I care for myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with MILLENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those today, within the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let's do the test, if they're at risk, who sooner know if they're positive HIV, it's better and if they already have the diagnosis, who learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, its message, summarizes the motto of battle in AIDS this year 2012.
Condons after the display
There are great gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapatio journalist who has taken over the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us hundreds of packages, and that's very good but it turns out that there are people who still don't have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, with anger and value judgements of social workers, school teachers, pharmacists and health personnel, to whom adolescents are not exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not only behind the indicators and these hundreds are found in public bathroom dispatches from sites that are frequented by young people.
It is not motivated by promiscuity.
It is not about paying them the chairs and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, when he asked if there would have been a condom in his administration.
"So it's not sexuality, it's best to approach condoms to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the contagions correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. Appeals Court a judgment that does not know the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a commercial contest in Mexico, the scenario sets a bad precedent for any national firm with branches in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures below the survival of Mexican firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical area, the expansion to the judgment issued on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bancarrotas court for the northern district of Texas leaves defenceless to Mexican firms in view of the possibility of decommissioning their properties elsewhere in Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to come to the United States Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
On the other hand, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the United States Breakdown Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are the commercial tender in Mexico.
The first point would involve noticing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
To that end, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law was created, as an arbitrator to the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that without the vote of the inter-company, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial tender the debts which the Vitro subsidiaries had with their matrices, the required majority would not have been able to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, the Vitro was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-company debts were dropped by the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth is, in addition, that the votes of the subsidiaries remain, in any case, the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States Courts, i.e. the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved much.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The data ignores the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, this guilt to Vitro of the difficult situation that he faced from 2008 on the basis of the serious economic crisis that he faced in the United States, taking the collections to the country.
Soon, the signature of the González Sada family will bring a review before the court itself of appeals for the vote to be taken, that is, the five judges, since they only voted three.
Failure to prosper will result in the appeal of Cerciarare requiring the review of the proceedings by a higher body, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court disclosed a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of friend curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the proceedings followed by Vitro under the Commercial Competitions Act, noting that the Court was committed to the agreements signed by both countries to incorporate it into Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band caramel: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General's Balance
Sleeped for several months the complaints put on the table by the Mexican Aviation Unions against the company's ex-wife, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Aeropilots Association has already found the bottle neck.
The court led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Values Commission accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneurship to extract from Bank IXE Trust F/589, on behalf of Mexican Aviation, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares by the Professional Administrator of Hotels.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
Search Dragon Mart
Assembled at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about a huge center for sale and distribution of products to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean in the country of the wall, with a calcium-based housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose the monumental thing that had torn away part of protected areas and raised the mother of all hideouts against the industry.
ACTA died
Reported by the government a request by the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Falsification Commercial Agreement, known for its English stamps as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter had already gone to the file.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility of considering it attacking freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The balance has been my life"
Trotamundos of the "Hetin" Hetin" Balloon Hetamundos Reyes was more than 60 years connected to the tablonic sport and, thanks to him, travelled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of the local basketball as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was involved in sports for more than 60 years, he was as a player of minor categories, a player of the National High Balloons, held and directed in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Baloncesto Federation.
"I put a lot of hats in the balcony through my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," recalled Reyes during a visit from First Hour to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Balance has been my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when making such assurance.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorials that denote his wide journey, thus testifying.
Bayamón in the Heart
Of all, those who are most excited about it are those who remember their walk through the Vacheros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old, acting as co-powered or held by franchising.
"They were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, either as a prisoner, co-op or as a leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I fired myself with one in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut in the BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had headed here and was at Alabama University (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a strong 6"7 player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the Mincy principle, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gaussie would help bring another one.
The Vaqueros and Gaussian champions enjoyed it, but already at the distance, because by 1988 it was already federal.
For that time I preferred to enjoy their executions and Mincy's performances on the National Team.
I remember when we won the United States for the first time during the 1989 pre- Olympics in Mexico.
Then came the World of 1990, where we arrived fourth and must have been bronze not to be for that Canadian arbitrator who made us repeat the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
Is this World Group of 1990 the best National Team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as he won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a hair to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to what we won bronze in the world.
This team not only repeated Mincy, Gaussian, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had "Toñito" Colon and James Carter young, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Preolimpic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruiter in place of the players suspended by the Mar del Plata Panamericano, we won gold against all the prognosis.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
Without a doubt, that was Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that without counting your route in the different leagues you played.
Who was the best borician leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young people, I like Leo Ariel's work very much.
What do you think is your biggest achievement in the federation?
Had been part of the most glorious National Team era between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What did you have to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, such as regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now, children travel and play too badly.
At least I see the fruit of Compulsory Certifications and Course for Leaders, Table Officers and Arbitrators.
That's what I'm happy about.
What are you doing now?
What I do is listen to music, watch videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who's always been with me.
Kills the actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, most known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he incarcerated a man of unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative business.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a producer house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in her beloved hometown of Dallas, again representing the iconic role she liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the century, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, said her publisher, Jeffrey Lane.
I brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, kind and talented, and I'll surprise him a lot.
"He was an original person and lived life to the full," said Gray in a communiqué.
Hagman was diagnosed with hepatic cirrhosis in 1992 and he recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and was subjected to a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In it he interpreted Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changed when he finds an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and led her to live with him in his home.
He was also the protagonist of two comedies who were short-lived, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included papers well received by the critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the charmingly hated J.R. that led Hagman to his maximum star.
The drama series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", thought to generate expectations about a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risked in betting houses.
It also helped to give the series a record of hearing at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a chapter in November 1980, an average of 41 million TV viewers tuned it and converted it to "Dallas" in the second most visible entertainment program in history, after the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s cousin, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened her with becoming a prostitute unless she was out of town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s stone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal you've lost.
Principal Victoria, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled Friday to Hagman as someone "great, inside and out of the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who have had the luck to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were transmitted a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already completed the recording of five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in process, the chain reported.
There was no statement by Warner or TNT immediately about how the Hagman lost series will handle.
Oriented by Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who stealed classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he married lawyer Ben Hagman in 1931.
He was lucky at the New York theatre stage in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he titled his memories "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought it would hurt someone or affect them in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After liver transplant he became a donor of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the frightened patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I gather with them when they come for their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, as "they don't fear, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but they'll be fine".
He was also an activist against the habit of smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an unresistable angel: The end of the "long returning account" of the Maya Calendar on 21 December, to which many people have been arrested as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what was expected of him in the next couple of months: Hurricane Cataclysm Sandy, a tax precipice that some have called "deburmagedon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theologians of the end of times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days old and counting, this has been a really good time.
And they remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vucker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with examples of real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, entitled "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option to give the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "necessary ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on Friday of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students any other option but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"He sat down in two hours," Restall said about his high-average student course, which he filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who were asking if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Haddonfield's Religion and Sociology at Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular, or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or of the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no interviewed student - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and in a way we disbelieved it," said Julie Zeglen, a last year student in Temple, 21 years old and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back to several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them by preaching the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"On the other hand, people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about some course about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, implying an exception to a higher authority.
We have a Pope's pardon.
Restall noted that over the years he had spoken of many days of final judgment, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately on the next date" or philosophy that on 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period of which the world will end.
Students and teachers are getting light on the date.
Several said they were thinking about going to parties "from the end of the world."
"Maybe I'll call some friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
