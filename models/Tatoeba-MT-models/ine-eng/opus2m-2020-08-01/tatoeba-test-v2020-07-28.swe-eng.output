I let my feelings obscure my judgment.
Tom took Mary's hand.
People are sitting on grass.
I heard a South American camper was eaten by an anakonda.

She's done too much work.
She's not sure.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never agree.
It's uncertain whether the letter ever came or not.
We haven't done anything.
You lost your pen.
You're gonna be in bed all day, aren't you?
Tom can't do that.
Tom yelled under the roof wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really going to do that?
Give this to Tom.

Did I forget something?
You're longer than me.
Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?

You should have liked it.
I've got some more.
I'm using the computer.

Kate's cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems exhausted.
He's not angry.
There's no doubt about who's going to be chosen.
He was hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read the story of ring trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.

One morning he saw a cute girl.
This tree is not even near being the highest in the juice.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up.

Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a couple of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should've done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy took the cat's dream.
How do you know?
I got a lot of soft beds.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of anyone?
I'd like to talk to Tom between four eyes.
He'll fall for the temptation.
Teven doesn't work.
I can explain.
She's acting like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I can do all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated rapidly.
What does that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but can you at least accept that there are people who have different opinions than you?
Tom dropped the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't imagine seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I'm going to land for my Internet addiction.
I never thought it would be so hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get down on the city.
It wasn't boring at all.
Can you freeze it down?
Tom flashed with the light.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Tom and Mary may not have done that. They all say they did.
There's no one here who's called that.
It's time to go.
All three men lied.
Come and sit down.
It has to work.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My engine saw's broken.
You think she's pretty, huh?
He lived a simple life.
This is going to take years.
I was wrong about the word.
I don't like this book.
A blackfish has ten arms.
She didn't come before two.
I am.
It was very good.
Come talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
I've never seen such a peaceful view before.

Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver's angry with the steering wheel to the right.
I'm on the wind.

Save it until later.
I'm glad I saw him.
The land does not live in the North Pole, but in Finland.
Didn't I just say that?
I told him to come back right away.

We don't need any assistance.
I have to live as I learn.
Tom's shy and lazy.
When does Tom need it?
I must be crazy, but I'm not stupid.
Tom knows you're here.
Tom's ringing the bell.
I think I'm staying.
I saved your life.
And what do we do now?
It wasn't me who cut Tom's hair.
I don't deserve to live.
I'm thirty years old.
Do I have to hurry?
That's what you wanted, isn't it?
We ate eggs.
Do you have them?
I can't really do it.

I'm used to drinking coffee without sugar.
Remember the poem to next week.

I saw Tom give up.
Where I go, I come.
Is that a serious question?
