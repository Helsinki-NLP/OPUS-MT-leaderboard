28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to hurt him, "At last it went up again with him."
The body found on Wednesday morning in Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigations are under way.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told the ABS sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Boston, had spent six months in his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
A speaker of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" over his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and our associates are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "the things went up for him at last."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a great heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook something to prepare us for dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swam with the electricity.
"With everything that's going on in the world, he was this unspoilt diamond that lights up every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD's note phone under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I will always be stuck in school leaves
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made this clear in an interview now unmistakably.
"I will always be stuck in drawers or get glued out of outside labels, which have mostly little to do with me and the reality."
"I myself do not wish to be always perfect and successful."
"Unfortunately, these things are rather sloppy to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
Mostly the actress spends her time at home, in front of the TV with a lacquered shower and Mexican food, it says in the magazine.
To the white glow she brings the question of the wish for children: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's game" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sport pyramid
His experiences on the horse are observable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a slight change with an exit to the beach.
For the 58-year-olds, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their celebration night, they hunted home in the fast galop to the feeding troughs.
A kilometer at this rate, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And that's how the career ended.
On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournaments - again close to horses.
He was able to drive with his family over the AlRV system, on a horse he did not even force himself for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and so was the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sport aid provided the man from home in a small gala with the Golden Sport Pyramid.
There's no lack of sympathy for the sportsman.
Bundesverdeitkreuz, Silveres Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen already meant it.
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the sport pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it will be given not only for sports success but also for social engagement".
For decades, Langer has been promoting adolescence.
And so he continued to pay the price of 25,000 euros.
With 15 more outstanding athletes, the double US master winner was included in the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the outstanding are the lightweight athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fighter Cornelius Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Meinhard Nehmer, Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Spring Rider Alwin Schockemöhl and the posthum of the Handballer Erhard Wonderlich.
Many of these athletes came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrative company moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize was attended.
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.
Clinton's and Trump's economic policy compared: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Trump.
On the other hand, the two US presidential candidates are also involved in tax and energy policy and in a matter of principle.
The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them relatively small in doubt and warns how the state of the economy can harm them - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
On the other hand, he would be quite different, apparently Trump.
He will withdraw regulations massively, and he will make himself for a wide-ranging tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, that it has unfavourable opportunities to open up and needs money to do so.
That's why taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
The need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost exactly the same.
The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are, for example, strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty refugees of the Republicans.
So there could be internal discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.
Trump wants to build coal plants and boost coal promotion in the United States.
It should also be possible in protected areas to announce the Paris Climate Protection Agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand the renewable energies through its investment programme and calls for: "A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It'll probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far from each other.
TPP, the transitional trade agreement, does not want both of them to sign.
At the same time, however, both of them do not want to isolate the United States from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.
They're supposed to be better paid, like Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hungry wage.
She wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be raised, then he says he must not be changed.
However, the major discussion of the coming months would be more likely to develop around the fiscal policy of the two camps.
On one side lies Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens of their efforts to boost growth.
His critics insist on him to make the budget deficit even bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.
Flight: "Every refugee woman has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost every day.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby, which is at least one year old.
One put her little son in her arm.
He looks with great eyes curiously into the room.
His mother is staring at the table.
Until she notices she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.
The scene is normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the district businessman of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance offers in Bavaria, and deals with, among other things, the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodation for isolated women and their children in Bavaria.
In January Condrobs set up the facility together with Pro Family and the Munich Women's Assistance.
It has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - nor as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not excessive to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences of sexual violence on her flight," Bahr says.
"Men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatened with torture or death or because their families send them as hope bearers to Europe," she says.
In women, there are other reasons for escape: "Many steal from secret because they don't see any other way out".
In their home, they have gained experience with sexual violence, forced labor, murder, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what she's doing.
It's on the run.
"For example, the trailer for a bottle of water requires sexual action, is not rare," says Bahr.
And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Whoever believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is wrong, he tells Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and abused badly.
This means that about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't trust to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big."
Since they often did not know how to help themselves, there is a need for more accommodation just for them, asks Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
The question is whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence, some answer with no.
There is, for example, no such thing in government housing.
Even in the wild, refugee women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government press spokesman.
In Oberbayern, sub- and central francs, there are some community-run floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodation only for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be placed apart from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."
"If the private sphere is lacking or men and women are brought together, it can - and will continue - come violence against women".
In particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is included in the study.
How much women feel about this need for protection, you can fight at the Andrang which is on the house in Munich.
"Since we have talked about it, we have a long waiting list," said Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Helping doctors strike: Demands for new work combat measures
Representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their trade union to approve new work combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to adopt more work-related measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that it had failed to address the concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government would remain "persistently calm" to problems leading to the rejection of the contract.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new treaty completely and has called for official renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today has made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work-related measures beginning in early September.
The disputes resulted in assistant doctors covering six times this year, the first total cases in the history of the NHS.
BMA's assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malavana withdrew after the election to reject the agreed terms recommended by the BMA.
He shared with BMA members during the meetings, which were still held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract should be beneficial and adopted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced.
Russia and Turkey: "A Alliance of Foreigners"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves up and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handle, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed narrow and he barely radiated heat, even for his lagging relationships.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke repeatedly of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have noticed as bad as ever.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to be the opposite.
But one of Putin's sustainable coolers showed that the head of state had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening words: the removal of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction to the time was angry.
Putin broke out and accused Ankara of falling behind Russia.
The sin was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Re-establishing the Vestreau will be difficult if not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months the state-controlled media launched a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Once it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.
The most serious was the accusations by leading officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He fought this very hard.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to win.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly at hand.
Erdogan needs in the first place all the friends he can get after he was removed from his office at a failed state strike last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shocked him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are re-entered.
They count on a late-sea turbulence to the Mediterranean.
This week, the state television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemost said as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes long here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the west because it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.
In addition, the continued role of the EU accession talks and Putin is to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relation to the West.
The Russian head of state in Ankara certainly won a bonus for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted strike.
This is well-known for Moscow's self-understanding, which itself has a profound fear of regime change.
The summit in this beautiful palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present one, as an analyst once described me, "alianz of external sides": two countries that are in violation of the West and feel badly treated and now unite.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played its role as a peace founder, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that, after almost three hours of discussion at the press conference, the two presidents said that they had not even addressed the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about her differences, while Putin decided to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for a complete disaster when the NATO member Turkey launched the Russian combat - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak again at least.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is intended to be reduced only to a back office role, according to the Bank’s head of management.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has been away since it had to be nearly collaborated and saved eight years ago.
At this time, brand strategies "RBS" have been used to protect other end-user financial markets.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Victory Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange rating will be changed to NatWest.
The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will be our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we are not pursuing global goals, but are pursuing local objectives.
Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work under these brands with the customers.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sport sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop into a brand bank, because how do we concentrate inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the chief board.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th predilection at Newmarket
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He put on predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches the milestone in the race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won Ghaiyar before, said, "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori captures the jubilee when he wins the victory on predilection
Two jockeys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby champions had 4,493 careers
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma has been fascinated by fans for years for this kind of sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already won 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and a big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already won almost 30 years in GB, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the suspension sign of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of major tournaments, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month prison, but he showed an impressive character strength to overcome his doubts and return to his best form.
And he hasn't been at the end for a long time - Dettori once said he wanted to continue in competitions until his 50th year of life.
Russia Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a part of Putin's closest trust.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In an opinion of the Kremlin, Putin said that without stating the reasons why Ivanov's dismissal had been ordered as president of the Russian presidential administration.
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin website it is said (in Russian) that he was later the chief of protocol and chief of staff of government staff.
He said to Putin about his appointment: "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the Government's most important task to support your activity as head of state in relation to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his posts and had recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince you?
This step has made Moscow a secret web site.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putins and works as he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff had resigned on his own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, only a few are convinced of this - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once called a potential president wants to lead the Russian environmental policy at once - was on the verge of great speculation.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that in early 2012, I asked you to trust these very complicated posts - you could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been president of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
He was former Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service as Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
As Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of office would have violated Putin's constitution.
But these posts were adopted by another close allies of Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat producers
Gibson was involved last month in a physical dispute at the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his announcement.
In the set there were artistic differences and a variety of opinions.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how the character of Gibsons from the series followed by a team of FBI agents is written out are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old who previously played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg was with him since the first staff of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have entered my whole heart blood for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there by the end of it, but that will not be possible anymore.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for for a series.
The planned radiation of the twelfth staff shall be placed on 28 September.
Puzzles for fish landing in a garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals that were excavated by a spring fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in hopes that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected with Fife
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry Crossing with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fife.
It is the first of four locks of the "cover bubbles", which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete as well as 46 wire lines.
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown made a visit today and was one of the first to go from country to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a huge activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
A total of almost 79% of the total decks are in place and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a concrete for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure is a major milestone in each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure is a future-oriented high and deep building.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection to the north tower deck in the expansion, we had to close the gap on the north side or the country side.
This was achieved by pulling the north port bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very intense activity.
Massive, since the route is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tonnes weigh and had to be pulled up by about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances on which the team is working were small - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in the Moelfre Bay: Three Men Have "Happy to Be Still in Life"
Three men have "happiness to be alive" after they were thrown by their fishing boat before England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck at 13:20 BST alarm on Friday, after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties swimming safely while their boat moved from its own strength.
"We saw how the boat turned around and presented us the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly the strong winds have already weighed the boat out of their reach until we leave it to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat without rescue.
They all came aboard the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who have been thrown into the water have been unharmed and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop, the boat broke out at the center of the boat from the person who controlled the boat.
Someone's been waiting for these men today.
Severely injured - man sets up on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, cut off the alcoholics the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she came into the apartment, he entered it twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the killer.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's dress, he called his mother.
She then alarmed his sister.
Together with her lifelong companion, the 45-year-olds wanted to calm down their brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her lifelong friend.
On the street they met the ex-lifelong companion of the man.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who's building cheap apartments in Braunschweig?
The SPD and Greens mean: investors will be much stronger in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that in the next few years, Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments?
The SPD proposes a "housing concept" for the next meeting of the Council.
But the dispute is programmed.
First of all, it is the question: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There's been a lack of regulation.
SPD Group President Christoph Bratmann said: "We agree with the Greens: Anyone who wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock.
However, Bratmann said: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such areas, but at least 20 per cent of the apartments as social apartments."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann says, "There is still no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.
The link still wants tough jobs for investors.
In spite of this, Bratmann said, there was an increase in the situation in the housing market.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide for additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear if we're going to get the specialists.
However, the programme is still not complete: because about 1260 new apartments should be built anyway.
How, though, does the loss of some 1300 other cheap apartments whose promotion will run out in the coming years equal the loss?
Only until 2020 will there be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, the planning political speaker Nicole Palm should now be bought from the city.
In addition, it had to be thought of getting apartments back into the price chain.
This is possible in the West Town.
At one stroke, the problem was solved.
Because in the West City there are deadlines for the end of the year.
Some 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price chain for cheap apartments.
Only: This is what the owners, the housing companies don't want.
Because the number of social housing in the West City is increasing dramatically again, you are far from the objective of the so-called mix.
There should be no more concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens estimate that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group president Holger Herlitschke said: "For a large majority, the CDU must enter the boat."
It has concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes.
What does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot be found?
Pokémon Go, a Hunting for Health and Happiness That Rewards
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens, has been complained about by many in the last decade.
At Pokemon Go it is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially on TV, then on video games and lastly on smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technologies and activities are not mutually exclusive in the open.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the publication of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat early in July.
The market introduction in other countries was moved by the massive demand that the server overloaded.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than teenagers and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (through a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was even younger joined the wank and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person retires every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days after the start of the game, the number of followed-up people who train 30 minutes each day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for increasing performance.
Many public awareness campaigns to health that people want to bring to it "take 30 minutes of time," "from the sofa" and "to be active every day" came upon deaf ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look sad.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of getting sick of cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to bring them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something free to make fun of them.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunlight as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always there are dark game destroyers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What is it?
There's been a break.
Even though smartphone apps such as Fitbit had already been able to track our activity, they gave us no reason to drive sports as this game does.
The new will lose its rice and use will be abandoned in time.
Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activeness in the real world, helping many people to be active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the diamond
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the horse.
Don't worry about it.
Breathing on the ground.
On the whole line brilliant.
And now finally, too, an Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American tournament became a multi-stellar and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the light of the Olympic Games.
Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly in front of the Silver Medal Winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronze Medal Winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American women Simone Biles tour the pool during the single-major competition of women in the arts tournament at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multiple title and totals the five while holding her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her outcome was shown and her long journey in this moment ended.
This success in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has won her sport for the last three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of jealousy and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to family in Spring, returning to Texas, would be seen as disappointment.
The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each after winning gold and silver at the single-major women's tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday,
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exorbitant coordinator of the team at the graduation party of Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during her long journey to the top, that is not really true.
Part of its ground exercises - including its typical Tumbling Pass - are tuned to Latin American music, which would fit home on the street outside the Olympiarena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the tournament, trained in the boorman, became powerful.
She has not lost any more competition since the summer of 2013, a series of victories that will be held as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two turns, the image was worn.
Sweat bars and floor towers - in which Biles holds the world title - earned.
She again picked up 15,433 on the swivel bar - and placed another on the ground with a 15,933.
Raisman hugged her gently when she expected her finality - a pure formality - and tears flowed to Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a rake for the last four years when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went into a tiepbrake at Mustafina.
This time the 22-year-old team captain, called "Oma", had a lead.
After her ground practice she threw her hands to the audience, dominated by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in a serial murder when they heard music in the car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot who died in one of the most deadly attacks in the first serial murder of Phoenix for a decade while listening to the car and music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis Daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight guns from a gun, while he stood on the side of the car and then ran off with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the three-fold murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not include the handbags or $2,900, which were owned by one of the adults.
The police spokesperson of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigator to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed in Spanish residential areas within four months in nine attacks and two others were injured.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a black Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to block the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Linear, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.
One witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting that aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-hour murder and will assume that it was the work of the serial killer.
The researchers found cartridge holes and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microzephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund Microzephalie, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't let myself in on that.
What's not right at all -- of course you've agreed to it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and you were informed that Edmund will never be able to recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that he be institutionalized.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know that people were still doing,' said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with help.
Edmund could not sit or scratch until his third year of life, and he could not even speak.
But he's making slow progress.
He can run with support and bike.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund intended for "Please sing something to me"."
"We'll give him a sign language," Picciuto CBS told news.
But it's not typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as masts or zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how life will affect those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what was going to happen?
What's going on?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis for a long time now because I don't expect her to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the zikavirus.
It's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfalls and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is calculated throughout Saturday with more rainfalls.
Many rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rains, the National Weather Service reported.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that government officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and help to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, said that requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoe alone would have demanded tens of thousands of sand bags.
A flood warning system is being used across parts of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that additional 3 to 5 duties could fall in this area.
In southern Alabama, an early warning system was used on Friday, while it continued raining in the Mobile area.
The river Committee near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will reach all probability after the weekend record level.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the predecessors near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a current-oriented flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger as these will flow only slowly into Lake Maurepas through the flooded rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams still engaged people from the river in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son were among those saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said another stepson who lived nearby would have warned him.
"We are awake and the water flowed and flowed in," Hansford said.
It reached my size.
His wife said that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency aid had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire department in Gloster, where they were placed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flooding had "extended rapidly" as there were still serious rains and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer reported near Livingstone from midnight until Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the ground has been significantly flooded by rain since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rains and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoea Parish and educational failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoe 200 reported overflight houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both now flooded.
The head of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that had been washed from the high water.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoea, almost two dozen streets were closed due to the high water and sandbags were provided for the inhabitants to receive, hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops.
"The last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his statements, a handful of houses on Thursday were to be reported as flooded, but on Friday they were not reported until now.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "by bullets through", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6-year-old child is being shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents reported that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the land, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He made a lot of progress, his small body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the sender.
I just can't believe it.
The condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the messenger that he was likely to be cured again.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are according to CBS Philadelphia in stable condition.
The boy was shot on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition, reports the sender.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police found out exactly if they could be among the injured men of the killers.
CBS Philadelphia reported that it was apparently a crossfire between several shields.
Pattern holes for storm weapons that were traced back to different storm weapons passed through the tator.
It seems clear that this has been an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the road, there were caves.
So it seems that there were several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police chief Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia told the sender.
Several houses and vehicles were also found in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently checking the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbow on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That is what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in the tournament for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been at every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which were inspiring to many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is a Jew and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has fortified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one of the women tournaments was an African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America rejoiced.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they did unexpected but masterful gymnastics.
On Thursday, Simone won the fourth heterosexual American, who won an individual multi-stakeholder event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.
We experience the tops of this kind of sport, but that's how tournament classes don't look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same route as Aly and Madison to create it for the Olympic team.
You are the "Last Five", because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team. Besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality seems to be that tournaments are a expensive sport and tournaments are primarily held in private tournaments that are maintained by parents for training, institution, travel, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their tournaments and families). The list may continue anytime.
Most of these tournaments are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.
In these associations the tournaments receive their entire training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We need to enable the communities to provide even countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, with more affordable and easily accessible tournament training.
I founded my 20-year-old tournament.
At my events we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer young people high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team to make thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that is great.
It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" through the Olympic team gold and thanks, she has motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunts' proposal
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in elections rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to enforce the contract and said that the NHS was in a "Nobody country" and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.
The first assistants are expected to receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and week work to improve the maintenance of unaccompanied hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee on Assisting Doctors last night, said in a statement: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current team crisis and that it will fail to treat all doctors properly."
In only eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress has to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks have been made by the government to participate in protests and sometimes to remain silent in an audacious manner.
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had just made last month that his door would always open.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, lift the upheaval and address the concerns of the assistants."
If he does not do so, it has made it clear to the assistant doctors that they are ready to take further action to combat work.
The last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and doctors were involved in providing cover to doctors on the strike chain.
The Ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS Staff, called on the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Employment measures are not only limited, but are already overloaded teams and service providers and provide patients, caregivers and their families with only anxiety, distress and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee on Assisting Doctors and have responded positively to the Ministry of Health as well as other ministries' concerns about predisposition and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as delivery, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional retirement, training fees, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender-specific wage cases in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was for employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance with agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-per-day medication that can lower the risk of heart pharmacology
Thousands of heart myocardial infarction patients will benefit from a £2-per-day medication after the authorities have recommended that these more people be given for a longer period of time.
The anti-inflammatory medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attack for people with heart disease.
The medicine is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS NICE Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS NICE Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and one quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Cardiac heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the artery walls that form the coatings.
If the coating breaks out, it can cause a blood clot that suppresses the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
If the bloodstream dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and suppress the flow of blood to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The NICE manual, which has been published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg ticagrelor followed by 60mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, one quarter of all people who have had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative effect on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Justice lets electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption from the office
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being deliberately ignored as a devastating government report revealed today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and councillors to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to "sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government, who is now a king of anti-corruption, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up lockdowns outside the electoral booths in order to protect their voters.
He recommends that voters take a statement with them to prove their identity in elections.
Currently, a voter must only name his name and address.
The report proposes to apply non-removeable ink to the finger of a person when they give their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community information and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only intended to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is involved," he said.
The report was ordered by the Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided that mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had brought his critics to silence with racist and Islamic accusations.
Rahman is supposed to "have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a succession in which one person chooses as another.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He said particularly alarmingly about the fraudulent e-mail - the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, represented, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including the lead of evidence to prove the identity
His report states: "As evidence, pressure was placed on members of certain ethnic minorities who were in need of protection, particularly women and young people, in order to choose, as the elderly will, in particular, communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There was concern that... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition that political activists are processing letter material to stop "whalers".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires stronger registration checks to prevent the use of the electoral list for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your proof.
Use non-removeable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible.
A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic notice.
It is prohibited for political activists to process complete letters and envelopes of letters.
The police have the power to set up lockdowns for polling stations.
An amendment which facilitates an action for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksressungsgeitungs Act 1983).
Photographic ban in polling stations.
The requirement that only English should be used in the polling stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training in order to ensure that employees implement the rule that voters go alone into the polling station.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "wonderful", that after the Tower Hamlet case there was no penalty.
"Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices have been unjustly declared by the electoral court," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticises the ineffective "abhak checks" of the electoral registration departments of Council houses.
Sir Eric said, "The court order in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country as the mother of Parliament is a proud heritage, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the lying of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy for Kates Radler doubles and other famous doubles from Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week were on the French bike athlete Pauline Ferrand-Prevot outside the border and band, which proved to be an impressive double-walker of the Duke of Cambridge.
But this summer the 24-year-old Olympics are not the only one to fight for gold, who stands up for his own famous doppelganger - at least not if you can give social media faith.
To honor the Olympics in Rio and all the famous faces that flash on our screens at the time, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain similarity to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: staff member of the United States team in the archery of Brady Ellison, left, will be compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate's two-wheeler on the bike, many people on the Internet have pointed out how a certain arc shield of the twins of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The U.S. crew member in the Archaeology of Brady Ellison has caused a riot on Twitter, after showing pictures on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star uninhabitably.
In fact, the archer got the sense in the social media and admitted that he's already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I see no great similarity myself, except for facial behaviour," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take it as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since 2012 will undoubtedly become even more central this year: the striking similarity between the British Wiesperpinger Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is supposed to be able to pass through as a double-walker for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh will be compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user is the view that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the inception actor
Another constant comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who shows similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sunburned skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalyn McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was certified by Fans to match an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others also liked the similarities
Theory placed in space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smiles, which is almost identical to that of the actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the Gabby Douglas tournament, which presents her own beautiful, wide smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "like a pig died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr. 4x200m outdoor swimming table impressed viewer of the CBC live transfer of the Olympic games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize, after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "died like fog" and during the race as "a pig died".
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freelance pool.
MacDonald, who was taken to the CBS commentary team to give more "color", was able to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, went off like a miscarriage, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming table 1:57,79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which enabled Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
Visitors across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane said, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "how a pig died?"?????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on mission."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m freelance swimming table for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Criticism against Byron MacDonald came on Twitter fast and hard, with many talking to him
Twitter users didn't stay back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly thereafter Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC transmission, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said: "We apologize that the comment about a swimming power has been reflected."
It was an unfortunately selected formulation, we are sorry that it happened."
At the end, CBC apologized more than 90 times to the people who responded to the comments on Twitter
Commentary colleague Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and filed his apology with more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a communication.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been made possible.
We quickly apologized last night to our viewers on the mission and our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments relate to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Yet they were inadequate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is doing what he has said very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that she be exposed as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming staff in the CBC Olympics," he said.
"I have referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark is impressed by a woman who tastes cheap underwear in the middle of the store
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Primmark to try underwear.
To make the situation worse, she had to look like it, and she pulled out and laid her back in the gift.
She went on and tried four pairs of underwear in a shop in Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark Business in Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underwear before she put it back into the regal
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she walked back and left the shop without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she picked up a couple of underwear from the exhibition, pulled out her own trousers and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, like Oskar."
"Everyone looked when she pulled out the underwear that she obviously didn't like, because she put them back into the rule."
She repeated the same with three other underwear before she finally decided that she didn't feel anything, came back and went out.
"They didn't seem to bother that they watched someone - or think about the person who would buy the underwear they had tried under circumstances."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How reprehensible it is to think that someone would take underwear with him at home, who would pick up another person and not be washed."
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: "As I got along, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went - which is as good as it is."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underwear and find out that another woman grabbed them and pulled them out again and they weren't washed."
A spokesperson for Primark said: "Prmark is aware of the event that took place on Tuesday, 9 August at our branch office in Folkstone."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself With Krav Maga From Arms Attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a major master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed thieves at close distance.
Whether you are approaching from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your thief.
When you get closer from the back, you should turn around as the first one so you can see your attacker and "get out of the shooting line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting him with your free elbow.
So beat him with the knee into the joint and turn while the attacker bends before pain, the weapon out of his hands. Smash him with the run towards his face and move back while they point the weapon towards him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, grab the weapon and turn it around so the attacker can not shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of his grip before they move backwards and point the weapon on him.
Does it sound difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how it forms Mizrachi.
But remember that it is safe to hand over your money in a robbery - unless you are a Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright uses his tongue for a guide to the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and bearing reflexes - revealing some of the most filthy and disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk washed his trains on a Euro rail, a gel on the Piccadilly Circus, a wash button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.
Before absconding each object, he used a luminometer to show us and us what he will commit himself to.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of removing the toilet button from a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely distasteful, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright told doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, he did not leave anything that he had revealed more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known for testing the resistance of his intestines by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railway stations to toilets, the task was definitely tested by its immune system.
In the film, he said: "I was already a relatively carefree child, as far as my health is concerned, and I have stuck all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he got his call at all times.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Its sample range showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
Compared to this, the number of luminometers freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to withdraw after its luminometer number was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands showed less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhaker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, "That's the worst thing I've ever smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna put anything in here because it's stupid in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of Valio milk products.
Mr. Wright and Valio Gefilus, which contain both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, are responsible for supporting the promotion of dark bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We conducted crazy brainstorms that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claimed that the interest in abdominal health will become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of abdominal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in abdominal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film, we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film, added: "Let me tell you so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had missed out on some of the things I've directed him to lick, like the stupid Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to draw them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these dirty candy into film."
In a survey carried out by Valio in 2015, 84% of all those surveyed associated with lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomachs and intestines and 58% said that they used at least occasionally the products containing the accompanying lactic acid bacteria.
Social family destroyed before delogation Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
A social family left her social home after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their properties in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their possession, shocked employees of the housing company found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls show striking holes, wooden parts have been torn up, dirt has been scattered on the floor and graffiti has been painted on the walls.
The family was relocated and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute dream for people here and I think people don't have to live like this.
There are many things to consider, since this property is probably seen as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is informed and her name is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had added the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, fights and flees.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, was granted an anti-social procedure in June.
In some areas of the house that will be destroyed under circumstances, old garbage has been found
In the case where drugs have been dealt with in the past, the wood parts have been destroyed
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police regularly
Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner violently this week from the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.
Delogation was thrilled by the relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made hell.
One of them said, "They didn't complain about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we say to the police here are incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now, where they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have neglected the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overhauled side of the municipality house trash and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and her family because a delogation is always the last step taken by Cornwall Houseing.
This was a very difficult case, since the conduct was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be terribly taken into account.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and members of the community who have courageously come to us and let us have the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbours comfort and convey the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the house's bedrooms after delogation on the ground
Houseworkers will now have to remove Müllberge which surrounds the house
In 2014, the police conducted a race in the house and found more than 70g cannabis as well as weights, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had been convicted of possession of a class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Tanya and her partner are expected to live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were walled with graffiti.
The police say they'll delogate tenants who don't stick to the house rules.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police told us that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the household regulations.
"This is for those who think they can move without self-destruction and those who have been damaged by such behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Traveling tourists in Portugal in panic after a deep-flying military beach
Solarists in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force placed an incredible crash flight
The Air Force reported that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when the frightened tourists began to panic after a deep - flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost close to the sunbursts on the beach section of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The vacationers jumped up when they understoodably began to worry about the noise of the thunderstorms, without first seeing what came upon them through the clouds.
The event took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said: "It really flew over twice and there was a moment when it looked as if it would collapse."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would drop on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came from the darkness and incredibly deep flew
The Portuguese Air Force reported today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that the jet was slightly deeper than the usual fleet due to poor visibility, but the air forces insisted that safety had not been compromised at any time.
Surface fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force reported today that the pilot had to fly so deep because of the conditions - strong fog and smoke - that his vision was limited.
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot fishing boat had to identify as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Seville
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights for the first step on Sunday for the first title win in the new football season.
The Catalans enter the duel around the Spanish Supercup outside against the FC Seville, the back game rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner must give up on Neymar, among other things, with the subordinate Cup finalists and the ruling European League champion, who fights with Brazil the Olympic Football tournament.
There is also a lack of Gaulie Marc-Andre on the way.
In training, the German suffers from a knee suffocation, which at least makes clear the question at Barca in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for two years as number one.
Coach Luis Enrique so far refused to make a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but for that, Ter Stegen in most other applications won.
Before the first performance of the new play time, there is a doubt about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Even at 3:2 in the battle against Sampdoria on Wednesday Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know how to convince.
Sevilla, in turn, has to evaporate the 2:3 defeat after enlargement in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona has so far had eleven success of the record winners in this competition.
Ma Long in his own league with table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic player.
On Thursday in Rio de Janeiro, the 27-year-old beat his countryman and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4).
Thus the World rankings first won the Golden Grand Slam with success at WM, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and just Olympia.
Bronze went to Japan's Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and became the title of each other.
So it was clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would get the individual title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese at the top Olympics was the former SVS NÖ Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the plate, between the sets and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the Tribune and left their shields alone in fair competition.
"The matches so far have I played for my country."
"In the finals I play for myself," Zhang had said correctly.
After the party, the gold and silver medal winner with the Chinese flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly unilateral.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang only 13 points from there.
Due to Ma's superiority, the expected match did not develop.
However, they were not able to see enough stunning ball changes.
Mizutani won the bronze game against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter finale against the German European Master Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the white Russian had suffered a rib injury, was then in medical treatment, had to "at last" satisfy himself with blech.
The Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) became similar in high table tennis age Olympics.
Donald Trump solves ′′healing problems′′ in the election struggle
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is encouraged by massive concerns to make use of their majority in traditional conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now given up his campaign in the former Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and self-evident multimillionaire expressed some concern, as reporters reported.
After he threw 16 rivals into his own Republican camp, the doubt of his success in the fight for the White House grew.
"We have enormous problems in Utah," Trump told evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important federal states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Guilty were false reports about his candidacy, he again recorded his well-known media signal.
Republishing of high-level castles
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his rival from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the same footing.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, however, not with the distance usual for Republican candidates in the federal state.
Arizona and Georgia are also in danger.
In an interview with the broadcaster CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's front march again: "Just like I've done so far".
And push behind: "This will either be successful, or I will make a very nice, long vacation".
He does nothing but "telling the truth".
If it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, then that's okay, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party should have threatened to delete funds to support its election struggle, and should not be able to present any better survey values.
Instead, the candidates of the Republicans for the Congress are more likely to get under the arms.
Olympia: Great fraud at Doping Test
The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary committee.
Kenya's lightweight athletes threaten after the second doping affair at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
After an attempted fraud at a doping check in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee was informed to set up an immediate disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village had passed a urine sample under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported by the Doping Controllers on the Kenya team.
The IAAF World Association asked the IOC for information on the case in order to exert its own investigations, an IAAF speaker said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures by the IOC will be evaluated by the IAAF," it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the Doping Control Station and has been released as Ferguson Rotich, who passed the test and signed," said Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for training checks of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich became over 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing World War II.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Lichthaltetik delegation chief Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio games.
He is supposed to have informed against money payments to athletes in his country about upcoming doping tests.
According to media reports, he was to be arrested at the airport of Nairobi on his return.
Kenya has been under special observation for a long time since many doping events at the IOC.
In the announcement of the more than 2000 Doping target controls imposed by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusual to note that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were being taken into the visa.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping combat is in accordance with the WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a major runner nation.
The country's light athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of ARD television reports have repeatedly raised allegations that doping media is easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sport fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had employed in the Russian light athletics.
It could be demonstrated that this type of sport has been embroiled and systematically baptized.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, like Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artist leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical and fulfilled the role of Mary as a youth dream.
In the orchestra tomb the Simón Bolívar Orchestra led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he screams.
We always say she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this scene Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She fondly remembers her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because she's musically exceptional!
And then it would still be Mary's personality.
She says in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and white and bright".
So she's smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She is very much like me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Directing is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, which is at all very important!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly relevant: "In this piece it is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as powerful today as they were then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirls who joined the IS were killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British girls who left London last year to join the IS, died reports in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family experienced some weeks ago from her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's bowling plant in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good lies in it - as an opinion and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015 Sultana and two other girls from East London entered a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was informed that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and had become a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of an election at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will be nominated as Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his appointment by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in Senator Mitch McConnell is the view that the next president will be appointed successor to the deceased judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
On Thursday, Reid said during a telephone conference that he expected to select Garland from Clinton "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker from Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, were lakaien and assistants of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also stated that Donald Trump was inappropriate for the president's office.
Treatments wants Naktcalendar for "Women and for Men"
The treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemère to produce a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Museum Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us early this year that his naked magazine of Oldschool-Playboys was different since "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing it for women.
Apparently he thinks it does the calendar too.
"We need to return to the representation of timeless and classic nuances, in which both women and men feel well and are inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release about the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting event in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality with mass flight
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, president of the Golden-Near Foundation of Dialogue and World.
In the short term, the Kurdish municipality of Germany counts with tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand", says Ali Toprak, president of the Association.
Due to the harsh conduct of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup attempt, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I count with tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand defenders from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition," said Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday.
Because the government had already overrun Kurdish high castles with fines months ago, 500,000 Kurds were on the run within Turkey.
After the defeated Putsch there are still secular and opposition ethnic Turks.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that owns refugees produces refugees in its own country," Toprak said.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in alevitian cities.
So Erdogan wants to increase the output pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or dispersed in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the union demanded that the federal government "as sharp as Austria is against Erdogan and its supporters".
In Germany too, a "Hexenjagd" takes place against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe for the first time in the last few months in Germany.
The German branch of the Golden Movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition.
The branding as a guille pendant destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, including the Chemalists and Seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, president of the Golden-Founding Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the paper called for by the Federal Ministry of the Interior reports, the Turks already presented to Putsch the largest group of asylum-seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany.
By 30 June, these were 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all asylum-seekers (39.625).
In this survey, the victims of war, poverty or invisibility are not found.
Asylum-related under the Basic Law are only politically, i.e. on the part of the State, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Rare Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The natives do not get anything from the summer election fight - and the holidayers from Nordrhein-Westfalen must not choose the holiday.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
2021 will not be held again at the end of the summer holidays, the Heavy Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because more bleeding than ever is not going on: summer holidays, heat and country day elections - that's what it is.
The locals to be persuaded by the voters are on holiday.
Most holidayers who are in the country on the road to Usedom, Rügen or Hidden Lake are not native, so they must not choose the country day.
Practical problems come along: In the holidays there are helpers who hang the posters, blow up air balloons, distribute flyers and count voices at the end, just to drive them hard.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again allow election struggles to pass almost on to the people.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.
And it is also something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It's exciting how much Neuling AfD is cut off and what remains at the end of the coalition.
Selling, 66 years old and since 2008 government chief, makes an almost invincible election struggle, you look away from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and boasts a little with the people, as well as his legendary valuer Harald Ringstorff has already done.
Otherwise, Sailing received cold feet and gave Chancellor Merkel the blame for the flowering of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "we create this" has accelerated the rise of law-enforcement populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenzo Caffeier, has already experienced what it is like when you make the right choice at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major awards; Merkel Bundestagsvohlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Sachsen there as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority of other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it didn't hurt anyone from other corners of Germany to hear Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely ignores the usual electoral stand on market places and in front of shopping centers with sunscreens and balloons.
That, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noted that it has lost its ground on the ground that it must work very hard to find a wire to the people again.
You go like the left, the SPD, the green: there is hardly any place in the country.
However, the advice of the CDU fighter Kokert to his rivals is self-defeated: "They have to go where it hurts, where people are: Villagers, Golden Weddings, Every birthday party must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed election struggle.
Social Democrats last surveyed 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and only shortly before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had won a clear 35.6 per cent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are allowed to make the jump in the countryside.
They make out of the holiday emergency a modern virtue and place their struggle largely on the Internet.
"Online election struggle," it is called the country president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, there are green voters looking for local voters among the holidayers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curves with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lake and finds it even nice.
Her impression is: "Wahlok in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no punishment".
B27 Sanitation: Hospitals suffering from constipation
At the speed with which the B 27 is repaired, there is nothing to mecker.
For the construction managers, who start at 5.30 in the morning and only end at 20 a.m., there is half a praise.
"They've made everything pretty crazy," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet tank.
That's a super team.
There's no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the building could be moved to the south by the end of October.
It will also be promised the agreement of the responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of assistance.
Since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße has also been lifted in Otterdingen and thus the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation has relaxed within the place.
The citizens can now go back and forth from supplies from the B27.
It seems to be going back by the place.
"There were partly significant complaints," says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the repair.
The inhabitants of Bachsatstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many trails were looking for and more trusted in their ship than the description.
What led some trucks to freeze in residential areas.
In the absence of compliance with the speed limits, the municipality called for a stronger vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant oversteps," says King, who made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
There have already been two to three per minute flashing.
The fastest was in the Tempo-30 zone with 77 hours.
Since the construction site has been moved, however, it has become more quiet.
For business people at B27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rottenburg the street is now open again.
Business people don't like to look into the cards.
But that the B 27-sanction has led to revenue disruptions in them, lets anyone who is asked to see.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Whoever has less to do with the "end customer" so produces for other companies, for which the restoration has little consequences.
Also at the Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a "most slight decline", but also admits that of course "the running skills are missing".
The locals are most valued along the street.
J. Albert Gohner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not just him, but all the guesthouses have "has met".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro.
It refers to "more than 50 percent" revenue.
The road sanitation has "refused its operation for two years".
Half of his employees had to be fired.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been fired, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Schmidt replied to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the note that the guesthouse benefited otherwise from the benefits of the situation at B 27. Now it also had to bear the disadvantages resulting from the restoration.
Göhner knows from other rural areas where something more generous has been handled.
In all complaints, Gohner is confident that his guesthouse will continue.
Finally, since 1715, the family has been living here, referring to the long history.
The other family guests are now less often overlooked because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand.
If you can't get out, it's nice.
The return of his family client after the completion of the repair work has no doubt about it.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Gohner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction work on his knowledge of the biggest crisis that his guesthouse has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, this is already brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being violated.
After the latest attacks, Minister de Maizière of the Interior now presents a thick safety package.
But what does a state of alienation have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all that?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator.
All his proposals were "politically acceptable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior when presenting his new security package.
They don't demand anyone.
Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm part of it too.
However, as the Minister of Interior, he was located on results and on a "chievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière allowed a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now more extensive.
Some are already known, announced, indicated: The fact that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on aviation data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is not surprising.
In part, de Maizière launches a second call for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and join the German passport with dual citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner does not have.
A few new ideas also present de Maizière.
They have part in it: He plans rapid procedures for decommissioning and more possibilities for arresting people before decommissioning.
Refugees are expected to check their smartphones first and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of cancellations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately discard their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of these are political and legally weak.
Some still seem unsatisfied and open up questions.
And in some points - for example, in the treatment of the patient - the question is: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it can't be said in Abrede that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, in view of the high numbers of refugees, many people were concerned about security.
And things that people were deeply concerned about could not get out of hand even in times of election.
Internal security is enormously focused.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The pollution is great.
And yes, there are election struggles.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly concerned with internal security.
In the past few days, there has been a rise between the two parties.
Only a heated dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a political collection of security ideas from some Union interior ministers, in which the head of resources also calls for a Burka ban and a reversal of dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also concerned about reconciliation.
He didn't hold anything from a double pass.
We have freed the discussion in Germany.
Don't make any sense to open them up again.
And in a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is a constitutional party at all corners and whether it is actually "appropriate" for the coalition partner, must be shown first.
There's something in it that can make a difference.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel first signals cautious willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security further".
Still, Volkswagen's going through a lot of trouble.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery numbers are increasing worldwide.
But not all markets run around.
In the case of the retreat there is a worm about a term.
Volkswagen starts on deliveries of the carrier in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest car manufacturer can continue to offer a plus in the course of the past year, despite its many brands and some well-running markets.
In July, however, the VW core brand weakened especially in Western Europe and again charged the total sales, as reported by the company mentioned in Dax.
The brand VW sold worldwide in July with 449100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, after China's second largest market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the domestic market in Germany, the deliveries dropped by almost a sixth.
Jürgen Stackmann, the brand sales manager, led the weaker figures from July, mainly on two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, "changed economic conditions" have made it possible to buy.
In addition to the situation surrounding Turkey's coup attempt, a speaker explained that the British vote had been forced to withdraw from the EU.
In the United States, where the gas business was first escalated, there is also another minus to book.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected household brand of the Lower Saxony is still slimy by the Diesel Candal: After the first seven months, only a 0.9 percent delivery minus is available to 3.37 million vehicles.
From January to July, Group Sales Manager Fred Kappler was able to continue to sell.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered cars at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars to refurbish the workshops.
During the refurbishment, VW confirmed that the refurbishment of the cars had no negative effects.
After refurbishment of vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
After the refurbishment, the car manufacturer provides the customer with a "guarantee-like" certificate, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in business circles.
There are legal fines.
The Focus had reported that Volkswagen now provides its German customers with a guarantee for refurbished diesel models.
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to fulfil the tasks of my investigation commission and the KBA fully."
"Deviations from this are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has assumed that there are no deteriorations in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the refurbishment and that all relevant vehicle approval values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen himself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers will come to a workshop for example in half a year after refurbishment - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the customer interest to avoid any other damage that may have nothing to do with the gas scandal as it has been said.
This is why VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savings in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
On Thursday, bank manager Josef Paul said, "It is only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or Day-Cash."
The German Banken federation speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it: Normal savers should "not be afraid to pay for their savings.
Banks have to pay 0.4% of their fines at night at the European Central Bank (ECB).
This fee will be charged by the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros to Giro or Day-Central Accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs for the future 400 euros a year," said Paul.
He has for some time been protecting 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he cannot use.
"They are on my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the chief bank manager.
"I can't spend $4,000 for every million."
He now discloses the costs according to the principle of cause.
The cash just lying in the vaults of the Raiffeisenbank would be too dangerous: "I've already experienced four injuries, I don't like the fifth!" said the Banking Board.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of investment.
Only a few went to other banks.
The association Bayern stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate causes significant costs for all banks".
They should be carried on their own, be "non-permanent economics".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for accounting, credit cards or transfers.
With a fine of EUR 3 million, the Thuringia People's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land, with its Skatbank branch, made 2014 strike lines.
Michael Kmmer, head of business of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay flat-rate payments for deposits, to which competition in Germany is too strong under banks and savings".
One banker said there is "a client who is equipped with something more sophisticated by means of the property" at Lake Tegern.
"This can become a problem for a small bank," when she saves free money.
The Gmund Association Bank, founded in 1911, has branch offices in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region, well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.
The Bayern Association of Societies "is currently not known to any other banks that calculate a replacement for deposits of private customers," said the speaker Ernst.
At the end of June, the president of the German Association of National Banks and Raiffeisenbanks (BVR), Uwe Höhllich, had declared: "The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
Competition is tough, and it threatens the relocation of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not be allowed to do so in the widest sense.
Destination plates: who actually buys sound boards?
Single men of middle age love records.
Before you move on to the comment part to pass it under the Pseudonym NotAllExcellent MenMeddlersAlters with severe insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the many-proclaimed re-resurrection of sound boards is not about a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but about midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a plate are expected to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.
It is also not a flock by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do you agree with the results of YeGov?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me, while I'm running in the middle of a business street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit, and playing wildly, before I stand, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "So let's take a closer look at it."
So let's take a look at it.
Even if the heart of Sohos slowly interferes with its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there are still fantastic special disc shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and courage by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow by Sister Ray (number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector?
"I appreciate it," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These billboards, painted above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold again when he was young and struggling.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably too young to buy them for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the plates are rather introverted and prefer to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my cargo.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets are going to the YouTube profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and who want to see themselves buying their old records again.
From the conversations I have conducted, people have generally given up their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy themselves again," he says.
This would explain the tree to supporters of the record Revival of a certain age.
But what about the apparent emotional significance of discs?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phoenix to realize that disc shops offer a relaxing community of equals.
According to Wez, some of the older customers attacked the contactless payment system.
Some disc fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted billboard holes, from things that call for happy young girls.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or the possession of material owners as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
It's like this with me as a collector, and I think it's like this with many people.
It is a simple way to engage mentally.
"We are like their social workers!" a member of the board floats away.
An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month had not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I am blaring through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (date number: three men of middle age), has noticed a "tropean aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead sound board so I can put it in the hand," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-ridden, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones who come in slowly.
Popp, who's devoted almost a whole floor to the sound board, has a more colorful audience than I do.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenagers and women of middle age.
Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts' latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz shrinks from speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers.
None of them look lonely, but naked mental traumas are hard to determine when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates standing for sale.
She'd rather make a sheep star bomb than a big deal.
She doesn't deserve much, so the collection of discs is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of discs is..." she drives off with a loved one.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of album lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I was making the appearance to sample the Jeans Hotpants, I watched a group of young teenage teenagers grouping themselves for a moment around Polaroid Cameras before a father and his daughter decided to buy a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorative, some as far up as it is impossible to catch them.
It's pure "platten art".
But in view of the fact that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most of it for luxury items such as plates.
Even if my research has shown that youGov's results are correct, they do not take into account the large number of female collectors and album lovers who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They will certainly not spend their Thursday morning with the booming through the Berwick Street record shops and the leaves through boards, while they avoid the staring look of a mysterious, 30-year-old false moderator who does not hold back over the shoulders of men of middle age.
The Greenland Hai is the longest live vertebrae - video report
Scientists say that Greenland hai has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates the Haie, says that the record was with a woman who will assume that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer on abbreviation of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to bring down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be competent to dispose of 72 provisional shops in which persons within the warehouse of goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
Prefecture Calais argued that these places should be lowered because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also argued that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating 72 provisional business, but admitted that Calais's prefecture concerns were "absolutely reproducible."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than feeding only people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the descent was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated jointly and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to celebrate the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure "would be a disaster for these children, of whom the last eight years are."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrant estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympia's disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic period, Radprofi Tony Martin will not be able to sign.
"I keep the WM in view, remain confident and fight further," the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He doesn't have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time," Martin said.
He had to analyze in silence the reasons for the debacle.
In October in Qatar, Martin wanted to fight for the title.
"I'm going to look at everything we've changed lately."
"It also includes my position," wrote the three-time timer world champion who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at 54.5 km on the Fabian Cancelara (Switzerland) Olympics.
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siegemund missed half-finals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in Rio's fourth final: the world rankings-32rd from Metzingen missed a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) the half final of the Olympic tennis tournament is clear.
Siegemund, which was claimed by back problems, was only able to pass through its attack once and it was powerless in comparison to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) still had the chance to jump to the preamble.
The Australian Open Winner met British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas 2000 had won a medal (silver) in Sydney.
Two German DTB-starters at the Fourth Summer Games Final had been last released in 1992.
A German duo never stood in an Olympic single half-final.
Group rises at startup for live video playback
Other people watch video games, is a giant trend - of which Microsoft also wants to benefit.
The technology group buys the Start-up Beam that specializes in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the takeover, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
With his offer, Beam only started in January and has already more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give the players missions and confront enemies and provide equipment.
The Game Activation Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook will help.
The advertising industry has already stopped.
The staff of the start-up, which has so far been based in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A., are moving to Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and Chief Matt Salsamendi announced.
Therefore, the acquisition should not change anything for the customers.
Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought in 2014 by the online dealer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is one of the Google Mother's Alphabets.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's racer needs to adjust to the next generation of speed meters: in various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flashing devices are being tested, which are particularly effective for temporary offenders.
For example, the futuristic Enforcement Trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used at random points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no necessary infrastructure for the construction of motorways or for rehabilitating bridges with temporary tempolimits to ensure that there is a stationary flasher for compliance with the speed limitation.
A permanent mobile building can be too dangerous or too expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is autarch: Its battery holds in uninterrupted measuring operation for five days, the case data will be transmitted via a modem.
In addition, laser measuring techniques can detect all vehicles over several tracks at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as travel bans according to time, driving ranges and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-risk state, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling.
In order not to be easily sewn, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and also protective outer lids.
In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and is currently being used according to Vitronic's data in various federal countries.
Foreign authorities are also bling with the new technology: France has recently ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK holds silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold holds
The impressive performance of Britain at the 7th Rugby finally came to an abrupt stop on Thursday evening in the form of Fiji when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, back, line run and raw force to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was satisfied by the not too bad silver medal - the fourth of Britain on this day - and they were able to be very proud of their efforts in this tournament, where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear downfall of the boxes, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall on them in the final.
But no matter what, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best form.
It could be a comfort to GB - but it probably won't - that at least one British medal will have hung around his neck tomorrow: Fiji Chief Coach Ben Ryan, former Head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a hard way behind him.
Eight years ago they lost every game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only one.
This fold is going to hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs take off from the spas.
It felt like it was for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run in running buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Ocean Kolinisau crossed the corner.
With four more minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he turned.
12-0 and GB barely hit the ball.
A great tack of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leon Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua looked at a touchdown in the right corner and stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the resume and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravuvouu was pushing through further weak hacks of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a door.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to break.
It's like Fiji was born to play 7 while GB is still learning.
That's how it is.
GB made fundamental changes in half-time and closed the Fijian gap...for four minutes, which was good for the first half-time conditions until Joshua Tuisova passed through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had already lasted for a long time in favor of the southern islands whose fans sang, flagged and danced on the Tribune.
It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the i-tuff with another attempt in the last seconds.
The pfiff broke, the Fijians hugged and GB looked devastatingly beat in the roots.
Earlier that day Fiji Japan had won at the semifinal with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a short half-final match from the race - the conversion of the difference in Britain.
Kyle Brown brought the box in the first half forward, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footing and reached a door under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant later tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, won - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the trainer's cancer to the rudder win
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that's what it means.
From the first rudder blow to the last, 220 hard hives entering history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two who sat on the ruder, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was everywhere when they rowed for the second Olympic gold in the twin without a taxwoman, the first women in the history of British sport who put such a scale.
Her dominance was absolute, yet her 39th unbeatable use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes walking across the surface with the elegance of pigs, which does not fully reflect the type of triumph.
Behind every gold in the rudder is a battalion of volunteers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the trainer who did not know if he would survive this day at all than cancer was diagnosed with.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the perspective a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if it was the right term under such circumstances at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and went around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rudering is already a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.
In the immediateness of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking more than anything else and trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was the main man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an application in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me how much Helen and I have worked with Robin.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thanks goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I wouldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not endure.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to unravel, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important not to get involved.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't about to do something great.
We didn't want a fire work today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a period of time for one year before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover must appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years provided for clarity
The executive director of the Water Purpose Association "Vietensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, goes to rest.
The association is considered to be "bairn-wide."
A small French beverage-water association as an example for large water producers.
So it was in the original tone some time ago in a contribution to the Bavarian radio.
A few days later, the water forum of the government of sub-frontiers praised the association for its purpose.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe is considered "bayernwei" as exemplary.
Rupert Goller, who was an employee for 31 years, is behind all of this, 28 years as manager.
Now at the age of 65, he was adopted into retirement.
The drinking water-water association of the Veitensteingruppe with seat in Kottendorf, the municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150000 cubic metres of water annually and provides 32 places and Weiler with approximately 5500 inhabitants.
Memberships are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water delivery contracts.
The current president, Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed a water guard in 1985 and was appointed manager of the association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, the calculation of fees and contributions to emergency expenses at weekends," said the president.
As an outstanding event, it called for the establishment and dedication of the new sources (1994), the acquisition of real estate in the field of new sources (1998) and the compensation of farmers, the repair of the high tanks (1999), the re-establishment of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There has been no silence and innovations have been repeated because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio she praised Goller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He used a lot of heart blood for his association of water purposes and he lived the association of water purposes regularly as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the concept of success of the weighting group for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the district of underfrequents.
He has gained a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterguard and he was a faithful knocker.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As a highlight of his view, he referred to the building of wells and the restructuring of the association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, were the tube break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here at minus 17 degrees will have to work all night so that the villages can be provided with water.
The supply of Neubrunn has also been maintained only once because it filled Pettstadt’s high tank with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Water Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who follows Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko opens up with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed she had to die.
However, the eight-year-old Tiago has come forward and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that lies behind two years when I sing at the Mail country Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Nettrebko's connection to the bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship State in Bartheheide - Man shoots at life danger
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10.45 a.m. in a multifamily house in Barteheide (Kreis Stormmarn) and killed her.
"The man himself called and said to have shot his life companion," said a police spokesman.
The killer will be on the run, followed by the public.
In the middle of the country, Sven S. could be on the road.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, burns and has a glare.
Meanwhile, the police published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a glazing.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, so the police.
Anyone who sees Sven S. is supposed to call 110.
The police are talking about a relationship state.
The victim was in 1988, the perpetrator of 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially did not want to make any mention of the course or the relationship between the killer and the victim; however, they confirmed that a man had been killed.
"It's a murder warrant."
"We're not saying anymore," said a police spokesman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitness evidence, a special use command (SEK) was at the tabernacle.
Steel - Lighting for German steel industry
The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry continues to bear additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the ecosystem industry are from the table.
It remains in the case of the release of the renewable energy package from the so-called own-current production plants in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General News" (WAZ, release).
"I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of closer negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore first planned to ask steel producers to use the gas from the power plant to produce electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of between EUR 120 million and EUR 240 million per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works will an EEG envelope fall by 20 percent.
However, these will not be raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on its own power generation.
This determines the status of Quo of the previous scheme.
Gabriel's success in the steel industry is of particular importance.
"In view of our campaign 'Steel is a future', this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment objectives are also to be considered in the reform of emissions trading," explained IG Metal Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen as the world's largest producer country of China threw massive steel on the world market in the face of weak domestic demand.
European producers are putting forward price dumping to Chinese steel groups.
In the course of this spring, the situation has become somewhat relaxed.
Import duties on steel have been shown to have an effect on one side, while economic prospects in China have fallen.
It is unclear how sustainable pricing is.
The German industry primpius Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Last time, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Finally, Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, the German steel producers remained careful in spite of rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced with 3.4 million tonnes of good six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the Association of Economics announced steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been below the previous year's value by two percent.
The association will be counting in the coming months as a result of an improved ordering situation with an increasing output.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing makes seniors good
The song has already accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl she was in school choir, in the teacher's studio she wore the music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a test, she feels balanced, happy, and alive at all, she says.
In addition, she does something good for her health and her mind.
Because Singing is from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniors.
Most seniors sing in choirs and share the joy of music with peers, says Hackler.
Through regular association, seniors can bond and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures break up in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To agree and organize, to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of interaction".
Singing can be positive, says Hacker.
Because seniors train a deep and controlled breath.
He who regularly demands his lung does not get out of the shower at all.
Even if it is about getting the sound of voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.
On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organisations.
In the older generations, the common song had a much higher place value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Because of lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia themselves are attracted to long-standing events.
In singing, a special performance is also required for the head, Lenz explains.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and on a predetermined rhythm and adapt to other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.
Just older people who live alone practice not just to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you experience by singing in the choir, Hacker says.
A thrilled audience is a great praise.
The feeling of self-esteem also grows by singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.
So there are good reasons to start singing.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who listens when a sound goes down?
Looking for the right offer seniors have different options, Hacker says.
If someone from the community is in a senior choir, you can just join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the auditorium in the area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the congregation or to the head of the church.
Many seniors are also found on the Internet.
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the Internet search.
Whoever wants to sing should definitely join a choir, hacker said.
Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - this applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than a cat on the prey of young animals
Biologists in Hannover have examined the effect of calling cats babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the Mioen also did not let the men cold - however, they always treated themselves the same as the women.
Female cats can recognize the degree of achievement of cats at the mioen of the little ones.
They respond ten percent faster to the sound of cats who are in great need, as scientists have found out from the Hanover University of Animal Medicine and the Hanover Medical School (MHHH).
Kater also reacts to the call of cats - however, always the same.
"It is obvious that the acoustic differences between the mioen of less and stronger young animals for men are either undetectable or not significant," said biologist Wiebke Konerding from MHH.
She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the team of researchers had already found that the length and height of the cat's cry differs with the urgency of its need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the maintenance of the MHH.
You were expected to be called by children who were taken out of the draft box for three minutes and separated by mothers and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with the screams of stronger raised cats, which were further raised.
The researchers consider their results to be strong despite the low sample.
"All women, even those who had not yet had their own upbringing, responded differently to the cry," Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker more quickly when this call of the much more generous cats played.
This ability may be born or developed with the sex liner.
"A surprise was that the men had reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noise.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, whether they were mothers or not, according to biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski grab with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sugar is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant was issued against the former Hakan Sukür football star.
He is proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the Putsch trial, an important football game is again taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the Erzrivalen between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is spoken.
Even when the state of emergency was suspended after the coup attempt in July, the government was not to be affected by the everyday life of ordinary people.
However, this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gulen, who is made responsible for the coup attempt.
It is also not held in front of the football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the state prosecutor issued a warrant.
Thus, the sugar currently living in America is proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
Sugar is to be the adherent of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is made responsible by the President of the State Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the derogation for the first 90 days still applies until October, in fact it has no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The Night's "Democracy Watches" in public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan finished on Wednesday.
Sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogans.
Especially fans of the Labour Club visit are not traditionally among the President's friends.
What the Great of the Turks, however, involves in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military bullets.
Even the fans agree on whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At Pokalsieger "Gala" it will come back especially to Lukas Podolski.
His sports value was demonstrated by the Kölner in the past season: With 17 doors and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first playing time as the top runner of his association.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he achieved the 1:0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured the podium for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the recordmaster found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the first round-K.o in the Champions League, the "Lews" also separated early in the Europa League.
In the Super League it's only about six.
The season wasn't good.
The pod was the only way to win something.
"We did it and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the 14th title as a super-Lig-Torschütz king with 26 seasons.
That is also why the fans continue to look forward to the return of the 31-year-old.
In doing so, the Gomez under contract with AC Florence and the Gomez lent to Besiktas had announced only after the coup attempt not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM leave.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the professional magazine "Kicker" Club Chief Fikret Orman.
But the stormer had to be willing to give up about a third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already locked up twice due to dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa must not start in Rio.
Other transferred light athletic criminals can only laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The theme of Doping continues as before the battle lines at the Olympics in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julia Jefimova, who, after a doping-block, had her right to begin the games, was excitedly kicked and blown off at her start (100 meters breast).
There was a scurrying scenario: With a smile set she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her performance.
When she said she wouldn't get any gold, the audience broke into a jubilee storm.
However, there are still many other athletes who are starting out despite the Doping past of the Olympics in Rio.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-stuff/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in light athletics.
He was already locked up twice due to doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his band, the 2004 and former world champions have run even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered by Usain Bolt as the biggest challenger.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Price (100, 4x100-m-stuff/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-month world champion had to leave a six-month barrier in 2010, after being shown to take the oxycodon pain medication.
She had severe dental pains after surgery, the 29-year-old defended himself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, 2013 World Champion and European champion from 2010 to 2016 were positively tested on the forbidden stimulants medium methylhexanamine.
Perkovic opposes the scientific intake and has been blocked for six months.
The four largest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-stufffel/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and double world champion over 400 m, was positively tested in 2010 and was suspended for 21 months.
A resource for penis enlargement has been responsible, respected merritt.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 metres from the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammer's draft, Belarus): It is unlikely that so many medals were subsequently recognized by an athlete.
Tichon lost his WM title from 2005, nine years later, after being found at testosterone doping.
Meanwhile, the 40-year-old also had to give up Olympia-Silber in 2004 due to steroid dippings and the EM title in 2006 due to testosterone abuse.
The well-known bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also received due to a judgment by the International Court of Sport CAS.
With 80.04 m he is in rank two of the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km) Go, China: The World Recorder and Gold Favoritin were tested positively only in May, but can still start in Rio.
The 29-year-old World Champion was given instructions on the intake of a prohibited food supplement, the strain of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mildly and departed on 13 July.
Bombing error in Thailand - Austria injured - Several deaths
The Austrian message in Thailand was in contact with the woman, said the spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnoll, Friday morning.
They have suffered from cut wounds and have been treated in the hospital, but have already been able to leave this.
Her home trip was planned for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the island of Phuket as well as in the southern towns of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, be it unclear first.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been in constant contact with the local authorities, as soon as possible.
In the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok, Hua Hin was first bombed on Thursday evening in a quarter of a century.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including Austrians, three Germans, three Netherlands and three Italians.
In the early hours of the Friday morning, there were two explosions, and another person was killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the early morning.
In the detonation near the beach Patong popular with vacationers, a taxi driver was injured after police reports.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a urban employee.
According to the authorities, in a flower-bed in front of the Coastal Police River, the blast rate has gone into the air.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and Chumphon on the south-east coast caused several injuries.
You're going from a connection to the explosions in Hua Hin, it's called.
"The bomb night days carry the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmetavee Friday morning before journalists.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to speak of possible motives - but it is probably about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical of Muslim separatists bomb night days in the south of the country.
On the other hand, the Thai police explained that the assassinations are not related to the Islamic rebellion or to international terrorism.
"This is only local Saturdays that are limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Instead, they assume that the bombs were planted by enemies of the ruling military union.
In recent days, the authorities have received confidential information on forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they have not been informed about the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attack.
The police urged their officials across the country to strengthen security in important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are increasingly smaller bomb attacks, but they do not usually address tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used over the years by King Bhumibol Aduliadej of Thailand.
Following the current bombings, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songghla as well as to Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
Following disagreements between security forces and Muslim populations, no necessary travel will be reported in these provinces.
Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military.
This will have a major influence on the military in the coming years as well.
Junta-Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to establish chaos, while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism.
The militaryrunta, which had taken power after a phase of bloody unrest in 2014, is of its own advantage to have the kingdom restored to stability and order.
However, it has not been possible for the military to get the rise of Muslim rebels that have been raging in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok during an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack of the country's recent history.
The right "Identifical Movement" is entered into the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several country offices, the constitutionalists in the federation have also observed the group.
"We see points of reference at the 'Identitary Movement' for efforts against the liberal democratic fundamental order," said author Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are extremistly affected.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitary Movement" is a group with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "Multicultural Road", "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "lost identity of its own by overcoming".
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - have already observed the "Identifiers".
He said that his authority had taken a close look at the decision.
"Groups like the 'identitary movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the head of the constitutional guard.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music.
That's what the Islamists do, as well as the right-wing extremists.
That's not a significant advertising for your own business.
Propaganda is supposed to address people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Last time, there were reports from several federal states about the contacts of the "Identifiers" with AfD politicians.
He said he didn't have any clue.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind will only be relevant from a certain point of view.
It is clear whether the respective party - in this case, the AfD - has changed its target direction by certain persons who are extremist and becomes so extremist.
It is therefore crucial that such persons have a dominant influence on the party.
This is not detectable.
In view of the clear increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, he would not speak of new legal terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freelance Group.
It can be quite clear that other right-wing terrorist groups or minority groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a comprehensive or European control of legal terrorism is not detectable.
The former groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Concernedly, measures were expressed that many of the abuses on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the concern.
Many of the suspects were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene during attacks on asylum.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists who may have been politically indifferent or, for example, had chosen CDU, SPD or left, which then have radicalized themselves by right-wingist moods."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes the Internet hit
The Olympics or world record do not always determine the beats at the Olympics.
This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros had in the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, having subsequently become the viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ends with a 48-second delay of his predecessor and placed the 59th place of 59 beginners.
But it was rather his not just sporting figure that drew the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was granted a special start-up right from the International Swimming Union.
This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries more known.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, they simply wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Soon the first peaks made the rounds.
Some media called him "Robel der Wal".
The English Boulevard leaf "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, did not play a role there.
Compared to "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the course of Eric Moussambani was of media interest.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to arrive alone in an advance over 100 meters of freestyle.
Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at the time.
At the time, the 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

According to the police, the 67-year-old judge had left her business on Monday at 5.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When they returned the next morning at 8.15 p.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the box.
No traces of the perpetrator could be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump doesn't see the threatening election base so close.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a election event in Florida.
If it wasn't for the choice of the U.S. president, Donald Trump already has an alternative.
He'll just go on vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the U.S. presidential elections in November, it would be relatively no match for him: "At last it will either hit, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television channel CNBC.
If it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, then that's okay, Trump said.
He thus referred to US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the terrorist militia of the Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance developed.
Posts increase in trade with electric transporters
An electric vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the danger is apparently large.
The post plans to sell your streetScooter electric vehicle as well.
In short, the Group wants to start trading with the carrier.
The post wants to offer its electric transporters from next year also on the free car market.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether to sell its own developed StreetScooter, with letters and packages, also to other companies.
Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are always requests, such as by craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group will soon enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-manufacture, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and that in the long term, bullets would completely switch to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the whole fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on the streets of Germany since 2014.
GfK’s management dates from disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK replaces its chief Matthias Hartmann.
The retreats came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK has revealed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes more insecure, the longer the success he has promised.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After the disappointing business figures and the decline of business management, the world number Five of the industry is at the forefront of a new personal start.
GfK-Chief-Chief wants to leave the company by the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
As of 1 September, the Management Board was chaired by the former Board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company informed him.
He will officially take over the function of a "presiding speaker" until a successor has been found for Hartmann.
As a basis for the resignation, the company called "different views" to the long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to name a business speaker on Friday.
The future leader of the market research firm is still unclear.
In investment circles it was Friday that the shareholders had been disappointed at the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK point since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are yet to be seen after 5 years," it said.
In view of the latest bad GfK business figures, each shareholder will sometimes become restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quadts would do the same," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss in the previous quarter even in the second quarter of 2016.
With EUR 361.2 million, turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With regard to the first half of the year, turnover decreased by EUR 721.2 million by 3.4 per cent.
In the second quarter, the company’s low value was particularly heavy in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company depreciations of EUR 139 million that became necessary in the Consumer Experience business area provided the Group with a loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated another 19.7 million Group Profits.
Accidents - Bus takes place in Krummhörn in graves: Eight injured
In the event of an accident of a bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummörn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
The 66-year-old driver of a train bus from Eisenach had to avoid their information from an appropriate cargo which was driven partly on the counterroad.
The bus came right from the street and rushed into a tomb, as reported by a spokesperson of the Aurich/Wittmund police.
"Because of the bus situation, people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The firearm freed the insatisfaction.
Six rescue cars and a notary came to the crash site on the road 2.
The undamaged travelers were brought back from a line bus to the Krummhörn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators called on the cargo driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of wastewater shall be EUR 2.44 for the area of the wastewater treatment plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkall, as from 1 October 2016; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 for Zultenberg (so far EUR 2.26) and for Aszendorf 3,64 for Euro (so far EUR 2.18).
The installation in Azendorf will increase the waste water charge at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an overcalculation, the dewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
According to the report by Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU), when the budget was approved by the Landsratsamt Kulbach, it was found that there were undercovers for these sewage plants.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal bases, to operate the facilities cost-effectively.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens and businesses from Welschenkal, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take a deeper look into the money bag.
The rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a recalculation of the fees for the disposal facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period October 2016 to September 2020, coverings from the previous calculation period were also to be offset.
The gravity of the increase in fees was justified by Schmidt’s fact that all three water systems are relatively small facilities with a very low water impact, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, on the basis of the low distribution base, expenditure on necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the rise of water in all three plants has been slightly reduced.
Furthermore, in all three installations, the residual calculation period has not recently been significantly affected due to their age of repair and repair costs.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plant for Welschenkal, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the aquifer, Azendorf had to be replaced by mechanical ventilation due to damage.
In the Welschenkal pump plant, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overcrowded on ground and, after almost 20-year-old, Lopp had to be removed from the first sewage treatment plant, the sewage sludge was removed and an additional ventilation facility was installed to meet the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were taken into account in the continuing maintenance and maintenance costs to be taken into account during the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still clearly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhauser made it clear that in the case of the small spillage in the three plants, the costs for the operation and maintenance were "completely met".
In addition, Schmidt, the market community of large maintenance costs has been spared in the waste water plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for these plants will continue to be precarious, according to Steinhäusers, since it is not possible to extend the water supply area of Friesenbachtal, because these plants are defective.
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria accounted for 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, as positive 0.2% were recorded.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was measured according to the CPI -0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016 a price increase was observed in the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routines (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change the reality and play with identities in a way that already limits to absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be made from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unscrupulous, property-enhancing tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All failures have reached the public.
Snapchat filters in the past have drawn criticism in which they were accused of promoting the app Blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When this week some users proposed a filter that gave them slippers, false teeth and exposed waves, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "Yellow face".
They wondered whether these repeated disputes pointed to a bigger problem that the company had diversity.
The news and excitement were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters and not a cartoon by Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurting clichés.
Others rejected the animation comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Spapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely distributed over the photos, wrote that the filter was "injurious and flattered."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the counter-translation of a very resistant Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellowish face has been dragged to the depreciating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural barrier.
American culture seems to be in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's great audience of young people - who are different in race than their older opponents - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates a picture that is poignant to a user, "it's so much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.
In a press release and in a phone interview, she said she believed that racial disputes reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat's configuration practices.
Zhu criticized the white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Neither do they have different representations of people with other skin colors in their crew, so that they can make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or well-off to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that most Snapchat has left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff and refers to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to one speaker, the company recently set up a staff member, focusing on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said she was going to close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it's not OK."
Military management falsified ISIS secret service information, set by Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed news service information to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it had permitted the actual situation on site, a Congress's investigation committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, drawn up by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Military Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Defence Budget Committee, reports with great dissatisfaction among the Central Command Secret Service Analysts, who reported how their estimates of US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State were changed by the pre-laws.
The Central Command, in short, Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Reporting service information, which was typically degenerated by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the actual situation on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The conduction errors in Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government summits under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have seen themselves exposed to pressure from their precepts to paint a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were much more positive than they were in line with the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member of the public announced that a military recovery of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it is so clear," said Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the central team's peaks changed the news service reports to lower the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into their lives after they were played with the fact that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the surveys are continued.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the creation of news service estimates to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the high-ranking Democrat in the committee, a member of the Adam B. Ship Representative's House, announced in an opinion.
This process, according to Mr. Ship, "deprived the publication of news service reports", damaged morals among analysts and "gived too little room for divergent opinions."
But Mr Ship and the Democrats indicated that they had not found any evidence of a White House intervention with the Centcom analysts on a "certain political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congress' findings were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Inspector General of the Pentagon, recorded following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press spokesman for the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress's reports, while the Inspector General's findings were still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have had an impact on the issue of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence at the moment).
However, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic state recalls that more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece of paper about how the then government under George W. Bush opposed the recommendations of many analysts only provided for a small occupation group in Iraq and little time to consider the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current report on the Islamic state.
Last year, the team on Mr. Hooker stated by government authorities that contrary to the Government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the battles at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went to rest in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The USA wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain ahead
One day after she had shot three doors during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two doors for the American women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won with 3-0.
Five doors in two games should actually be a decent performance, but Bam (27) said they couldn't remember ever having done it.
"I have no idea." she said.
I'm not one of the people who keep their doors in memory.
However, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympics and are also in their group with the British in the first place that remains unbeatable after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two teams within their six teams will achieve the first and second seats each.
The first place will be the strong Dutch women a little longer off the road leading to the other group.
As well as the game on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising turnout through their success history, four years after they have landed at the last 12 places in London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time in three years had a hockey match in her hands (their two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), at the age of 16, she became the US national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the team.
Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to make things better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the work fund in London that we have now.
We can completely round the rudder.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the tower in the first half of the game with a back grip from the vicinity.
India had gone into the game without winning in the tournament, but the team proved to be surprising and held the level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and ran the ball into the door to provide a 2-0 leadership for the Americans.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final door in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutdown was the first of the entire tournament for the U.S. Torhüterin, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will it depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the Rag of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel persistently and unmistakably, a sharp gap between competition and pursuit.
It's like the Olympic fable itself would be a burning rod that's reached from the arm's to the swimmer to the tournament to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the waiting line at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and is a woman's hot with mushrooms, could have been just under these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he were a swimmer, tournament or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event at the same time.
Next to the center, partly in the shade are sports not generally recognized: air pistols, bows, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the breast-swimming and we can rule it for a long time.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampo jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so clear over the past 16 years that many I had asked did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline race and by 2012 had an athlete who managed it until the end.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain external charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humouristic potential - the cartoonic sitter of its never to end with the desire to catch up - but also the grace of the turn and dive, the two sports that combine it essentially.
The word "Trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "Spring Board."
Exciting winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet into the air and have to take a series of falling movements (turns, levers and jumps) before they land on the feet.
They will be evaluated according to the official Olympic programme after execution, difficulty level and flight time.
Biennial athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will meet in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is directly.
In their pursuit of gold, medal hopers must go further, faster, up and across, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
Not only are they chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but they also have another goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympics.
The goal is noble, wonderful, even fanatical - and it is enough to move even a viewer to tears.
But it is also what I feel as a bit boring when I watch these games myself.
Of which the trampoline offers a break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she washes away, seems as grave as an astronaut, goes up, then goes down, then tirelessly back up.
Here too there is competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no waves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.
The qualification and finalisation of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 East Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of a afternoon block on two days from 14 a.m.
In the middle of the Olympia Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the attack and objectiveization of male athletes - as the American male tournaments have recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his new community to call for air.
"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators who call for political change in Ethiopia are facing violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that there were dozens of protesters killed during the clash with the police during gunfights.
Is Ethiopia just about to break up?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests have shaken the country against the government and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was unmerciful.
Witnesses reported that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
The videos that are in circulation about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handle against a wall.
The head of the UN Office for Human Rights now requires an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa, and its stability is estimated from the west.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorism outside the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable rate.
His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new hanging suit in the capital of Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was all but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have repeatedly brought oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively brought to silence.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven into the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and do not have these other options to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protested.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use to the barrier of power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and are now controlling 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rose along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this vicious, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, who have been more or less forced in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of hinköchelns.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and improved Internet services.
Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate about Internet proxyes that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians claimed that they had gathered for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since then, the Amharas from Ethiopia have flourished in politics and the economy, while they exploit the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But that's just what's going on.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is infertilely dominated by members of the tiger ethnic group, which make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominated by the military, the secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-public illness in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly interested in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special mandates to edit and make opponents harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unbiased reasons to take Mr Meles' position.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the tiger.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to figures of analysts, seemed to have been misled and stolen by the government.
During the following raids, many protestors were killed, even though they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new hanging train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal maladministration of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, Protestants attacked businesses run by Tigray in Gondar, an Amharic city, and the hatred against the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the United States and other Western allies into a unique position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as the basis for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to collapse into an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin walk."
Donald Trump explains his claim that Obama founded ISIS was "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to destroy the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would not have been seriously meant by the "founder" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the presidential candidate of the Republicans, whether he was able to communicate with the American public in a clear and understandable manner.
It also brings his competitors, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, to have to explain in their own position statements that he could not have meant.
After making the adjudication at an election event on Wednesday, Mr. Trump withdrew with regard to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day, on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he thought the accusation was absolutely serious.
When the conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help slow down the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.
The last storm of criticism is pushing down Mr. Trump, while he is trying to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton spoke about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump again tried to return to this issue.
He reported on Twitter and warned that Mrs Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already submitted Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he took a strong criticism when he thought the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I meant the sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to move back to need.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then, where appropriate, to "clear" according to how the reaction goes." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of tightening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump has adopted an even louder tone as his polls have continued to decline.
A new survey of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the federal states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of misleading his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he was focusing his attention on the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes brought his loyal competitors into the uncomfortable situation to him, no matter how challenging his statements might be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, worked hard to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about Mr. Trump's statement of whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.
It is true in this sense that in front of Obama ISIS there was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbankers, totally wrong and that's why it happened because he took the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to expand by allowing them to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
In front of the elections in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and urged them to ride around on each of his words and to take action against him.
He prevented the "poor, ugly" TV experts who were trying to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats were laughing at Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was inappropriate for the presidency.
Once overpriced from the market, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shaky café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay for a bar that didn't have a Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, it was forced by the prices from its Bedford Avenue Chargefront.
The shop Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of Cupcakes.
Homely people felt it as the last loss in a gentiling city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is off and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is a change, then it's also a new one.
A reenacted Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old café, the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end of 2001.
When a customer offered him money for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of money.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bags bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with spices and cheese and there are garnishes such as capes and sauted mushrooms.
There are nature travel tables.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of ancient tribal customers.
"Many old customers were also driven by Williamsburg's prices," he said.
Recently on Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg earlier and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she was taken to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb had been closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was in the coffee and the culture in the verb that I felt," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though on that day she ordered a blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal is another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and he always ordered the same.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss bag watch and they prepared my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything-bagel with spices, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't have a role to play on the fact that the soap business took over the old business.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special coffee for Verb with the cold-frozen coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to get into her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the food card into Polish and Rodriguez said he intended to expose it soon so that his new neighbors would feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local softroom wants to fill and sell cold-frozen coffee into bottles.
There is a chance that the café expands to a neighbouring building.
For many customers a new verb is sufficient to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a patriarch and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the room and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt had a weak taste for refined delicacies of the Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was somewhat modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman told her book "97 Orchard" about living in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Your latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear on Tuesday in the Harper Publisher, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, narrow-minded imbiss in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the Börsencrash 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, Truthahn ate potatoes and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression.
"Rerich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There were strawberries, liver cheese and beans.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretched the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinste.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pasta was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" shows the ways in which the country was surrounded by no longer being the country.
"It was a time when food became a central, stressed topic for the Americans," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was also tense: mysterious foods such as bread and casseroles became basic foods to re-evaluate the casserole as "wonderful way to eat residues," noted Ziegelman, since kitchens could hide unspoilt ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the center of the American cuisine, became a rare luxury.
Typical blends were tested as a calories-rich and nutritional satisfaction had precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen understanding.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to lunch," Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Soil butter and baked mushrooms do not match each other.
It was typical of many of the household recipes.
As never before or since, economic operators - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - used the food habits of the country.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetary politicians" and to meet the challenge of turning champagne like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of the historical taste buds.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Cuch-Buchen-Buchten-Halking, are delicious.
While publicly celebrating the simple Iowa Farmhouse of his kitchen, he ate like the millions of heavy men from the world he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with gurkensauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost golden dining room and wore a cigarette.
He was a wonderful stranger.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the owner of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the fact that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting prepared."
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, to deal with food, were rejected as soon as the land came back to its feet.
The estate is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science has been applied to food.
The couple agreed to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid of the waste of food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "She really made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the counters were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe made a dessert they had prepared at home: the plumber, President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick to pass a modest recipe a good name.
There was no saffron, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and lime.
Each of them deliberately dived into the thick, brown gliber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a hit three times.
Like a can-do-budgeter, he said to his wife, "A couple of hacked walnuts would help."
Killed by a bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others' life.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a phase bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that had saved nearly 60,000 people's lives so far, according to image-sharing.
2900 Volunteers are putting their own lives at risk to drag people out of bombed houses and to give first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil protectionist showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the drummers of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrians a shining symbol in the grey of the war.
But as a hero he never saw himself, according to the image, he said: "For me, this is the true jihad."
"If I die saving life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Just before Omar himself was attacked by the victim, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four beam bombs over the Alzadia Bezirk, one filled with chlorgas.
A woman and two children die, seven people suffer from breathlessness.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb, so that children don't play with it," the picture quoted his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to meet terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest vertebrae is almost 400 years old
Rare view.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark returned to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims well 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks only grow with 150 years of age.
The Greenland hai swims along the ground of the North Atlantic, within an hour it reaches an average of 1.220 meters.
Only when it arrives, the five-metre-long animal speeds at 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a robot at this maximum speed.
But this slow lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenland hai who could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn", comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Even though the evolution biologists had long suspected that Greenland haie would be stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, and they live mainly in the iceberg in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the sixth degree Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland haie.
They measure their time tempo when they equipped six animals with a transmitter before peaks.
Even so, this shark is alive: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robot, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young ice bear.
Perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the basis of the iceberg and search for Cadverts that twist down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now investigating 28 Greenland haie, who brought fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as a starting point from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetres.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lenses of the shark using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is already formed before the birth of the shark, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had apparently a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tests increased the amount of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the 3rd smallest animal with 220 centimeters of length, the lentils included a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
On the other hand, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-144 hour showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeters long greenlandhai, while the record shark with 502 centimeters was supposed to be 392 years old.
The greenlandhai weaving was only known when they were more than four meters long.
Now the length researchers were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably on the threshold of the sex line and its age was set at 156 years old, Greenland Haie with the increase is apparently at least half a century old.
This should also be a world record for vertebrates.
The fact that such non-salems live mainly in demanding waters is not an accident.
Also the former record holder, a 211-year-old greenlandwal, in whose jaw a 120-year-old harpoon tip was on his neck, was caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on fire.
So they mature later - and older ones slower.
In order to stay warm in cold water, the animals are also often especially large.
For the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal heats up.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of an elephant.
Another advantage: you have less enemies.
"A smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having many offspring as soon as possible," explains evolution biologist Scheuerlein.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Building background in double pack
The municipality has dealt with issues about construction at the latest meeting.
With relief, the board took note of the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the newly identified residential areas can finally begin".
After clarification of the questions of land, parcelage and disposal and the applications could be submitted for measurement, the sale of the land in the residential areas of "straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße - Ext. 1) is no longer in the way of interest.
The municipality is convinced that the grounds in the rural and quiet residential municipality of Schönau address young families and Russian seniors alike.
As it was said, construction volunteers can report immediately to the Council, the municipality is expected to consult at its September session on the distribution of the parcels.
In order to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of other establishments linked to the creation of jobs, the municipality decided to amend the area use plan established in sub-areas only in the spring of this year.
In this way, in the area of undertime learning, the area already shown there is extended by two plots towards state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main then has the best chance to attract jobs and companies from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Brexit's vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the field of competence, Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the IW.
Following the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London to financial businesses across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they still have the approval in the UK.
That's what big U.S. banks are using.
Several banks have already announced moving jobs.
The lobbying association "Frankfurt Main Finance" will count with 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisor EIOPA and the ESRB.
Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The closeness to the bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg was home to a large fund sector, it was also more difficult to cut down on infrastructure like Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city has easy access to commercial property.
"It's not that easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris," Voigtland says.
In addition, the rents for first-class commercial property are 50 percent higher than in the main.
Furthermore, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition due to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's corporate advice, the city was in place seven, Luxembourg in place 19, Dublin in place 33 and Paris 37th place.
Even if quality of life is a question of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market, Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors," the IW follows.
However, despite Brexit's vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to economic researchers.
This is also true of the force ratio: in London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, there were about 14,000 people in the banking sector, in Frankfurt, 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. attorney decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has a claim for the reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it in the Hepatitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $200 million for the violation of two Merck patents related to the blockbuster medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US director discovered a pattern of misbehave on Merck, including mineid and other unethical actions.
At the hearing on Thursday, U.S. Attorney-General Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to bring with it Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained about each other and took ownership of laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead medicines.
U.S.-supported troops say they have regained full control of Manby from the Islamic state
Troops supported by the United States have regained full control of the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters left it in the city, a group speaker said on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are marching through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told the Manby Military Council of Reuters associated with the DKS.
"The city is now under full control, but we are running clean-up," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax statement for 2015 on Friday, this award for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clintons spent USD 1 million for charity purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton produced almost USD 5.3 million in Redehonoran; the former Foreign Minister gave income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her time in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, Senator Tim Caine from Virginia, has published his tax statements with his wife Anne Holton for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to set standards on financial transparency," said campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In sharp contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false statements and withdraws in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, even though they are not obliged by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They're on the train," Clinton's electoral assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter about the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax checks were completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 in the middle of Romney, have already allowed his refusal to raise questions about assets, his donations to charitable organisations, his business donors and various other connections, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already collapsed on the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday, in which the high-ranking Republican Trump calls for his tax statement to be published.
On Thursday she also spoke on the subject during a talk on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax statements."
Politico reported that Trump did not pay taxes for two years or only very little during the 1990s, and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election struggle.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffet that would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for buffets whose Berkshire Hathaway Industrial Conglomerate has its seat here to exchange Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffet said he had also been subjected to an IRS tax check and Trump had "anx" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has issued a tax statement since 2007.
The Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, on average paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax statement showed that only USD 100 of their income was paid, unlike most of all Americans.
Its main financial position was a cost-effective index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and profits of USD 109,000 were taxed.

Condoms with chili powder, Fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to keep elephants from going to human settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chili powders.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea of doing so years ago, has intensified its support with the U.S. Nature Protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent quadruple method to protect their houses and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many muscles have been used to defend themselves.
Friday is a world elephant day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed this ... toolkit, we have been able to observe within these communities a change in their attitude, while they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a fork and blowing in a horn.
If he's not scared, a so-called Chilean cloud will be thrown away.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a firework body into a condom whose end is turned to the furnace.
When it is lit, the condom puts up with a hook and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A hook is usually already out to chase the elephants.
A last possibility is a firearm that shoots a gold-fired plant into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
The City Council decides unanimously: No Kiosknebouau at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually, St. Goarer's investment projects by businessmen with a kusshand - however, the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly comprehensive.
However, the Council has now unanimously rejected the application for the new construction of a snowboard at the Rhine River in the immediate vicinity of the Rhinebalcone in the construction.
"We basically welcome new business operators, but at this location in an exposed position at the Rhinefer this kiosk does not fit," Michael Hubrath told the CDU Group.
Jewish director destroys Berliner Hotel, because Israeli preference was removed for "arabic" invitation - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots revealed a media riot after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not made an Israeli choice, since it had "demanded" Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah", released his concerns at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinks Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own Call Center.
After a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he got there was "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "intended decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotel."
The reason behind this was even more angry in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the choice be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great scandal", reports the South German newspaper.
We were upset and disturbed by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this has occurred in Germany exactly in this hotel chain is even a greater disgrace.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole scandal.
Some suggested to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "surrendered" the supposed demands of Arab guests.
"You are ashamed," said another contribution, pointing out that the hotel, which is located at the noble Kurfrestendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly showed all the accusations of itself and called the incident a "sweet" and "excused" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct order," Israel did not include in the quicklist," quoted the Süddeutsche Zeitung as a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that country preference has now been added.
Police use Tränengas & rubber boots against protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, students met in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police deployed tear gas and rubber shots against demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, leading to the police using rubber and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their abstinence over the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, some 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the Protestants saw graffitits spray on walls against the former President Michel Temer.
The recent protests agreed on a few days after demonstrators in masses went to the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate at her election.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the abolition of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagarianan, trade between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent per year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, interest in Russian companies’ websites in the country grew strongly, the ambassador said.
Russian companies take up existing links with Iran, while new companies are willing to provide access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagarian said.
He noted that trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent over the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade suspension was achieved by deliveries of machinery, agricultural vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagarian is dating from a record of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign delegation issued some 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries as regards the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken last year," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses sought: drink market in forest bröl
A robbery happened on Thursday evening at the drinking market of Rewe XXL at the forest bröler Gerberstraße.
Under a gun, three dark-dressed persons who had suspected their faces demanded the release of cash from the drunk market and then fled on foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
How much money has been spent, the police don't share.
The perpetrators should have been between 1,60 and 1,70 meters, i.e. relatively small.
The drink market is immediately accessible and poorly visible from the deck of the Reve market.
After the attack on Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Egelbert-road, the perpetrators must have fled from the parking lot opposite the parking lot with the silver-coloured car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the moment (at 7.45 p.m.) in connection with the robbery should report urgently to the police.
Nagold: Game and fun in the summer
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedagogical day group/social group work of the Child Protection Band Nagold with their followers on their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühlaker.
In the quiet holiday home Hardwaldle, the lively group was accommodated during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
For one thing, it went to Bretten with the visit of the striker zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special child guidance in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Celtenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group experienced much about the daily and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maulbronn, which included jumping, swimming and swimming.
Culinary children and nurses were decorated with their own prepared body foods such as the sour pätzle, the sea fountain pännle, the Iselhauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübinger Bolognase.
In workshops it was batted, made beautiful pieces of pearls and stones or made from wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were the fishing in a nearby pond, the evening at the fire and the final "Bunde evening".
On the day of the return trip, the sun and the children and young people were happy to return home.
Haigerloch: Pillars for the Forte of Mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch unit St. Anna were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villelingen to Freiburg.
Four steps have been taken together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Romwallahfart of all ministers in two likely years, the Prime Minister of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage goals were examined and finally decided for the Bishop of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage was offered to Freiburg.
16 Minims of prayer, coals, haigerloch and sanctuaries made their way.
On the evening before, Pope Storost sent the Pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims and granted them the Pilgrims.
From Horb, he was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where a monastery of Our Lady stands and thus the pilgrimage was attended by the monastery.
The individual daily tours were framed every morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way the minis made the field crosses, chapels or churches always rast to sing together a song of their own made-up pilgrim love.
For overnight stays, parishes of the local parishes were available.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
It continued on the second day about Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
At that time, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most intense route, had to be cut off at about 500 metres above ground heat and then collapsed again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the Badweiher at night.
After the morning impulse on the fourth Pilgrim Day in St. Peter's imposing monastery church, it went on the final stage to Freiburg.
The Minis met on the following afternoon on the Freiburger Münster and walked through the gates of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the Minis arrived at the Pilgrim's goal were welcomed by the co-operator Markus Obert.
After the service of God, the pilgrims were able to visit the priesthood and the high priest.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaum metropolis.
In the afternoon it went back by train to Horb.
Finally, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.
Shotte Callum Skinner storms home when British Gold hits for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner spent the last night in the Men's Team Sprint in Velodrom in Rio for fame, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old man from Glasgow took up the role of anchor who had made his countryman Sir Chris Hoy his own. The boy tip was proud of the legend when he stormed home to host a victory from the favorites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after they got only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Railway Championships in spite of Hoys' retreat.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the leader Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as Hindus.
Hoys still created a leak that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the shot that has now unfolded.
Hindus, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinners placed an Olympic chord in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand countries won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hinds was back shortly after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change in strategy made up a large part of the transformation in which Hinds went in a higher direction to slow him down and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Today looked at his position as BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindus when they came to the floor.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a nice comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
In the end we have set up an Olympic chord and won the world champions.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph of 2012 on Kenny's and Hoys' side, Hindes said that after a weak start he was deliberately on the train.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection from England's rivals.
In such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindus said, "It feels like all the GB flags on the Tribune like London."
We've been together as a team in the last three months.
We got away so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven of the 10 titles in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the Velodrom.
In the form of Kenny, it is possible that he repeats Hoys ’ victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would be for Kenny - who is just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (a apparently holy date for British sport; on that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a exploitation of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's coming from Hoy.
Kenny participates as next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go for three days.
The 28-year-old Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels something lonely to win alone.
Hindus said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doll qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at 3:51,942 at the target.
The world record that won 2012 in London Gold was at 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
He had argued with officials before the qualification yesterday when he was summoned by officials to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie advanced in world record time at 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the mid-term period of the Olympic Games and get a lot of medals.
After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domination in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas took place in the background, as the retreat of technical leader Shane Sutton in mid-April of sexualism and mobbing projects, as well as the rest of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks as if the now legendary call of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
Future of Portland merger due to the repeal of the energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminium meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby cancels all supply contracts, as reported by the supplying energy company.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, it could be a domino effect, as melting consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity production of Victorias.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzerie, which last year led to a closure of the English-sea power plant.
The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.
This step follows the years-long speculations about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium meltdown with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The facility is owned by a joint venture by Alcoa and Aluminia, the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through melting," the company said.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called "security business" that would have entered into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month deadline to end 2017.
"AGL therefore assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on AGL's revenues from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong time-markets for wholesale prices.
AGL reported that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion amounting to $187 million in "Achievement of Termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts, the "ability to operate Alcoas... the melting industry or to ensure the supply of electricity to the melting industry" was not affected.
The US company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that would have entered into force as of November this year, even if it was still guilty of a declaration of why it had withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts warn because of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Meltingerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In relation to the analyst's statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and around 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
If both installations were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as electricity producers," he said.
More than just a Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clan Kris is on the cover of the desired September issue of the U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and who attended the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the view of this cover brought me to wine," wrote Kendall.
The discovery of the cover followed a bizarre one (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), a scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except for the problems Rob and Caitlyn and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgot the cover of her sister and ended it with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché-like action almost every birthday episode of a children's broadcast (Seacrest brought the sentence, "Did you think we had forgotten you?", with the honesty of a comic strip on a radio at 8 a.m.), but Christ had to let her other girls share in this publicity somehow.
In view of the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim likes to have hit the Vogue cover (they and her husband Kanye West were watching it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September issue is for Vogue the most sold issue of the year.
With an extent that resembles a video tape more than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to fashionistas were from the 832 pages of the wall 615 pages of advertising).
The discovery of his coverstars is expected to ensure that in the last two years, images of the magazine are still secure before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "familiarities, models" than "familiar models" on the cover.
Oscar Prize winner and Dior Brand Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even with the little chance that Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as her generation's "throughbreak model" - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths from today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if anything happens to them).
They are really talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had published Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner's success is not for everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world has always been tense.
In June, the single Victoria's secret model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner, and her colleague Gigi Hadid, criticised her and called her "the misconceptions of the moment."
These feelings came back up when the message came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems to pass on the point of going around on the wrong path.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.
It is in the true sense of the word a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your founding of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Payall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure time she is watching in reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kurtney and their children.
Community law centres hold 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are rejected annually by the Community law centres, while the sector is concerned with the effects of further cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five persons - mostly older persons, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means for improper denouncing and similar - are already denied their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal resources.
The director of the Municipal Rights Centres of Queensland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Union of Municipal Rights Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the Federal Government's decision.
"Queensland's municipal law centres are chronically underfunded, meaning that thousands of people of important services you need will be rejected," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unbridled and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly discharged - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce the funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney-General and the Federal Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to remedy these cuts immediately, so that people can get the help they need in legal problems.
Last year, the Government committed itself to raising the national average for legal aid.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their customer communities and to see that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump Election campaign charged after the employee allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inactivity after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina had aimed a gun at an employee in February while they were in a jeep.
The case is described in an indictment filed by Vincent Bordini on Wednesday at Charlotte’s National Court, a former software programmer for the campaign in that federal state.
Bordini agreed to have waited months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that "it wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a gun, placed his right index finger on the lift, and framed the run in Vincent's knee," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The prosecution will only come two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he said to a number of people in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - firearms owners and friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and called judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had broken his words out of context and that he would not resort to violence.
Bordini's complaint calls for compensation from the campaign for the violation of the responsibilities of care and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press spokesman Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip was as bad as it was.
WCCB, a local messenger in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
His consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, did not respond.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The proceedings are based on Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: survey before country elections: lose SPD and CDU
In the upcoming elections in the Federal Countries Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU are recorded.
These were representative surveys by the INSA Opinion Research Institute for the "Image" edition (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could hardly continue to govern, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance to continue to put the government head.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party is only close to the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is between the left and the AfD.
The left comes to 19 percent (before 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the countryside.
Despite slight losses of 6 percent (before 8.7%), the greens went back to the Heavy Land Day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 per cent each in the countryside.
According to the Berlin parliamentary elections, the SPD survey is only 23 per cent (election 2011: 28.3 per cent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They are still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Representatives by 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entry in 2011 instead.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in time: 20 years ago the Nokia communicator came to the market.
The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clever.
The built-in memory was at the beginning of eight megabytes, which would be about two selfies with high resolution today.
An iPhone is currently delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 communicator" arrived in business on August 15, 1996, exactly 20 years ago - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can buy the devices on the Internet, but they come somehow from the stone age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as "office in the West Bank format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of text and e-mails for then standards, even by fax the communicator was able to reach.
Even access to websites was possible through HTML browsers, even though it was very slow.
A wallet was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a little antenna, and the phone could be tapped like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. around 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one knew in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.
The phone section of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and sold to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers who came all much later than Nokia.
Always be online and everywhere, this is today for many people every day.
In 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion devices were sold, including 555 million pieces on Samsung and Apple alone.
Worldwide sales of the equipment are estimated to be around €400 billion.
In addition, the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications groups.
Around the smartphone is now created a whole industry.
The major breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, to easily operate everything via touch screen.
Apple's victory started, and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the prospect.
They're finally gone. Blackberry's got to fight.
The words now have Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung.
The smartphone is a self-understanding 20 years after its invention.
On average, today every German looks at his phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away once too," said Janina Kugel, in Siemens's staff board.
Permanent availability is now considered as curse and blessing at the same time.
England needs to link the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring not only renewal and prosperity in our local municipalities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction Heathrows, as it was in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we alone will create 10,000 new schools, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport.
As they were before us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement Heathrows is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong 2012 and they will also lie with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for each.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, to create £211 billion of scientific growth and to leave a wealth of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - the five years in succession to the world's best airport terminal, until T2, which was built between the world's two most frequent runs.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's enlargement will also be one.
It is time to link this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow and secure our future trade and create a wealth of skills and employment that can be proud of England.
Lord Paul Deighton is president of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Katz- und Mousespiel" about Adblocking
For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent advertising blocks, a "cat and mouse game" are the same.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ads on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network again.
On Tuesday Facebook told us that his desktop would change the encoding of his ads to make it difficult to detect what part of the advertising page is.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to circumvent the new codes.
In a blog post, the spokesperson of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-her-fight between the visible open source community and the environment has already been in progress since the invention of the target blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indicator of how the industry has become an alarming target blocker.
According to a last year study by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people are using advertising blockers worldwide; almost four times in 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users every day accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company has looked at display blockers on Desktop PCs as mobile display blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker said.
Advertising on Desktop PCs makes enough of the revenue, so Facebook appears to invest such a step as a reward.
On Tuesday Facebook told us that it would update its "ad preferences tool" to increase people's control over advertising targeted at them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be concerned about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
"For users this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook speaker told an e-mail message.
Advertising blockers are a stupid means, so instead we have focused on developers tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control into the hands of people.
If a woman commits suicide on a Swiss motorway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a motorway in the early hours of the morning on Thursday at a suspected suicide of several vehicles.
The event took place on the A1 near Morges in Canton Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman lay in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were met by several cars, the police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been spotted, but some have still not been identified, the police said that they and every witness of the incident are invited to report.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation," Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be expected that one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which a person in the dark was on the motorway - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was walking in the middle of the night on the motorway, as was said in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was released after she had passed over and killed a man who was on the A1 one night in August 2014 near Payerner.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the police -- who had responded to an emergency -- drove in a justifiable way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "very extraordinary and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
The Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the history of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have demonstrated similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and yet slowly progressed.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid poisoning.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun of 30 percent.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as a rain screen to protect the surface from a large part of the sun’s heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than those of the earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that is similar to the evolution that was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although at one time it was likely habitable, Venus -- over the course of billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans were flooded and their water vapor was burned off by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogens were developed, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect was left behind -- the Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letter.
Patrick Roy retires as coach of Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and introduced too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will be looking for a new coach immediately.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
In the course of the summer, I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, which it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned to those of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who was nominated by Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patric informed me of this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14, Roy was awarded the best coach of the League as the winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was hit in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the after-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches listed a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and dropped behind the wild for a second Wildcard spot at the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, strike off
The work struggles with regard to the remuneration of North Sea workers are suspended, while all the parties to the dispute are putting themselves on the table for a new round of discussions, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil service provider Wood Group were sporadicly carried out on platforms in the North Sea that are operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unit and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the settlement process of the current conflict," it says in a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the coming weeks, which will begin next year to address the problems again.
The trade unions said that their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year has reduced its rates to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The rate reduction of the company follows a 10-percent decrease for Onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the space needed to get through the market fluctuation.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to end its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries, as it rationalises its business as a result of its mega-connection with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower crude oil prices, an economic situation which had increased by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
The Scottish Member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with workers at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that has taken place since one generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016 less than $1.4 billion of expenditure for new projects in the North Sea is expected on average about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star range of the Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates under the stars of the constellation of the Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the constellations and in what context the rotation times are associated with the rise of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star base of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, which were created about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're turning as fast as they can.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like solar beams.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars of slow pirouettes turning smaller.
"In the Ballet of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, where faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebul said.
Since the star ranks of the Pleiades are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare star qualities such as rotation rates.
"The star heads of the Pleiades offer an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebul said.
There is still much we want to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational rates and so to speak, hang their dance shoes.
In three newspaper reports, Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star has fallen
The tears flowed faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US Baseball star in the best days of base.
After his emotional withdrawal announcement, the 41-year-old Profi will be wearing the New York Yankees Tampa Bay Rays' shirt for the last time on August 12th.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time All-Star Game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Trimal was chosen Rodriguez as the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has protected him for 27 million dollars a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 it will function as a consultant and youth coach - at full capacity.
As a player it paid Rodriguez back long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004), and since 2005 Yankees created some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players in the most important statistics show similar values.
However, the 41-year-olds should not be admitted to the Baseball Hall.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - top name "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
Already in 2009, the Superstar allowed "ESPN" to take steroids prohibited between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, it was blocked for 211 parties due to a development in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received a powerful funding through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida for years.
After a legal dispute, the gap was further reduced to 162 meetings.
"The League might even have liked me for 2014 because I spent 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said at the time.
His days of separation also do not go unnoticed.
While many baseball legends in their last games again received the big stage, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include a divorce tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," said Yankee Coach Joe Girardi.
Meanwhile, Rodriguez, who was married to the actor Cameron Diaz, and the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actor Kate Hudson, got told about the sympathy of the fans of the Yankee Erzrivalen Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the supporters sang at 4:9 a.m. against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Acquired: Due to a positive doping sample, weightmaker Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overrated by the first official doping cases.
A successful athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh day of the race, the first official Doping Cases were known to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silvia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightmaker Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the critical athletics competitions, these messages come untimely.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Court of Sport CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-olds held the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterling, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen would have participated in the pre-trials over 50 m of freestyle.
Chen requested the opening of the B test and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen full cooperation in the investigations", Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Sport CAS and accept the judgment".
For the first time in history, IOC is no longer responsible for punishing athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of the positive test at Danekowa assured him that the 33-year-old himself went to the offensive.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," explained the light athlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is to be used for the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT the B test should have already been positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissow immediately reported criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said. "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, for example, all weights from the chronic doping nation must not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days earlier positive on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both contest the intake, however, they must not start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the launch of the light athletes, the Danekowa case is especially a major blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF World Association had banned the start of the entire Russian team until an exception due to systematic doping, and the Kenyan running nation also produced many bad news in Rio.
In the swimming sport, the previous events in China also provided for fierce clashes between athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic Sun Yang Harsch.
"The Son of the Pink One."
"If I see the podium over 200 m of freestyle, I want to give up," said Lacourt on the French radio.
The Sun was also at the centre of an argument with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time or respect for doping fraud," he said.
In 2014, the Sun was positively tested for the Stimulant Trimetasidin in the Chinese championships, but only a three-month suspension had to be removed.
Data Key: So Perfectly Express Hacker Your Remuneration
Developers of Impressive Malware are currently attacking targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by the Malware Defense Specialists under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed were at least once in the last 12 months, partly multiple victims of an attack with pressure software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already target for ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims volunteered to pay the compensation required by the victims in order to be able to reuse the systems and data they were attacked.
The perpetrators specialize in their pressurised software according to the observations of malware bytes in view of attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially oppressing solution is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a frightening fast evolution of the damage software," Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski explains in a conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered compression software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the change to firm attacks took place quickly in the past few months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it looks for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files as well as files of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals permanently.
The software then presents the demands of the oppressors.
To get the encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the bitcoin crypto currency.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is stopped.
Therefore, the damage is higher when a ransomware is awarded.
22% of the affected German companies reported loss of sales by ransomware, 13% even had to interrupt business completely, in one case people were at risk for life.
In Germany, several hospital victims have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be seriously threatened by the loss of hospital records.
"We always say to the victim: don't count, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For the manager it is difficult to refuse the request of the perpetrators, given the state of the operation.
The hackers know that again and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, security researchers from F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and the contact with the oppressors and have found the result: In fact, the perpetrators are trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims by chat, how they can pay by bitcoin, freely access support websites to or decrypt example files.
And after payments of a few hundred euros, private people will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware oppression, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building box to the actual oppressors.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"Contained in delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The oppressors are then looking for further hackers to distribute the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the forums underground, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment shall be made per infected computer.
"The criminals usually order spammer with distribution," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on ransomware to resist using file-backups and scanner software.
Consequently, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, according to the type of data, the potential of damage is still a multiple higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take up entirely new targets on the Internet of things.
Security researchers demonstrated at the Defcon Hacker Conference how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the release of such blocked heating could be worth a ransom to some victims.
If, instead of heating in the future, the perpetrators block a whole manufacturing street in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in industry 4.0.
One for All Cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little cupé and also the diversity of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually turns out to be highly flexible every day.
Although only 1.60 m high HR-V has a smaller effect, passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the fund, it does not work at all.
The materials in the interior are well-processed and work pleasantly, only the cockpit surface falls slightly.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles at the warehouse.
There is not only a 453 l case room available at high and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the backbank can be lifted up like a cinematose and thus offer a storage room, which is from the ground to the ceiling of 1.24 m high.
The luggage room can be loaded well, however, the height of the load is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large ranges.
However, he would have to do his work a little quieter.
Happy is the daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l benzene with 96 kW/130 PS.
An all-round drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be something more direct.
The equipment does not allow the "Executive" option to be opened in the tested top.
The security systems include the City Emergency Brake Assistant (working up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the tracking assistant.
The collision alerter sometimes irritates because he rated many obstacles as "necessary objects".
Very reliable the remote light assistant works.
And the intelligent tempo rule reacts to traffic sign recognition and threatens speed if needed.
But full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7 inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and an HDMI box are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat reachable.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro-6 abgas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and day-to-day car.
Airline not in charge: crash on the flight deck
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the flight deck.
Because a liability can only be considered in the case of hazards which are typical of air traffic, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a nail in the crash.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it is a general risk of life, as the Court said.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
Sickness: When does the event pay?
After their trip, sick holidayers will only get money back when the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
But this is only when more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was seriously ill on the second day of her Turkish leave.
She spent almost all her vacation in the room.
Their disease led the vacationers back to a defective clearing plant that allegedly had polluted the sea.
The family was the view that the trip was not enough - and complained against the organizers.
The plaintiffs had no success before the court.
Even the clearance system was actually defective.
However, the event was just before the plaintiffs left.
He had to make sure the sea was okay until then.
So he didn't violate his information obligations, so the judgment.
There were no impurities found in the water samples.
The illness of several hotel guests - perhaps by burning each other - is part of the general risk of life.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were sick.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state had to isolate itself and firmly respond to terrorist threats at the same time.
Surely our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We won't give this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals were to leave the country faster, however, this would increase security and also strengthen the people's consent to refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced another personal reinforcement of the security forces, "in the middle quadrilateral order over several years".
Counterfeiting for terrorism had to be punishable again.
Video surveillance is intended to improve, the right to arms is so renewed that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is particularly difficult.
The last much discussed obligation for doctors is to remain in line with the words of the Maizière.
However, in the dialogue with the medical community, he wanted to look for solutions to reduce the danger of the citizens, he said, for example, with regard to mental disorders.
In order to combat radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
To prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (darknet), de Maiziière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has made himself clear against activism.
"That was an earring for the sharpmaker in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
A general ban on full disclosure is considered to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
It is possible to speak about rules such as in road transport or for witnesses before the court.
Green Chief Simone Peter proposed to the Minister that he always want to simulate action-power and ability with new anti-terrorism packages.
Left-Party Bernd Riexinger said: "Float language and a tightening of the right of residence will no longer bring security to people in this country".
Better traffic flow on the motorway carrier
It is regularly located on the surrounding street - here is a picture of November.
But this is to change: the legal basis is to be extended.
This is good news for all drivers who are on the road to work every evening when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (August 16-17th), the road construction in the area between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße will extend the legal trail by 700 metres.
Car drivers can then directly slide right from the Hammer Street.
The great advantage: Transport is being split up early, thereby improving the whole of it in the multifaceted section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group represented Münster-West in the district.
The driver is particularly nervous on the driver between 17 and 19 hours.
Workdays are enough to back up to the bridge over the Alberslöher road and sometimes beyond.
The needle hole is located on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Weseler Straße.
From this point on, the traffic is driven only through the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt about a quarter of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary carrying power to take up the heavy load transport in particular.
As long as this narrow pass and the associated daily stack will last, the competent country operator cannot say.
However, it is to be expected for years: because the bridge has an official use period until 2034.
For the extension of the legal loophole, the country's company has deliberately chosen the weaker time in school life because it has to be calculated with disabilities.
Transport is carried out on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school visited the theatre "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the young theater are now planning a music project.
Nima's association allows young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a performance of the award-winning "The Invisible House" of the Boy Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Trip" initiated by Nima's, 19 students between the ages of eleven and 15 visited the scene in the Little House.
Since the beginning of the year, the Association, which has set itself the goal of the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scene pictures and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action, however, according to the press release of the Young Theatre Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprale, and the young theatre will be working together in the coming playing time as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migration backgrounds between 14 and 20 years of age will be able to attend professionally organized courses in the fields of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association counts with many classes who want to participate.
Rain instead of stars: Hope for better weather
The weather has made the star nuggets in southwest Germany a line through the bill on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The night was bad for clouds and rains to watch the sky show, said the president of the Star Warte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies on the night of Saturday.
The weather's supposed to be good, then we're definitely seeing a lot of stars in the sky.
The star cobblestones are Persians, which are among the fastest star cobblestones with 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their names because they appear to come from the constellation Persian, which rises in the northeast.
Restless Night: Tips against Sleeping Disorders
You walk around forever in the evening, you stay up for hours at night, you can't think of sleeping long before the wake-up bell.
That's all but relaxing.
You are always in good company with such problems: According to Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there may be various causes for them, Hans-Günter Weeß, a member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand underground is but insomnia, i.e. an insomnia and sleep disorder.
Just as many people feel that sleeping is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of directors in the German House Doctor's Association with Practice in Lower Saxony.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind this, organic, mental or behavioral factors can be applied, but also medications.
Sleep disorder is not uncommonly an expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is especially common in depression," says Weeß.
And it can be that different factors are connected.
For example, one who has a bad record, who can lie down, wakes up every two to three hours, and perhaps begins to grips with everyday problems and concerns, gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
Since when should you take sleep disorders to your doctor?
Anyone who does not sleep well for at least three nights a week over a period of one month and is affected by the day should go to the doctor, advises the doctor.
The impact may seem quite different: you are tired, tired, sleepless, have difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily emotional, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.
To alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There is hardly a retired sleep doctor in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep health center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, you should first contact the doctor for sleep problems, advise knew.
It can determine by means of investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the bedroom, and what's going on?
For sleep lab research, physicians advise, for example, for snorkels with breath-exposurers, for sickly daily fatigue, for sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't sleep for lunch," Fietze says.
After the wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
Alongside the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the roof records the sleeping persons.
How can those affected get the problems into the grip?
There are quite many job screws where you can use them for a better sleep.
We know: Regular sleeping and upsitting times, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not sleeping on television, avoiding alcohol and not watching at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and that is not quite encouraging.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Debilr spoke on Facebook about the disappointing cutting of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he first won gold at the Doha Short-Rail World Championships and at the same time won his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Debilr has been protecting himself from his former teammates who are critical.
"In a country where an Olympic winner receives a €20,000 prize and a jungle king €150,000, no one should wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The promotion system in swimming sport is bad, on the other hand, doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not look exactly at the subject of doping or even operate it.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be set here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Debilr had to have been notified nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's exactly how you should keep it with countries.
"Whoever cannot be controlled by WADA/FINA independent controllers for a certain time before WM/OS must not participate," asks the Hamburger who is currently operating an ice-cream.
Airport: Band of luggage depth arrested
Professional thief at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, civilians from Düsseldorf Police managed to arrest two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61.
As a band, the suspects had run several pockets and luggage thefts.
At 9:30 p.m., civil officials in Düsseldorf Airport again recognized a band that was known to policemen from previous thefts.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and had been engaged in community-based, labour-intensive and particularly professional activities.
The Specialists of the Criminal Commission 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who were specifically involved in criminal proceedings against Germany.
In total, they had spent more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a couple of Linden trees, by the way, still another headstone patch: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at first sight, but the police are among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you go from east to west, you get to playgrounds, a freshly striped kindergarten and a biostore.
On the facade of a gray house, someone has sprayed "horrible!".
Against a member who will soon be destroyed, it is already being built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created.
However, articles about this "trendous district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain is called, are preferred to be represented in the last few weeks by burning cars.
The reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, by now the inhabitants have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and used for events.
In particular, the Berlin Insensor Henkel had spoken several times since the beginning of the year for a hard police action against the project, the area as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On 22 June, after the premises on the ground floor, which had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police patrolled for three weeks according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three on-site crew cars, blocked parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with number 94.
During this time, the premises were renovated by construction workers on behalf of the unknown houseowners.
On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the room was illegal and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the jubilee of sympathizers and residents.
This summer's afternoon the road works peacefully: parents go walk with children, people sit on the street in front of the houses in the sun, others sit in front of Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neubauer, who has been living in Kiev since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are especially generous by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the care of rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a pickup that mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing links.
The tomb opened by the Berlin Home Senator and the police between homeowners and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working district, which has a low average income and a high risk of poverty today compared to the rest of the city.
Houses and housing projects have also been part of Kiez for a long time: in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near the Riga.
While the mainsmen were hiding under a large police offer in a regular street fight, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still partially inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years the district has become increasingly the magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them residents from DDR times and former homeowners share their kiez.
This is also evident in the rentals, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized on inserted discs or freshly cut facades that have been painted with colour labels.
No other street was mentioned this year so often with the words "left autonic violence".
One reason why not all neighbors see it as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as physical injury are almost exclusively directed at policemen.
Most of the crimes constitute damage to the case, which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neubauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
As for rape, it is discouraging: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, who have certainly not been.
There are also the famous burning cars in Riga no longer directly.
For the studied architect her road is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help one another, live together on the road and get more of each other with than elsewhere".
The new builder was deliberately dragged into the Riga street - and remained.
That's why it was so important for the residents to get back to their streets: from the police, politics and the media, who all of a sudden claimed the highest point of view in July.
But in the eyes of people like new-builders, the road continues to take them away: through faceless new-buildings in former buildings that push the old inhabitants away.
"These are finally property apartments that are not interesting to many here - people who are not so well-off here," she says.
"I can't say no to violence and destruction."
But what should you do if you never listen to someone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.
Kerstin Neubauer has little understanding for those who are angry about color mines: The house projects and the left scene were part of the Kies.
Anyone who withdraws should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a kneipen district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Boschle is the contact partner in matters of integration and organisation.
She is also a social worker on site.
Since July, Annika Deuschle is the refugee officer for Urbach.
The Social Education team supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
It is seen as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group Refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine customer from the working circle suggests that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Boschle is now there, the egg-bearing wolf milk sauce, which has a problem in particular.
Thus, some - less mockingly than rather on the number of tasks required - felt that the administration wanted to write down the place.
An administrative force was sought with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in social work, just an egg-sucking wolf milk.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuchle.
Above all, it is about organization, work with people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She's been holding a 50 percent stake for three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regina Kunde, that Annika Boschle supports honorary and senior actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers will soon be in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been to find apartments for the refugees who have been recognized for some time.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.
The costs of building, renting or refurbishing these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Land Council to municipalities and employment centres.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work until now, you've been assigned to private apartments, Deuschel.
So, what it means to be so beautiful is that there is a need for communal apartments to be vacated.
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But it's not done with apartments.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuchle agree.
In addition to a firm stay, there are workshops, training centres, schools, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," says Regina customer.
Many work in the Bauhof or help housekeepers, do useless work - and that is motivated and very well reported by Annika Boschle.
She hopes that the work for the common organisation of the market will have a positive external effect.
That's not "employment therapy".
But activity does not mean just work.
The day needs a solid structure, says Boschle and customer.
People had to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with natives and especially language courses.
Professional courses are weird.
So there are also administrations and dignitaries.
It is crucial that refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it is just taking place and that they can make sense of the time, for example with language courses.
Whoever ever develops the feeling, he can't help anyone in Urbach, he can't work and be useless, he'll never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are also problems, says customer honestly, "People with nothing to do with." Therefore, the work of Boschle and Customer is always to motivate others.
That's all a mother's job.
A difficult question: are the two of them afraid of radicalization after the latest occurrences, even in a small town like Urbach?
"No," says Regina customer quite clearly, "what some may call naive." A risk can and will not exclude it.
Sensitized, however, the helpers are already.
These events were also a topic for refugees.
They were afraid that the assassins would bring them to trial.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regina customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, the main and honourable officials must keep an eye on activities on the ground and in the region.
They are always in the background that a new attack on refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is at stake.
In fact, it is unfair to place them on site.
"We haven't come to Urbach where we can go," says Annika Deuchle.
No new refugees would relax.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already out of the question of the rational integration of the people.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schordorf: Breakers with helicopter search
The police raider flew off for about an hour in various areas.
Two unknown men entered an apartment in a multifamily house in the Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8.50 a.m.
The resident surprised them both and struck the uninhabited into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, well masked, both wearing bluejeans and black capuzen pullis.
They ran downtown.
The police arrested several strip crews and a police scrapper.
The conquest was unsuccessful.
The strangers may have fallen before the fact near the apartment or at their escape.
Baden-Württemberg: Police identified after the Rocker attack on Imbiss
After an attack on an Ulmer Imbis, the police find six suspects from the Rocker environment because of a serious land peace break.
In the case of housing investigations, evidence and cause of death were provided, the police informed them on Friday.
About 20 masked men of a rock-like group had, according to police in July, thrown bottles and stones against the sheepfold of an immise.
Then they should attack two guests and have injured one easily.
Then they run away.
The Imbiss and the adjacent building caused a damage of 10,000 euros.
According to the investigators, there is a dispute in the Ulmer Rocker environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish walk.
Thuringia: Zeiss Meditec of the Milliards of Commerce
