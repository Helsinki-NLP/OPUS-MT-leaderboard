Joseph Witko’s father: I saw Jesus in a white chair
It's charysmatic.
To the Masses of the Saints sent by him to free and heal the crowds.
He was only a few years old when things started to go unexplained in his life.
Today, through Franciscans, others experience it.
On behalf of O. Wikko, the Mass of Saints to Free and Healing brings the crowds
The parents of a 7-month-old child once came to him who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.
It was supposed to have been operated.
Joseph Witko’s father prayed about him.
On the same day, the boy was sent to the hospital for surgery.
Surprised doctors said: "The operation is not necessary, the remains are only 1.5 mm".
My parents were crying for luck.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The Creator’s outstanding spiritual activity has begun to experience as a teenager.
In a dream, a pure soul came to him asking for help.
I was raised in the night and urged to pray for the dead and for those who died at that time – a memorial.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what would happen to a man who would commit a mortal sin.
"My body began to change.
I've lost human characteristics and started to pick up the animal's look," he says.
The invisible force took him up, couldn't get his voice out of him.
He felt he was lost.
Then God gave him salvation.
"I was released and returned to human form in the waters of the river symbolizing the Christmas," he says.
He didn't tell anyone about those strange experiences.
There was a call in him.
He was 16 when he joined the French.
In his sermons, he not only wanted to tell about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community Reunion in the Holy Spirit
A lot of people who count on getting rid of the disease are taking part in the health care machines sent by Father Witko.
However, the spiritual one emphasizes that their primary objective is spiritual healing, not physical healing.
First defeat of Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26th) on the afternoon of the Kolpinga FRAC team, the award was awarded to the current Polish champion Dartom Bogorija Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd train of the LOTTO Superligi Tennis Table.
Charoslaving in such a personal set, as presented with the gardeners, has no chance of winning with the League's sovereigns.
He showed this one with Dart Bogoria.
The team is still missing, called the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the charoslaving composition they would reach third of the triumph line in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han probably has not yet grown up to win with such tusks as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Mark Badowsky.
The champion from Hellady was the largest single star in the MOSIR Hall at Sikorski Street in Jarosław.
Both old Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were a class for themselves.
After three singles Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably played Mark Badowski, and Daniel Goroak after the exciting five-year battle – Paul Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
You could still have hoped for a win in two points, but Qiyao Han didn't succeed Badowski.
There will be no further studies for seniors.
Why?
According to Raphal Trazaskowski, a free prevention programme for seniors 70 and 80 years of age was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be put into effect because it has not been accepted by the Ministry of Health and is subject to it by the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Classification.
For reasons, the Agency explained that the target group was badly selected.
"These actions can have a significant impact on the detectability of individual disease units, which may contribute to deepening the difficulty of accessing NFZ services and have a negative impact on the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive results of studies", wrote.
The board's decision doesn't make sense to the president of the capital.
"The money is ours, we predict it.
Only the government is afraid that if people are examined, they will then go to a doctor, which is absurd, because it is just to lead to a situation where prevention can be performed faster.
All experts know that this helps when it comes to the burden of the health system because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in the correct approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafael Trazaskowski.
"I find it hard to imagine that the current specialists are saying, "Let's not go to the doctor's office because there will be longer courses, and if these specialists advise the government, I'm not surprised that there's a health service in this situation," said PO.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at the UN General Assembly that any agreements concluded with Israel would be broken if the future government of that country tried to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu's declaration of annexation to the occupied Palestinian territories.
"If the government of Israel will come to realize this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all the commitments made," he said.
"We reject the whole plan completely and completely," he threatened with pressure from Abbas.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights with all possible measures – little what they will be – by fully engaging in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Autonomy, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanjahu, now Israel's Prime Minister, again received a government formation mission after the elections of 17 September.
One week before the elections, he said that if they were won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and will include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank.
In the early 1990 ’ s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Jaser Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements that were sponsored by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during the UN General Assembly session to hold the Palestinian elections on the ground.
The last one was in 2006.
"After returning to the country, I called on the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem local elections and all those who would oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian President declared.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, which was treated as a permanent observer in the United Nations, to use the powers of "full-fledged members of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions".
The Palestinian leader concluded his call to the international community to "enforce Israel to comply fully with the provisions of the United Nations".
Ambassador of Israel Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "desires to focus in the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Autonomy directed against Israel rather than to fight against the calls for terrorism in Autonomy under its leadership".
However, Danon, as the agencies say, did not refer to Netanjahu's annexes to the occupied Palestinian lands.
The saviors want defibrillators at the neurologic points of the Mind
The history of the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save human life.
The voivodship of the Ratunk Cooking Station in Industry wants such devices to be found at the city's nerve points.
According to their position, the officials received congratulations from the Vojevodz Station of Ratunking in Industry.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Výjcicik are officials of the Undercarpeck Office of Treasure Customs in Industry.
On 28 August, they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medica. The Customs-Scarb Service official noticed a man lying unconscious in the pedestrian traffic zone.
The Chinese activist died in prison for torture.
He wanted to take advantage of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
Cao Shuxia, an activist's wife, called on 23 September a Communist Party secretary from her family village to inform her that her husband had just died at the military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death – he did not reveal it.
In Cao's bones, she saw a man's body slaughtered, not for recognition.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in the blood," says the woman.
"They didn't let me take the phones with them, and there were a lot of cops around who couldn't get close to Wang."
The police insisted that she sign a statement that her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of an "unfortunate accident".
105 million zł for companies from the video game industry from the National Research and Development Centre
Nearly 105 million zł co-financing comes to gaming companies that create innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Centre announced on Friday the outcome of the third edition of the GameINN programme.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by NCBR were the development of a platform for the creation of field games based on the AR engine creating a real world map along with an application that allows users to transmit data; a testing and training platform to verify practical skills at work and professional excellence using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating real production processes using an innovative game model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of industry 4.0 – the NCBR communication sent to the PAP on Friday.
The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry on the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, today the Polish video game sector is growing at 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to 1.85 billion zł and the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
"The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and already reaching €300 million support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme are an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of the Polish game," we read in the Communication.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
"The government's incentives for innovative entrepreneurs, such as B+R benefits, excellence programmes, IP box or support programmes implemented by the NCB, encourage innovative companies and allow them to compete more effectively on a highly competitive market," the vice-premier, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication.
The head of the Science Resort notes that money for innovation not only reaches innovators in the form of project funding, but also remains in their pockets – thanks to B+R in 2018, three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited than a year ago.
‘The estimated cost of the B+R activity was 1,7 billion zł, which provided more than 300 million zł savings for companies benefiting from this benefit.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCB in the three editions of GameINN," the vice-premier points out.
The Director of NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kamieniečki also recalls that in the two previous pre-financing tenders with a total value of over 211.2 million zł was awarded to 78 innovative projects.
The huge interest in competition III and the variety of applications submitted show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and enhance its competitive advantages.
"It is particularly pleased that among the projects identified, as in previous editions, there are projects on solutions that serve not only entertainment but also industry 4.0," he adds.
In the third GameINN competition for funding of up to €20 million, entrepreneurs, business consortia and business consortia with scientific units could apply.
The NCBR has affected 87 applications for the total amount of approximately 317 million zł.
The tender budget at the time of the call for tender was 100 million zł, but it was increased, thus giving 27 projects almost 105 million zł of funding.
Detailed information on the results of GameINN competition III is available on ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN Sector Programme is implemented under the Intelligent Operational Development Programme.
NCBR launched a programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of business partners in the Polish Game Agreement, which includes, among other things, companies such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga admitted to stealing Kaspera Dolberg's watch
The event took place on 16 September.
Dolberg, who was from Ajaksa Amsterdam to Nice in late August, took notice after training that his watch had disappeared from the closet.
It wasn't because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The next day, the angry Danish didn't show up in practice, translating into stomach problems.
The matter was a mystery from the beginning.
The pools in the barn have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP, he finally admitted to stealing Diaby-Fadig.
He already apologized to Dolberg and other colleagues from the team and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised Denmark to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising players of a young generation in France.
He went to Nice as a 13th century to get a debut three years later in the first team.
He's been performing in seven matches this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as L'Equipe reported, the club is likely to dissolve it with immediate effect.
At the moment, he started disciplinary proceedings against his professional.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well
We all know they need to be washed (e.g. after coming home or before dinner).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of the infections, we need to do it properly.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds for the wash to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
And most of us wash them short!
Enough warm water and ordinary soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors are hand-advised).
We wash not only the undersides and the uppers of our hands, but also: the ends of our fingers (joined or individually) – cut them with the clumps of the inside of the other hand, the space between our fingers (repayment of the hands, touching the fingers of our hands), the fingers – each finger we embrace with the other hand, and in such an embrace we turn it right and left.
In an emergency (when you can't wash your hands) we should shake hands with a wet spoon and then use antibacterial gel (in drugs, 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the hand-washed door or door (the recommendation of the Chief Health Inspectorate).
Open them up through the paper handle.
Iran's President says that he has rejected the proposal for US talks, Donald Trump rejects
Tehran did not hold talks with the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite an offer by the Americans to abolish sanctions, Iranian President Hasan Rowhani declared on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked to remove the restrictions that he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hasan Rowhani, the Americans have proposed lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It should regulate both the Iranian nuclear programme and the ballistic pressure building programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not take talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran said he did not agree to these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He claimed to have met with American diplomats because he hired France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not take talks in the "maximum pressure" atmosphere.
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5+1 format, no one is able to predict what the outcome will be," Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the US, and the European parties to the nuclear agreement rejected the promotion of US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the US came from a nuclear agreement "with an initial condition which does not allow" to open the dialogue.
If we can cope with this precondition and if America is going to suffer sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America – he said.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, although he did not agree to such a conversation in the coming week during the UN General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the request of the Iranian side.
"Iran wanted me to bear the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said "no!" the president of the United States tweeted.
Voltage with the atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to alleviate tensions between Washington and Tehran in some way to save the 2015 agreement with Iran, which were signatories.
It decided that, in exchange for the abolition of economic sanctions, Iran would resign from the nuclear weapons building programme and that the nuclear sector would be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the agreement in May 2015, its signatories have repeatedly confirmed their wish to maintain the agreement.
Nothing's ever worked out.
Washington is using the maximal pressure tactics against Iran, and sanctions include a full embargo on Iran's oil.
Tehran said that if it does not receive the export authorisation of the raw material, any 60 days will limit its obligations resulting from the agreement.

The judge of the Administrative Court of Warsaw and the husband of Emilia, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsAppa, participated in the stakeout against the judges, was on Wednesday restored to the charge by the NSA.
The reason: there was no disciplinary procedure against him, so there is no basis for the WSA President Wojciech Mazura's administration to withdraw him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary attorney at the NSA, initiated an investigation against Smydt at the end of August, but it has not so far been transformed into an action against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must take a decision by the WSA president within one month of its issue.
In this situation, the judge, who has publicly mentioned his wife's mental problems to discredit her, who has been removed from the KRS office because of suspicions of participation in the Heteric Group, will return to cause and will issue judgments on behalf of the Polish Republic.
Judge Schmidt opposes his participation in the Heather Group.
He claims that there is no evidence of this except for fake screens and his wife's words that he divorces.
That's exactly what the other judges say about "Casta": they're all innocent, there's no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they're on their own.
Because the prosecutor didn't tip her finger in order to secure evidence from their electronic carriers, she's also talking about the content of the phone Emilia Schmidt, which stopped the phone in June in another case.
The police didn't tip their finger to protect the devices of the people they chased as persecutors in the February report by Judge Waldemar Žurek.
There's no evidence – there's no Smith case, there's no Casty case.
There is also no case of the head of the NIC Marian Banasis to rent a stone to supporters and to hide income.
The CBA is checking his assets statements.
And he'll check when he checks.
The Commission on Economic Ethics will also not take part in the Banas because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Commission has somehow gathered to take a decision to revoke the representatives of Banasia and to call as his lawyer, although the law of such a prestigious combination does not provide).
The whole thing reminds me of an American movie novel about how a wife goes home and stops her husband with a lover in bed.
She's so proud and upset she can't cross words.
It stands in the door of the window, while the lover jumps out of the bed, wears and goes out.
And the husband's got a bed.
When a wife regains her voice and screams: "What is this to be?"
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks, "What woman, baby?"
It is only in the case of Casta or Banasia that the state parody is concerned.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Ličwinko in the final jump above
Previously back in this season to compete after the break of the mother's race, the bronze medalist of the world championships from London 2017, won 1,85 and 1,89 in the first attempt and in the second 1,92 in the second.
1,94 managed to achieve it in the third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the finals, I'll have to jump better technically," she admitted to the Eurosport camera Ličwinko.
The best eliminations were made by American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karina Demidik – after 1.94.
Both contestants as the only ones didn't build any height.
The final jump on the top of the women is scheduled for Monday.
Starting at 7:30 p.m.
Colonel Morawiecki lives in a hospital in a difficult state
He's gone to the hospital, and his doctors are calling his condition difficult.
We need to add that he's awake and conscious.
“We believe that it will come out of it again.
We all pray for him to come back to health," said an anonymous close friend of Cornell Morawiecki in a conversation with the "Super Express" journalists.
In the forthcoming election, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
"I am kept by my closest family and politics," said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview that he gave two weeks ago to the "Super Express" journalist.
In January "Super Express" reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki was studying at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and I went to the hospital.
It turns out I've got a yellow doll.
But the worst was in front of me.
When a computer tomograph study was conducted, it was found that I had a new puzzle..." the Prime Minister said.
A few days later at MSWiA Hospital in Warsaw, Cornel Morawiecki went through a serious operation.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Dud sent his personal chaplain, President Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and went well.
“I know that many people have prayed for me for which I am very grateful.
Luckily, I don't have any breaks.
I don't know if I'm going through chemotherapy yet.
I give myself to the doctors of specialists who are rather good at thinking.
I have to go back to some state of use after this difficult operation.
I hope everything will be okay," he said in January in a conversation with Mr. Cornel Morawiecki.
"If I were to undergo a study too late, the situation would be tragic and I would be blessed with this fall..." he added.
Kraków: A 14-year-old missing
Officers from the City Police Command in Kraków are looking for 14-year-old Nel Stokłosa.
Anyone who has any information about the missing is asked for contact.
The missing 26 September evening left the place of residence and has not yet returned, nor has it come into contact with close contact.
She was last seen at the Old Guest Street in Kraków.
Nel Stoklössa is 14 years old, measures 167 cm, has blonde hair and grey-white eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in blue, gray under and shoes.
Anyone who has any information about the missing is requested to contact the police under No. 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of lead jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports professions, played on Sunday afternoon, 15 September at the epidrome on Oleandra Street in Olava, may be for some wrong.
For the real power of the road is far away, but that's the name of one of the types of horse racing...
The competition for jumps is to be fought by the rider and the riders of higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international professions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding that the long and still uninhabited world record, established in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
So high in Olawa, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local Amazons at 135 cm is not the worst...
The professions organized by unsolicited Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS operators “In the Chamber” were an indicative part of the earlier ‘Purples’ that we are writing about in this issue on page 22.
There were eight Amazons competing in the oil JKS.
Four were competing on hips and four on big horses.
The first group was best written by Nikola Szoldra, a crazy "Sprinter".
This small, but how dynamic the rumak began to overcome the 40 cm-wide obstacles, and ended only when it was stationed with the top bee away from the ground by 125 cm.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three further refusals was removed from the competition by the jury.
Amelia Pawlak took the second place in the jumps of the puppies, with the third Lena Borunj on the "Harmider".
Inga Aksman, who was galloping and jumping through obstacles to the little "Carmen".
Even more emotions have been associated with starting Amazon and we see in the competition with large horses.
The terrible falls were counted by Paulina Szewczyk, who bore the “Declarations” and Anastassia Abramenko, who drove on the “Lettce”.
Luckily, apart from the small cracks of neither the Amazon nor the horses, nothing bad happened, so they continued to participate in the competition.
Many problems with the introduction of the young "Wineta" cry for the park had to do with it by Weronika Lückiewicz.
She needed either an assistant coach or another horse to the pair, followed by a little crazy "Wineta".
After counting the obstacle from the park, she also went full of mud, so moments in the boxes and at the diner it became dangerous. "It's all under control!" Jan Sienkiewicz calmed down a bit of these frightened sights, especially the youngest.
From the start of the competition of the great horses, Marta Masalska was very well on the parking lot, with a beautiful display of "Whisky".
This worthy call, in pairs with experienced Amazon, after the second final phase approach, jumped 135 cm first and was the best result at that time.
At the same time, however, Paulina Szewczyk was also counted as "Declarations", Veronica Lückiewicz as "Winece" and Anastasja Abramenko as "Lotce".
So all these racers went out together, and finally together with the Amazons on the cushions in the direction of the Radecki march, they made an effective round of honor, ending these interesting and exciting professions.

Max Kolonko withdraws from KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which political formation #R Revolution Mariusza Max Kolonki was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution has directed its proposal, in particular, to young voters with legal views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced his cooperation with Mark Jakubiak, or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions had arrived, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko himself failed to collect enough signatures to show letters in any electoral district in Poland.
Now Kolonko informed Twitter that he had completed his collaboration with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
"I'll expect to delete my name from KWW.
Please do not contact my person with the person mentioned," he added and said that he would provide more information soon.
At the moment it is not known whether the journalist will continue his work or whether it is the end of the #R Revolution.
On July 4th, on the American Independence Day, US journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko informed of the emergence of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has been listening to the lead on the YouTube channel of Max TV, where he comments on events in Poland and the world.
"We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It was time for the authorities in the country to embrace the people and rule for the good of the people," Kolonko said.
The Party's programme includes issues relating to the judiciary (to be selected in general elections), tax changes (comparison of tax-free for all), military repairs (in the form of military assistance for the countries of the eastern NATO flag, with particular regard to Poland), the holding of arms referendums, the reduction of the number of ambassadors or the introduction of uniform electoral districts.
A few days after the announcement of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined in his talks with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko placed information on his profile in the social media suggesting that #R will connect forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions finally arrived.
UBS: Gold near the balance point
"The euro course will be held in the next few months in the vicinity of the 4,35 zł trap, which will accompany a weak global market economy," says Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of maintaining a steady pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy are talking about stabilising gold ratings in the current trap," said Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite the clear inflationary pressure of the Monetary Policy Council, the Council does not decide to raise its feet in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks are making policy easier.
"If gold is properly valued – the euro should remain in the next few months in the vicinity of the cap 4,35 zł – Polish bonds are so little attractive.
Much more profitable profitability from Polish paper offers bonds from emerging markets," says Michael Bolliger, head of the allocation of assets to markets that enter UBS Wealth Management.
According to the expert, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world economy.
"Global slowdown can be further deepened, but there should not be a serious recession, and what is the highest in GDP dynamics is slightly below zero," says Michael Bolliger.
"Investments should ignore global actions that may damage the prospects for a US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment procedure and brexit.
Europe should be relatively weak among the stock markets," according to the latest letter to the investors of the main authority managing UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele.
"The euro area countries' shares should behave worse than the Americans because they are more vulnerable under increased uncertainty about global trade and concerns before the slowdown," we read in the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, since the market share of bonds in the most secure countries has depleted the profitability of Germany’s 10-year-olds even to negative 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, in the longer term, the profitability of long-term and short-term securities should no longer fall due to the mitigation of monetary policy by banks.
The biggest field to lower feet has Fed, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency in the horizon for years to come.
The long-term balance sheet for euro ratings is a margin of $1.29, which would mean a 19-percent potential to strengthen the single currency for the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fed's feet, which will lead to a reduction in the difference in monetary policy in the world.
"To maintain the long-term strength of the dollar, they may not allow current and budgetary deficits," Michael Bolliger says.
The Bundeswehr is losing his weapon.
German MON confidential report
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehra has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19 445 ammunition – resulting from a confidential set of RFN defences.
Information was provided by the press belonging to the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the parliamentary office, the Secretary of State of MON Peter Tauber (CDU) has so far been able to remeasure two weapons, one part of the weapons and 3474 ammunition.
Among the military equipment that remains missing are six MG3, 11 G3, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal guns and two P8 machine rifles.
In addition, 30 lufs are missing from MG3 machine carabines.
The situation was alarmed by the Vice-President of the Levica Party, Martin Renner.
As RND journalists have said, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "stirring".
More than that, only a handful of lost equipment has been found as a result of the investigation.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as "necessary balance".
She also criticised the fact that the summary did not show whether there was also a weapon found in the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehry Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the state and of violating the provisions of the Firearms Act.
The officer was accused of preparing massacres on the German front with extreme legal and racist initiatives.
His "black list" of objectives, which had fallen into the hands of the prosecutor, included the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, human rights defenders and founder of Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally entered four firearms, more than 1000 ammunition and more than 50 explosive charges.
The crying kids on the plane.
How can we avoid them?
There's a solution.
Japan Airlines has recently used a function designed for people for whom travelling with a crying child is a nightmare.
By means of the website, the lines allow to check the layout of the aircraft.
If the connection is travelling less than two years of age, the "child icon" will appear on a specific, reserved by the parents or the caregivers of the seat.
The person using the services of the carrier is therefore able to choose a place away from that occupied by the young person.
The BBC reports that the lines have already informed of the failure of this solution.
The "child icon" will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if the last moment has changed the plane.
As expected, the idea was shared by the netizens.
Part of Twitter users point out that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved by listening to reducing noise.
They're kids. We used to be kids.
"We need to learn tolerance, because we will soon need maps of places for breathing, suffocating or drinking," wrote user G Sundar.
Another of the netizens noticed that he had been disturbed by crying children on the plane, but he changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also no lack of Japan Airlines’s solution.
"Thank you for warning me from screaming children during a 13-hour trip," wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Major counts losses after bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel office
More than 25 thousand foreign tourists will not arrive in October to leave for Majorca as a result of the announcement on Monday's bankruptcy by Thomas Cook's travel office.
As the representatives of the Balearic government of Marc Pons, among the 25 thousand journalists who will not be able to take advantage of the October leave in Majorce, are also those who were to travel with companies directly related to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected students who had to give up their vacation in Majorce next month because of the fall of the British firm were German citizens and Scandinavian countries.
However, as Pons argues, because Thomas Cook did not drive tourists to the Balearic Islands during November-May, losses for the local economy will be smaller.
He announced that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators on "the entry into the market of Majorka" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to estimates, the newspaper "Diario de Mallorca" found that more than 1000 people lost their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorce.
About 800 are released staff from Thomas Cook's office in Palmia.
Other people lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, along with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many hotels, the property owners asked the guest to collect an additional overnight fee.
This situation has been experienced, among other things, by several dozen tourists from Poland.
By Thursday, the Balearic Government estimates that several decades of hotels in Majorce had stopped at least by the end of October in connection with Thomas Cook's announcement of bankruptcy and the company working with him.
In turn, the Friday newspaper "Diario de Ibiza" indicates that most Ibiza hotels that worked with Thomas Cook do not deal with the intention of closing accommodation in the next few weeks.
The newspaper reminds us that on this Balearic island, British bankruptcy was co-operating with 42 hotels.
On average, the Balearic authorities announced that they would call on the Spanish government to support the region with EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by the announcement of bankruptcy by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
They have revealed that the most damaged on this Archipelago of tourists, about 36,000 people, is on Majorce.
According to the Balearic government, Thomas Cook is a local tourist company, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period from July to September 2019 of around EUR 5 million.

Previously, "White-Red" played two games – October 3rd on the trip from Cyprus, and five days later in Kielcach with Brazil.
Poland's rivals include Spain, Czech, Azerbaijan and Moldova.

‘Rz’: Smog has been oppressed by the government
"The effects of the Clean Air programme are null, and coal furnaces will climb this winter as if nothing ever happened," we read on the front page of today's "Rzeczpospolite".
"To date, 82,000 applications have been made under the Clean Air programme for a total of €2 billion, of which 48 000 have been positive.
The accepted proposals amount to more than €915 million," he said, referring to data from the spokesperson for the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred are returned from the programme.
The results of the announced cloudy program are considered "frequent".
The self-governments quoted by the "Rz" will see the defeats of the "Clean Air" in too much bureaucracy.
"The programme should be much simpler: electronic reporting, mailing invoices, possible out-of-the-way verification.
This would improve action," said Mayor of the Warmin People's Bartock Jacek Wisniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm also note that in the first year of operation, less than 1% of the target set for the exchange of 3 million hilly boilers was achieved.
Although the programme budget is 103 billion zł for 10 years, i.e. 10 billion zł, this amount is virtual each year.
"The National Fund for the Protection of the Environment and the Water Economy has this year set aside $1.4 billion," we read.
Congress agrees on F-35 for Poland
Bashčak: Now Price Negotiations
The US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 of the most recent F-35 aircraft.
"This is one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but not the end of our work," Mariusz Blascjak wrote on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the most favourable price," the Polish minister added.
Agreement with Poland F-35
Poland's Air Force forces target 32 F-35 Lightning II fishermen produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, Poland agreed to their sale by the US Department of State.
The Communication emphasises that the investment in national security and foreign policy by improving the security of the NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to information from the State Department, Poland is expected to pay $6.5 billion for fishing.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract would also cover the delivery of spare parts and repair equipment, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services and related elements of logistics and programme support and staff training.
Thoughter Lockheed Martin F-35
Thoughter F-35 Lightning II produced by Lockheed Martin is a multi-purpose fifth-generation thinker.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out a mission of close support, bombings and typically imaginary air combat tasks.
Thanks to the use of stealth fishing technology, it is undetectable for radar near range.
Recently, fishermen F-35 bought Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the old F-16.
The purchase of American warplanes is also to be considered by other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Women's or girls' breeches
The Barbie producer placed a series of sex neutral rings on the market.
He wants to fight stereotypes this way.
Barbie's producer placed a series of sex neutral rings on the market
Along with Barbie with different colors of skin, figures or hair, Mattel introduced sex neutral dolls.
Toys from the Creative World series are wearing wigs.
So kids can decide whether Barbie should have short hair or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both underwear and dresses.
The dolls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothing.
It was also rejected from emphasising the characteristics of sex – gender dolls no longer have full lips, long breeds and stems or – in the case of Kena – broad shoulders.
The company believes that children do not like when their dolls have established sex norms, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with the idea of a particular sex inhibit the ambitions of girls and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
"The new dolls will allow all children to feel free," says Mattel.
Barbie, who appeared on the market in 1959 in a high-tech bathing machine and shoes, was in the past repeatedly criticized for promoting "unhealthy women stereotypes", such as an unnatural proportion of the body.
The group has responded to criticism and has already placed on the market dolls with different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
The dolls also appeared in the hijab.
Zandberg: a bike or a club Together can have multiple letters
Zandberg asked how many candidates of his party can get to the Seima from the left-hand group list (KW SLD from which the candidates start the SLD, Spring and Levicy together, starting with the common logo "Lewica"), said that this depends on the committee's outcome.
"I believe that the outcome of Levia will be very good, because we feel that people are bound to hope that Levia is not only right but also strong," he said.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60 to 80 letters.
“This may mean that either the club or the club together will have several hundred ambassadors.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I'm not gonna guess and tell you how it's going to happen," he said.
Asked if Levia Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed that we are different, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that Poland's diversity has been rewarded because we have shown that by making a difference, we have been able to deal with the common programme."
The question is whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is the leader of the SLD Vladzimijer Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that he considered the biggest beneficiaries to be central left-wing and left-wing voters.
In turn, given that it will receive the full grant, SLD denied that "the goal of the political party is to represent its voters".
Zandberg admitted to voting for himself in the Seimas elections.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he pointed out that he was interested.
"The offer is diverse and in this offer there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further," he said.
"I would, however, say very frankly and clearly that if I were found in circle 44 of the shadow, I would take an election certificate and vote in another district," he said.
"I don't think I'd try to vote for the Minister of the Kazimierka Drive (KO-PAP candidate)," he added.
In this district, the leader of the People's Republic of RP Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are launched outside the Vehicle.
Dakar: Open largest mosque in West Africa
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday to inaugurate a huge mosque, considered to be the largest in West Africa.
The Muslims arrived by bus, car and walk to the Bopp district, where there was a new mosque that could accommodate 30,000 faithful.
The facility was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, which belongs to the Sufical narration of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the match began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares of government.
The name of Massalikul Jinan ("Royal Ways") is derived from the title of Ahmado Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the brotherhood, celebrated by the saints.
The market is covered with career marble and has five minerals.
The tallest of them is 78 meters.
The market is in the middle of 15,000 faithful rooms, and the other can be located on an external Esplanade.
In the richly completed interiors you can admire the golden dome, giant giraffes and handmade decorations by workers from Morocco.
The builders say the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but there is no comparison to the mosque in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassana II mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105 thousand faithful.
The construction of the market, which cost more than EUR 30 million, has been financed from private donations.
The government, apart from the land, founded lighting, sanitation and funded road work worth EUR 10.5 million.
Coach Smile: Our problem is not Słąsk, but we alone
The pass of eight leagues without victory by the Koronas will try to break off at Friday's meeting with the Vice-Leader of the Słąska Extraclass.
"Our problem is not ravaging, but we ourselves, we have to work on what we are playing," stressed coach Mirosław Smyła.
The last Coroners and how so far the only victory in the league was recorded in the first row when they won the 1:0 benjamina games of the Cracows Frestocho.
Later, they recorded two remises and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with the Deep Lubin at 1/32 Pucharu Polski final.
“I am impressed by the optimism that in the last few seconds, the footballers were fighting for the gate, trying to get rid of it.
Their fall on the wall after the last siege did not result from the breakup, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close," said Smile.
As he pointed out, Słąsk has very strong wings, which is why he will feel a team playing in the side of the boxing sector.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play," the coach added.
In the fifth match in the Crown, there will certainly be no playing break for too much of the yellow cards of Firen Gnjatic, in the frame will also miss conjugated Jacob Žubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
Building, on the other hand, is to report in the Cup game to a few players who want to play.
"We have headaches, it seemed recently that he will not be, and now he is," Smile said.
The defender of the Crown Daniel Dzjuniel stressed that Słąsk would not be an easy rival to break the belt of the eight leagues in a row without winning, but in an extra-class everyone can win with anyone.
"We're a good team.
In the last few weeks we may not show it on the battlefield, but the moment will come that we will win and believe that it will be Friday," the baller said.
After nine rows of Coron's extraclause with five points, it takes 15th place.
Słąk has gathered 12 more and is afraid elsewhere.
The fifth match in Kieltz will start at 8:30 a.m.
These trees can disappear completely from Europe
"42% of the species of trees forming on Europe's woodland is under threat," warns the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUCN) in a Friday 'The Red Book of European Trees'.
On the front of the list are cassettes and jacuzzi.
IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was prepared by experts who, on the basis of studies, found that 42% of the 454 species of trees in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) are "highly endangered".
Among the reasons the Red Paper exchanges the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, these trees and plants are most at risk, which occur only or mainly on our continent.
In the case of typical European woodland, according to IUCN experts, 58% of species are endangered, and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and plants, are threatened with extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation is the Red Paper on forest management errors, accelerated urbanisation, too intense forest degradation, and further forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, there are also strong threats to the existence of many European varieties of furs, furs and pores.
"The consequences of human activities lead to a gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a danger to the extinction of important and underestimated varieties in Europe, which form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet," the Luc Bas report, which heads the European IUCN office.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600+
"Today PiS wants to buy Polaków, offering them the freedom to give credit that will have to pay for the next generation," says Grzegorz Schetina in an interview for "Rzeczpospolite".
In his opinion, "the entire PiS policy is pic".
At the same time, policies promise that "what is given will not be banned".
Shetyna assures in her conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that she has the idea of fighting the law and justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the polling stations.
In his view, the opposition has more potential in this regard than the Kaczynian party.
"Today, the conscious people who want to live in the normal state are more than the PiS supporters, a party that has denied its vote values, such as modesty, humility, transparency," Schetina says.
The Leader of the Civilian Coalition and the President of the Civilian Platform also noted the fundamental foundations of the KO electoral programme.
"First of all, nothing will be taken away, but the direction to the future needs to be set, because PiS is only dealing with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen after a dramaticly low investment," he said.
Secondly, it is "the energy consumption of Poles, aid and investment in those who work hard - and those who are entrepreneurs".
Shetyna explains that the KO program included a project that at least makes Poland more than 614 gold per hand, and more making – also after several sets.
Politicians have also pointed out that they do not want to compete for a divorce.
As he said, he will do as much as he can, but not promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the rulers have tried to oppose the distribution until the financial fall of the country eventually," he stressed.
The sketch in the interview for "Rz" also stated that Jarosław Kaczynski and Mateus Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Malgorzat Kidaw-Blonsk.
"We would condemn their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"The pride moves before the fall.
Kaczynski is such a husband of state as Banas is a crystal," he added.
Leader PO also said that he had not yet decided whether to apply for the chairmanship of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Large Dead Condors
Six large dead condors were found in the province of Santa Cruz in Argentina – TVN24 informs.
Experts believe that their deaths have contributed to human activity.
Condors are probably poisoned by means of predators such as pumas, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten a toxic fall.
Besides one young person, the rest of the dead condors were grown up.
"This is a great loss for the environment because the condor must reach 10-15 years in order to become fertile and able to multiply.
So we lose protected species, endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
"I think the use of toxic substance and poison affects not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the president
They've been working on the recognition of the state of the precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Dudy's office – we read in "Rzeczpospolite".
According to the newspaper, the gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle is officially called the Royal Insignium during the period of the interwar jewel of the Royal Police.
The last time he was used by the President of the City of Ignacia.
"Rz" suggests that soon such a chain can hit Andrzej Dudy's shoulder.
The Senacka Commission on Human Rights, Justice and Petitions has voted in favour of a proposal for a work on the renewal of the Orders and Notices Act in order to restore it.
The newspaper says it's also not the first attempt to bring this chain back to the head of the state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it passed by one vote.
This time, work is brilliant.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, recognizing that they would reach the President's Office's opinion.
This one came in mid-September.
"I am pleased to inform you that the Office of President RP does not comment on the position presented in this petition," President Andrzej Dera wrote.
On Wednesday the senate committee continued the case and re-enacted a little time.
"The President's office has responded briefly: it is for this to be restored," said Commissioner Robert Mamoutow of PiS, quoted by "Rz".
He tabled a proposal for legislative work which the Commission supported.
Cops will teach drivers how to drive by crossing
Police action will be conducted, inter alia, on the crossing of Al. Cieplinski from Al. Pilsudski.
Contingent actions have something to do with recent complaints by city authorities to drivers who are not always able to behave appropriately on crossing.
On Friday, 27 September, police officers are launching the "Transport Crossing" preventive action in Rzez.
It is about eliminating obstacles in traffic: crossing without getting away, not using light signals or road signs.
"We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, and so we really make life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobinski, Vice-President of the city a few days ago.
His words came out at a press conference in which the city authorities presented examples of the inappropriate movement of cars after crossings, which results in cracks.
The president then appealed to travellers to reason on the road and, among other things, to move faster on the lights or not texting during the ride.
The issue was somewhat taken up by Soviet policemen, who have since launched the Action “Transitional Crossings”.
What's the matter?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the occurrence of a restriction on crossings by drivers travelling on them without the possibility of continuing to drive.
This is a frequent exaggeration that contributes to the upsurge in the movement and the creation of cracks.
He is threatened with a mandate of 300 zł and 2 penalty points.
In addition, the uniform will pay attention to non-use of light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity of the drive, the late movement of signallers, the free passage of crossings and the long distance between vehicles.
What crossword puzzles will take place?
M.in. ul. Lisa-Kuli of Jajiellońska; al. Cieplinski of al. Pilsudski; ul. Targowy of al. Pilsudski; Place of Sreniawitów of ul. Dębrowski or ul. Hetmanski of al.
This type of action in the capital of Podcarpaca will be carried out in the next five October.
Controlled by a company that uses "Czejki" waste
"The officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Roman Peace Council and the Public Inspection of the Construction Inspectorate have checked on Friday the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste from the clean-up of "Cheyka" liquids in Warsaw are used," told the spokesperson of the Roman history of Karol Szysko.
The inspectors of the Roma age carried out checks at the establishment located in the forests of the municipality of Zielonka.
The "Dar-Trans" Private Trade-Trans transport facility, under the agreement with the "Czejka" sewerage treatment facility, is providing railway waste management services.
"An installation has been made, and an operator has been asked to provide documentation related to his activities," Szysko said.
He added that the post-control report will be transmitted, inter alia, to the Environmental Inspectorate of Warsaw.
The last check in Dar-Transie was carried out by the Vojevodz Environmental Inspectorate in Warsaw from 29 December 2015 to 11 February 2016.
It was found then that the company did not collect samples, measurements and groundwater studies, nor did it have the results of the studies of established municipal water plants from the ‘Cheyka’ sewage treatment plant.
Following the verification of WIOS Dariaz Sobota, he was called upon to stop violating the conditions of the decision.
The private business-transport facility "DAR-TRANS" Darius Saturday is one of the companies that collect waste in the form of stabilized municipal landfills from the clean-up shop "Czejka".
According to the decision to use waste in the production area, in the forests around the Greenhouse, waste is processed up to 60,000 tonnes per year.
The Warsaw City Corporation of Waterways and sewerage reported last Thursday that STUOŠ was excluded from operation during the break-up of November and December 2018, which was related to the damage of one of the fire extinguishers.
According to MPWIK, the monthly cost of their exports is 1,7 million zł (calculated on the basis of the export costs from 01/01/2019 to 31/08/2019).
Lech Wałuss supported Malgorzata Kidaw-Blonsk.
"You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my total support," Lech Wałęsa told Malgorzata Kidaw-Blonski on Friday.
"Mr. President, this is very important to me," replied the candidate of the People's Coalition to the Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that, as far as the situation is concerned in Poland, it is now "only a kibby on retirement".
Malgorzata Kidawa-Blońska met with former President Lech Wałęsa at his office at the Gdansk European Solidarity Centre on Friday.
In a brief conversation behind closed doors, the son of Wałęsa, Jarosław, also took part.
"You took on a difficult task," he said after the Lech Wałuss meeting.
"You can count on my total support," he added.
“The problems facing Poland are known to all of us.
That is why it is a great hope that you as a woman will deal with these problems, and we all, those who love Poland, will support your actions as much as possible," said the president, returning to Kidaw-Blonsk.
Very Important Words
Kidawa-Blonsk thanked you for your support.
"Mr President, it is very important to me because no one like you can talk about freedom, about constitutions and knows what it is important," she said.
"Let us show that another wise policy can be done together, but in accordance with the Constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
That's how you did your revolution, and that's how we want to change Poland," Kidawa-Blonsk stressed.
Kibic on retirement
Wałusa, in conversation with journalists, said that he is now "only a kib on retirement".
"Of course I'm watching this.
I hope we reverse the course of events, that what was good, proven, will return.
The triangulation of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And all of this has to be cleaned up, all of this has to be restored to normal action, and I believe that this time we do it.
Because if you don't, we're waiting for a street criterion," Lech Wałuss said.
"That's why it's so important for the Polish to go to the elections, decide and make their own decisions.
And this is the most important," said Kidawa-Blonsk.
"The last chance that we will improve the status of things in Poland by the card," the former president replied.
"We need to build on a new foundation"
Asked about the most important changes to be made to Poland, Kidawa-Blońska said: “The President said very well.
We have to build on a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
If there is no Trinity, if the Constitution is not respected, then we must return to the beginning and bring it to light and let everyone know that otherwise Poland will not move forward."

The Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate has adopted without amendment the law on the disclosure of family assets of the most important public officials and on the flights of the most important persons in the country.
For the renewal of the law on the property of state officials' families – without amendment – 52 senators voted, 14 opposed, three abstained.
At the same time, the senators decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during the mid-term debate by Senator PO Sławomir Fishiki.
According to him, the amendment had the law "to civilize" and to limit the scope of the statement of the property situation of the own children, the children of the spouse, the children adapted to cases where children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make the statement.
The Law on the Publicity of the Family of the Most Important State Officials, which was established in the Prime Minister's Office, was approved by the Sejm on 11 September.

In accordance with the law, each flight of the president will be a flight "in the official mission".
In flights the president will be able to accompany family members and others invited by the president.

Poles after first training in Paris, waiting for the last race
Polish netizens took their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will play a bronze medal game on Saturday.
By subjugated Vitala Heynen the way to fight the title closed the 4th defeat with the Slovaks 1:3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud about their travel problems on this unit.
This time, without such problems, they went to Paris with the Slovaks in the early Friday morning, and a few hours later they were training in the famous Berca hall.
According to the reports of the people in the profession, the world’s master’s trainer was underreached.
As assistant Heynen Mikhał Míszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just the exercise of networking elements.
“We went to the hall, but in the vast majority it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time with him than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it as a team," he said.
He confirmed that semi-final failure was a painful lesson for both players and the training staff.
"We were brutally led to earth.
Without two opinions, we're disappointed.
We still believed we were going back to this game.
We were discussing this game with each other at the station, the coach was talking a lot to the contestants.
As two main causes of defeat, I would point to insanity in the attack and much worse than usually dealing with the situational balls.
In this regard, the Slovenians were much better than us," he said.
In his view, the "White-Red" on the obstacle did not become a stress associated with the speech against supported by the loud and numerous audiences of the tournament co-sponsors.
He admitted that the world's champions could sleep a little smooth way to the semifinal.
"Perhaps if we were to fail in a similar way in a group phase, we would be faster to analyze this lesson and then play in a further stage of the tournament.
But it's just a scratch," he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with the 4th defeat of Poles will be turned into an aggression in the brown fight.
"I hope that we will then show our true faces.
It's a fight.
We last fought the ME medal in 2011," he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by the Polish during these championships.
At the group stage, they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, at the first two meetings of the group took place in Apeldoorn, and at the semifinal they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgyz: severe punishment, but suspended
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week start-up ban and a fine of $25,000, in a semi-annual suspension, for fake words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour operators are losing patience with Kyrgios, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the events of the most unbundled professional tennis player in recent years seems dangerous – 16 weeks of break plus a criminal dispute, but both penalties are suspended for half a year – a trial period in which a coastal athlete can improve.
Nick Kyrgyz is only 24 years old, but has been working out for a long time and has earned his own tennis record of the world – he has had to pay the highest in the history of discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of conduct on the court and next to it.
The loud curses, the strange gestures, the unsportable behaviour, the insult of the judge and the sights, the breaking of two missiles during the lost game with Karen Chačanov – for all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid 113 thousand dollars.
In the US Open 2019 he didn't play long, but he managed to say publicly that ATP operators were "scrupulous", which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they conducted a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgyz and, after a couple of weeks, they gave the aforementioned verdict on the suspension of startups and another fine.
However, the word of corruption was forgiven after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
However, it was argued that the investigation showed that the conduct of Kyrgios for the last 12 months in many cases caused serious reservations and almost continued infringement of the rules, that he had repeatedly injured the Volgarians associated with the tournaments and the sights, from then on a high penalty.
However, ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately dismissed the execution of the judgment, ordering him to comply within the next six months with a few conditions: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgyos tournaments, he cannot in any way violate the rules of the Code of Conduct of Professional Tennisists, in particular he can no longer persuade, destroy missiles, fight judges and the public, nor any other way to behave uninvited and vulgarly.
He also received a recommendation to seek "continuous support" from mental trainers during the tournaments and also outside the season he consulted with persons specialising in solving the problems of athletes who do not manage to behave properly.
Nick Kyrgios’s first comment (in social media) was as follows: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-hour break, since in Puchara Lavera, he had to give up from the nearest beginnings in Beijing (September 30 – October 6) and Shanghai (October 6-13).
The ATP Kyrgyz ranking takes 27th place.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, earned more than $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will have a lot.
GUS: Life in Poland is getting better
The report published by the GUS on household budgets on Friday shows that, as a good or rather good material situation, up to 44% of them assessed their material situation.
This percentage was 37.2% earlier in 2016 and 33.5% earlier, since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessment of the situation of households, it never exceeded 30%.
Its material situation was considered to be bad or rather bad in the mid-19th century to be 8.1% of households, compared to 11.2% earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The material situation of the households of those working on their own account is best.
In this group, 70% of respondents considered it to be good or rather good.
In the second run there are households of tenants, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is known to parents of single-parented offspring, among whom the material situation is declared to be good or rather good 32%.
Among children, this rate (depending on the number of children) ranges from 55% to 60% and among the homeless households is 48.8%.
These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500+ programme.
Prior to its launch (in 2016) the worst material situation was assessed by single parents raising offspring and families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessment of the material situation of Poland is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, especially from work.
However, this is not all because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, there is no clear link between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of the households.
The best evaluations are formulated by the inhabitants of the Polish voivodeship, where they consider their situation to be good or rather good 48.9% of the researchers.
There are also Ljubian municipalities (47.7%), Silesia (47.6%), Mazowiski (47.3%) and West Pomerania (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opolska, regulatory income (i.e. after tax and contributions) amounted to 94% of the national average and 98% in Lubusk.
The highest incomes were for the residents of Mazowieski (120% of the national average) and for the Slovak population (104%).
On average, in Poland a person’s regulatory income amounted to PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after a price change adjustment) there was an increase of 4.3% compared to 2017.
It's been pretty low on the ground for years.
In 2016 income per person increased by 7% and then by 6.3%.
While income growth slows down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
These were calculated per person in sub.r. 1187 zł, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person actually increased by 1.9% and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Studies in household budgets suggest that the statistical household currently accounts for 70.1% of its regulatory revenue, while this share still exceeded 80% in 2014 and exceeded 90% by 2006.

USA: Three suicides among the airport crew
Three sailors committed suicide last week on board USS George H. W. Bush – an American warship informed.
In the last two years, in total, five members of the crew of that ship have been killed.
Previously, suicide took place in July of this year and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three Marines were shot last week.
Each of these events occurred on the ground when the USS George H. W. Bush marched off the coast of Virginia.
As has been the case, the participation of third parties has been excluded.
Moreover, death is not to be associated with each other.
"Everyone needs to engage in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I would like to stress that there is no stigmatization or other repercussion related to the search for help," said Captain Sean Bailey, captain of the ship.
Nesiolovian criticism of the pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In his conversation with Piotr Lekszycki Stefan Nisiolovski, he stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge opposition force.
"In fact, each of his opinions was accepted".
Then came the criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activities of Rydská, and he is greatly appreciated for his pontificacy.
However, this Redemptorist – the victim of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best way possible for the life of Pope Polaka," he explained.
PO’s politicians admitted: “There was a blur of dissatisfaction, the pope said something he had never accepted, but he had authority and could simply send him out of the Church or send him to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do so, just like his successors," Nisiołski explained.
“In addition, this fatal case of paedophiles and activities of the Church has come to an end, and indeed their lack.
I ran a little ahead of myself, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole of his life.
We've known about the scale of paedophiles in the Church since recently.
There is a question as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things," says the journalist Nisiolovski.
In the assessment of the former PO policy, the Polish Church is an ally of PiS.
“We must admit that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.
All the saints began from the holy mass, hanging across the cross.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that such people as Rydzek shake the Polish Church that John Paul II did nothing about it and that the Church today is an ally of PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which the island will pay for it," Nisiolovski convinced.
"I hope that Pope Francis will drive the Adriatic, Rydzika and a few others of this type," he said.
HRUBIESZO: Tomorrow business 590-year-old

The PZPN's being punished for barding in the stadiums.
Gryf Qualified
The beginning of the Polish Pucharu between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk with small hair did not end tragically when the Wejherov rockets fired by the Wejherova rockets with millimetres passed the opposing team brake, Zlatana Alomerovica.
After that incident, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
In this case, the PZPN Commission has imposed a severe penalty on Griffo, excluding him from the next game.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, the kibbies will not be placed in the nearest match at their own stadium.
They will also not be able to go to the leagues until December 31st.
The Kurds at the Vidzev Łódź stage also caused the kibika Słąska Wrocław.
However, the PZPN judgment was more mild because Słąsk had predicted that similar events could occur and felt the appropriate authorities in this regard.
Nevertheless, the services have allowed the shipbuilding sector to be abandoned by rabies, the burning of chairs and the strengthening of the economic sector.
This game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervention police had to use the watercraft.
PZPN punished Słąsk with a one-time stadium ban in the nearest match in Pucharz Polski and banned the organisation of matches in this and subsequent PP release.
The ban on departures also included League Extraclas matches, but will last until 31 December.
Foreign names of cities on road signs also in Poland
GDDKiA plans to exchange the marking on the entire managed network of roads by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Reese
In Podcarpac, the implementation of the new regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on e.g. the registration of foreign names of cities on road signs also began after Poland.
For example, "L'viv" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our voivodship, changes will be made to 94 road signs set at A4 motorways and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it's supposed to be easier, easier and easier.
The new guidelines result from the innovation of the Minister of Infrastructure Regulation on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that local names in neighbouring countries are often also Polish.
Thanks to the changes we have made, they will finally appear on the roads along our roads.
The introduction of a new label starts with the sub-carpack section of the A4 motorway," Andrzej Adamczyk, the infrastructure minister, informed.
The Subcarpathia change will be introduced on 94 road signs set at A4 motorways and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The total investment cost?
200 grand.
In the first place, a new label will be implemented on A4 highway, which is planned for the period until 1 November 2019.
What's the idea to look like?
He'll have to do it without changing the plates, in principle.
They will replace the existing locality names with new ones written in Polish on existing characters.
Both names will be recorded in one line – in the first order after Poland and then in the original, in the seal.
This will be a great relief for people who do not know the official names of foreign cities in the country where they are located.

Someone shot the windshield.
In the condition of the Castle in Lower Silesia, the residents noticed the scars of the wing problems.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had set up an animal’s target – the windshield was found in his body.
“The information about the injured bird was received from the residents of the village of the Wild Animals Rehabilitation Centre in New Soli.
The report showed that the animal had broken wings.
We've done our best.
Now it was obvious something was wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to hurt him or affect his additional stress.
The lab was caught and put into the vet.
After the first RTG shot, it was already known that someone had made himself a target.
In his body, there were fractures of the line," says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, who manages, among other things, the rehabilitation center.
Overtakes in the center
"The wounds have been cleaned, the bird has been given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the center where it will spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly right now.
The release would now be linked to the likely not to survive winter," Walasek adds.
The staff will release it on the same condition after being rehabilitated.
The authorities of the municipality of Zjukowice, after receiving information on the cause of the animal health condition, intend to inform the prosecutor.

Gowin: "We need to stimulate Polish, small trade"
"The effective taxation of supermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, it will have to be wondered whether the country has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement on Friday.
Gowin, during the "Day Signals" talk in the Radio Unit, said that trade is controlled by international networks that impose so low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
In view of the fact that this problem is very difficult to tackle, the vice-premier recalled that the government of PiS tried to address it at the very beginning of the term of office, but received a "opportunity on the part of the KE".
"We have won before the Court of Justice and I hope that if the United Law wins the nearest elections and forms the government, we will return to this issue," he said.
At the same time, he noted that "the effective taxation of supermarkets does not solve the Polish problem, so small trade".
"It will also be necessary to consider whether the government has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May, the EU Court found that the European Commission made a mistake in recognising that Polish retail tax is not permitted by public aid.
The retail tax law imposed two trading tax rates: 0.8% from income between 17 million zł and 170 million zł each month and 1.4% from income above 170 million zł each month.
The data were to be valid from September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC initiated infringement proceedings against EU law by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be regarded as public aid.
It subsequently concluded that the tax was implemented in a manner incompatible with the law.
It also issued a decree suspending the application of the tax until its analysis has been completed by the officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but tax collection has been suspended.
The EU Court's May judgment opened the way for reintroduction of the tax, but did not end the case.
On 24 July the Commission brought an appeal before the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TEU press services informed the PAP that the case is now at a written stage in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government present their arguments in writing.
It is not known at this time whether or not the oral procedure, i.e. the hearing of the parties and the possible debate, is being moved.
It takes a couple of months before the appeal is filed.
"This is an average year," the PAP said a source in the Luxembourg Court.
How do you dress a child for baptism?
Several practical solutions are being developed
Christ is an essential Christmas in the life of the infant and his parents.
It is often the first time that the entire family is focused around the child, celebrating his or her appearance in the world.
It's no wonder, then, that freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look the best that day.
Before you make a final decision about your child’s machine, however, ask yourself if it will be convenient.
You can find a lot of machine kits in the shops that do not provide a small suitable comfort.
So what should you pay attention to?
The primary criterion for selecting baptismal candidates is the age of the child
Until recently, small ones, dressed in white sets, were baptized into the same bees or large dust.
Today children who approach the sacrament are often older: several months, years, and even older.
It is not hard to imagine that so much comfort is needed by something else to get baptized.
So if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, it is likely that he or she will be in a wheelchair or on the hands of parents or Christian parents.
The best way out will be to equip him with comfortable, cottony muscles or completes.
Although this wardrobe element is considered to be a daily machine, it is enough to search for its sacred options, for example with a falbank or crown.
For the boy, the perfect points are displayed with the impression of the muscles and the ribs.
In the case of older children, you can be allowed to have a greater imagination in your dress.
The girl will look cute in a simple, titular dress
Many parents of depressed girls look at the rich side of the falbanian dress on the christen in a set of coats, blankets and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers are using artificial, inhaling materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
Looking for the appropriate clothing will better look for the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant machines on cotton underpants.
Delicate, thick underwear, satin dresses, crowns, applications and charming sets make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.
Ideal equipment for a small gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently among the boys' parents was fashionable in suitage, which was a copy of "adult" models.
Polyester sailors and inferiors, rigid ankles or caskets often caused young elegants to show their dissatisfaction.
Fortunately today, they were separated by comfortable, cottoned kits.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, dressless underwear, and also the blouse decorated from the front to the model of the trouser.
These machines look extremely sacred, and at the same time they do not bend the movements of the small world.
Krystyna Pawłowicz published a statement
Kristina Pawłowicz made a statement of her property at the end of her term of office.
As a result, the apostle PiS gathered 110 thousand evil savings.
Let's remember that Pavlović ordered her to leave politics.
At the end of the term of office, the amount is 110,000 zł
As a result of the letter's statement, she is retired at a monthly value of $4.7 thousand.
Pavlović has an apartment worth 570 thousand zł and a little smaller that rents, taking 880 zł per month.
The letter also invests in industrial metals, evaluating the investment for 150 thousand zł.
The previous asset statement was also published by Jarosław Kaczinski.
Voting on the break during the Conference of the Conservative Party
The British parliamentarians voted against the three-day break in the Gmin Chamber's discussions at the annual program conference of the Conservative Party, which the government has referred to.
289 apostles said so, against 306.
The Gmin Chamber does not normally discuss during the parties' conferences, so that the Ambassadors do not have to give up their participation in them or from Parliament's meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that during such a crucial period, as were the last few weeks before the UK leaving the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the debate.
At the request of the Government, there were 289 apostles against 306.
Two opposition parties already after the conventions
The lack of leave may be taken as a political revenge for the opposition of Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the Supreme Court found it incompatible with the law and the law) and that the judges do not wish to apologise for it.
After that decision, the Gmin Chamber resumed on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was the appearance of Johnson and the next lively debate after her.
Johnson rejected the opposition to block Brexit and to avoid early elections.
“The time has come to realize brexit.
It is necessary to implement it in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with the priorities of citizens, the health service, the cost of living.
Brexit must be realized so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.
The Conference of the Conservative Party will begin in Manchester on the next Sunday and will last until Wednesday 2 October.
The two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already been held.
One of the reasons Johnson gave, explaining the long suspension of parliament, was that it was a party conference.
Media: Andrzej Doda accuses Israel of anti-chemical attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-chemical attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," foreign media say.
The President's handbook has deplored these reports.
"It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, including "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post", referring to "Jewish Insider", say that Andrzej Duda, when meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the RP Consulate in New York, said that Israel was guilty of the last anti-chemical attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, who said in February that “Poland sent anti-Semitism with mother’s milk”.
Andrzej Duda said he was sorry that Israel had not apologized for the insulting remarks of its policies.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish Ambassador to Israel by Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted, "Polk, Polak".
“The quote is not only incorrect.
It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda “never said that Israel was responsible for the last anti-chemical attacks in Poland”.
According to the Speedy Portal, "it was invented".
According to the “JI” speakers at the meeting, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivors, appointed by the Order of Merit of the RP Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Dudy's words and say that the Jews from Israel "as Israel Kac" are responsible for the growth of anti-Semitism.
According to the sources of the Boteach portal, he was supposed to interrupt Mosberg's statement.
Who's Banas, and what did he do?
Rented by stonekeepers, the journalist led to the discovery of neglect in Mariana Banasia's property statements.
We're summarizing another affair that shook the governor's camp.
TVN newsmagazines reported that Marian Banasz, the president of the Supreme Court of Control, has not recorded a 400-metre-stone asset statement in recent years.
Moreover, his tenant had in the said rock sexbiznes (so to rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself has been said to have secured the payment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel noted the irregularities in the Supervision program.
The journalist revealed that the stone was being hired by the people associated with the criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
Clients were supposed to be men using prostitute services.
Banas replied indistinctly and indiscriminately.
What's interesting is that the stonekeeper's rental led the journalist to discover neglects in Banasia's property statements.
The stone itself was described in detail in them, and the income from her rent was to be reduced.
“The mother of Mariana Banasis and his wife can be worth between 6 and 8 million zł.
In short, married couples can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...]", says Money.pl.
And as it turns out from the portal analysis, the stone of Banasis was worth about 3 million zł.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office is currently overseeing Mariana Banasi's property statements for 2015–2019.
Banas said that by the time she's finished, she's going to hang out in NIC. "I'm going to go out with you for a free leave," he said.
The opposition demands clarification.
"We do not hear that the CBA has expanded its investigation or accelerated the investigation of Marian Banasi's claims.
We are therefore obliged to hand over to the State authorities and to report on the possibility of committing a crime [...]," said Mr Po-KO Mariusz Witczak.
"If ordinary Polak had so much appreciation for the rental of his property, he would already have 10 controls, tax domains and criminality," he added.
He went high, fell low
Marian Banasz is the new president of the Supreme Court of Control.
This position was called on 30 August 2019 for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was declared by the Law and Justice and the political votes of the party.
Banasz was previously associated with NIC in 1992-2005, acting as a co-worker of Lech Kaczynski.
During the first governments of PiS (2005-2008), Banas held the position of President of the Customs Service and also the Deputy Secretary of State of the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has again sat at the Customs Service Chief's table and has been managing the National Treasury since 2017.
Banas served three months in the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Mateus Morawiecki.
Cooler Master introduces catch for graphic cards
The graphics cards can now weigh really much, and this naturally takes place for the product category that would be empty to search in the store half a decade ago.
This is the solution – capture for the ELV8 RGB graphics card – presented Cooler Master.
The new capture model for the graphics card is not only a functional solution that allows for more secure maintenance of the graphics card without depending solely on the strength of the PCI-express slot.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task – decorative.
"Rzeczpolita": Ignoring the police command will be punished
According to the newspaper, the violation of a particular order of conduct issued by the police is to be a new type of offence, which is threatened by a criminal, arrest or restriction of liberty.
The police want to make such a change.
The idea came to the Commission's summit on the Question of Petitions.
"The case is serious, because now every year more than half a million extrajudicial cases are before the Polish courts," we read.
The 'Rechtpospolita' has established that the request that the Independent Police Trade Union writes to the ambassadors on the amendment of the Code of Infringement has a chance of success.
The authors of the petition shall propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Infringement.
It should be said that “If a public official does not comply with a request or order issued within the limits and on the basis of the law, he shall be liable to imprisonment, imprisonment or restriction”.
"Par. 3 of this provision speaks of the same penalty for those who are unable to carry out their duties, impossible or difficult to carry out their duties," the newspaper said.
Socijolog Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpolitij", that although he agrees with the main transmission of the proposal for a regulation, he is afraid that if it is implemented, it can be used in political demonstrations.
"In the situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be pointless and instead of attenuating the situation, rather than aggravating it," he adds.
According to the statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of the citizens were positive about police interventions in 2018 and 1.5 million interventions per month were taken into the city.
The Bureau is concerned about Europe
My Topol writing is in the blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
Father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important military Czech dramatists, today mentioned in a row with Václav Havl.
Thus, from the start of his reign, the curse of the talent that he was trying to use hangs.
After eight years he came back with a "Responsible Man".
Heroes are Buras and Sonya, along with two sons, who do not form a typical Czech family.
They're marine actors, they're traveling across Europe.
He's a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she's an eye translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth didn't make a sound out of himself, and the other boy stopped during childhood.
But they're not heroes in this story.
All of them are the only way to observe a world where there is no room for artistry.
It's a world of incapacitated provinces, societies of the old, suspicious people, and so on.
"Responsible Man" places are turned into an absurd theatre.
Narration imitates didascalia, and the conversations of heroes create this world.
The stage is Europe's full concern about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to Thomas Cook bankruptcy
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook fell, his Belgian daughter Neckermann works.
However, the company has problems.
According to VRT TV, Brussels Airlines announced that they are cancelling 105 flights in October due to problems related to Thomas Cook's bankruptcy.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All departures with the office reserved in Belgium will be cancelled, but in time they will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Gandawi also announced the fall of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased by Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were to leave with the office by the end of the year.
Even on Monday, Counselor Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is currently "in full operation" despite the announcement of a mother's fall by the British company, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then agreed that the customers who bought a trip in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel offices in the world – announced a fall on Sunday night on Monday.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was to break down Sunday's last chance talks with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors claimed that, in addition to the agreed rescue plan of 900 million pounds in August, the company received an additional 200 million as collateral for the winter period when the travel office usually has lower turnovers.
However, the company's problems have grown over the years, which has resulted in a debt of £1.6 billion.

“I don’t think that Slovenia has played fantastically.
That's what we played very weak.
This tournament hasn't finished for us yet," said Polish netizens Michael Kubiak after defeating Slovenia 1:3 in the semifinal European championship.
Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the arrival of German Görlitz.
The actions will help to combat the continuing decline in the number of city dwellers.
Görlitz is Germany's eastmost city.
The beautiful pastel shop attracts 140 thousand tourists each year.
However, as The Guardian writes, the city is facing major problems.
In Görlitz there are the lowest wages in Germany.
The city also faces a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left west of the country, leading to a 25% decline in the city's population.
In 2013, it was 54 thousand people.
To fight the population, officials came up with an idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
As far as 150 applications were concerned.
Two thirds of them put in big cities.
The programme was also attended by individuals from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought that the programme should convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the project participants.
"Now we feel that it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free dwellings, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the whole country.
While the city authorities hope that some will take place on a regular basis, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the opinion of the programme participants.
Information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move – what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with the idea of evicting new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a payment program promising young specialists for life and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy or in the U.S. Tulsa in Oklahoma.
