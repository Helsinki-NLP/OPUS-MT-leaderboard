Triomph of right populists in Austria, they have 29 percent total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria led to a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current large coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly important losses.
On the other hand, the EU electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, prepares a triumphal return on the political stage at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, with 5.5 per cent of the votes lost.
The OVP, which lost almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent, ended up even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major parties in the post-war war; particularly for the popular party, which launched the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
At the beginning of July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advance on the SPÖ.
However, the electorate has apparently castrated them for having let the government sink.
As soon as the results were met, speculations about the possible resignation of the party leader and current deputy chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were made.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary board of directors of the party.
Such a change would make it easier to advance the path towards the outcome of the most likely election, namely the renewal of the great SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
However, in view of the strengthening of the two right populist parties - the books (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repeat of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still unified, in 2005 the BZÖ separated itself) on a common government, which even brought about sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he was ready to work with any party and that he intended to return to Vienna, on the national political stage, apparently on this evolution.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they slightly lost and returned, amongst the Austrian political parties, from third to fifth positions.
Of course, no other party broke the limit of four percent and did not access Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India risk cooling
If there was no solution to the problem of Czech researchers accused in India of illegal cafards collection, it would be followed, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-India relations.
The Minister told him today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, which was carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, from talks, that executive power could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished by a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, since the case was placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"Your problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could request bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, as a result of which he could be thanked," says the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted people with "competent legal support", the Indian Minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them on the part of India.
"We wish above all to keep with India the best relations, which have a tradition continuing over many years.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers to be a great disgrace," he said.
The Minister questioned whether he had obtained from India the promise to deal with the case.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he said only.
A Czech Arbitrates the Battle for the Seabed
It is approaching a walled electronic map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he was not interested in the continent, but in a little lost point in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
His head, the head of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and complete time to another.
The burning of work and enthusiasm characterizes the revolving atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little known world so far, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms for the unknown moment, which may contain the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A Wider Background Than the Earth Closes
The coastal states have begun their days of thirsting for new sub-sea territories.
According to a United Nations convention, they are actually using their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is especially the area of what is called the continental shelf, which is often several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
The latter may, under the Convention, rely exclusively on all the resources of the continental ruler.
"To simplify, it is considered as a continental self the part of the seabed and its groundwater, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred thousand marines that represent that one exclusive economy," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country concerned submit to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on numerous cost-effective prospecting and control.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific assistance.
To date, the Commission has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
At the moment, only the last three countries have been successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia's success, which was the first to have significantly expanded its sub-marine holdings, has recently experienced a global hold-up.
New Zealand, too, has gained from the territory - the seabed, which was allocated to the Commission last week, is 1.6 million square kilometres, representing the country's six-fold range.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefits they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will be invaluable, as they intend.
In turn, other countries will submit their requests.
They may do so within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, proclaimed by the convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"However, don't fool us, the seabed isn't a Klondike," says Director Mikulka exaggerating, stating that "his areas are clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former bloc of the countries of the East as part of the "Interoceanmetal" joint organization.
This was achieved in 1991 under the Convention, as well as by investors from several other States, the status of what is called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area projected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is moved there, it's some kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract it from an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a rich deposit in polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of this.
She remembers a small strawberry, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoot, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were in place for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had called for Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were never put into action.
Further details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are revealed.
According to information provided by the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Thus, both federal army specialists and GSG 9 officials from the Federal Police and Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from Technische Hilfwerk, were on the scene of release.
As the Departments spokesperson communicated it on Monday night, the German forces were finally not required, the hostages who had released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian Government would have accepted the help provided by Germany to integrate it into support force on site.
"This has not happened so far," said a spokesman for the Ministry of the Federal Interior.
The aggressors had removed in southern Egypt the group of tourists made up of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their kidnapping in the wilderness south of Egypt, hostages were transhipped into the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of host hostages has remained vague so far, as well as details of release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have, in the meantime, arrived healthy and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the released hostages were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bill", the five vacationers and the special forces should have taken off on board an Airbus from the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives refuses the rescue plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress had recently failed the plan to save heavy financial markets of $700 billion.
The Dow Jones was in the abyss.
By 227 votes to 206, the United States Chamber of Representatives rejected the Government's plan for the rescue of financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by U.S. President George W. Bush and political men at the head of the two parties, the program that had to deal with the chaos of financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the opponents of this heavy plan of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debate, had called on Members to vote in favour, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue plan could cover.
He left shortly before the end of the vote, then, after the announcement of failure, fell again.
Experts are now designing serious new turbulences on international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the approval and approval of the House of Deputies and the Senate are necessary.
Organizers report an increasing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
With regard to reservations for the coming months, according to one study, the number of cases increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite poor economic prospects, the thirst for German travel remains unsatisfied according to this study.
With regard to winter reservations, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent over the same period in the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) entrusted to Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey by the GfK Research Institute, increasing number of reservations already dominates the fall months.
Thus, the sales figure would have increased to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, according to the RDV.
The sources of these results are GfK figures, which monthly analyzes booking data from 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel reservations made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low dollar rate, travel to the United States would be requested in particular, the VDR would say.
There, the increase in reservations would amount to about one Third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our opposite, would be destinations specifically sought by the Germans.
The trips organized in particular are very requested, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food, the costs would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with discounts of early bookings or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been so much retained that an increase in sales figures will be re-registered compared to last year - although another study shows that the number of Germans who took a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
The hits of Ballermann or Pres-Ski continuously, of beer in liters and celebrities in Tyrolian costumes to design.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we don't actually have much in common.
She is blonde, TV animator and wears a custom-sized Tyrolean costume.
I've got my hair covered, I'm a student, and my dress is an opportunity.
But one thing connects us: almost three minutes at the beer party, and the photographers are already throwing themselves at us and filling their memory card - very flattering, and that's my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to reach its goal.
As a tourist of the beer festival and normally resident in the north of the Weiswurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on Therès, everything is half worse.
Each or almost wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one has the air blown or affected by shame - it's completely normal.
Only the table of my Tyrolean costume harvests a few odd eyeballs at the stand of chocolate bananas.
A Bavarian makes me realize that I would have misattached my table: "to the left means free, to the middle of the virgin, to the right of the married, to the back of the widow."
Discreetly, I triple my back loop to the left.
"It's better," she says, and she laughs.
Others don't get so bad for these technical flirt subtleties and wear simple pets, which are written "Too drink to get dressed!" and expose their naked back without being invited there.
The young man at the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, who comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an "ooooo" along.
He tells me all this after he's relieved of the chop he's been drinking before.
Right next to this fire mouth that everybody thinks is a garbage dump.
So Bob is one of those "wild fishers" sadly famous.
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers run on the place of the feast and have to take care of poor drinkers.
Rather, the nurses intervene in silence - always by four, they draw their Civic Cover of Tents.
This works for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we get filled.
Those who rest in the circle of burrows under the bark are not visible.
"They're the ones who can't do anything anymore," she calls me one of the rescuers in answer to my question and then disappears into the mud.
Accident victim identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday after noon on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because he was suspected of dangerous conduct.
He's been released since, under bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
Even before Turkey was planning to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate its back country.
On the east side of Bosphore, 20 steps can be, from Asia, one of the finest remnants of his imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is equipped with horses at the bottom of the platforms, with rounds of observation at each of its corners, such as certain German provincial mayors.
The stones are salty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the desired ticket, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a move to the west.
The race was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, late in the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad and has the most known land under the name of Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its region around, generated by the frozen frontiers of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the empire's forces moved beyond Egypt and drove the German Turks and their allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an explosive ammunition train destroyed its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it's a sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruins, ravaged in the middle of history.
But today, the rail crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, highlight the enlargement of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its region in the vicinity, generated by the frozen frontiers of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has outstanding relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the settings of this new foreign policy, I boarded a car-bed towards the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit the Turkish MP AKP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a ten-and-a-half-hour trip, on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital- presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning back to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots is an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and especially Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built in stones and steel, in a developing district, surrounded by half-built shopping centers and many pastries in which middle managers in custom-crawate- men and women meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a right-centre politician from any other party in Europe.
It's a costume, tie, and he even has a Black Berry.
" The aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly" he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case with each other.
She had to do both.
"But, that's when I asked if Turkey should choose?"
"Turkey" he said "doesn't want to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost all those with whom I could speak were heartily told me: the Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is an advantage for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a Europe that is metaphorically traveling on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleep, I repeated to these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been called "the disease of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Vernon Handley's memories, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: The musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (deceased on 11 September) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already taking part in his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include at least 21 years of age, but before Proteus was able to sing his last song in 1979, many of us who had more than 20 years of age - refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed in form according to mythology) represented the will and the ability of the choir to manage any type of music that was presented to him, whether he was madrical or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and this thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod told us to "let music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there in music.
So sing!"
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if it was never dictatorial or apparent.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver was to be appointed knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the 1960s to 1982, when he was driving Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them ever disappointed me-- and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley had so rare this combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, "only focus on some people."
There'll be a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (deceased on September 25, 1946) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was a BSc, a MA and a PhD".
That's what came from Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but that's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at Nottingham University, and at the same time he completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to dissipate this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino " the Flamenco and life " because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength they convey and to the fact that they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second attack for Honda's super sales
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitat, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
This adds some refined mechanics, which increase the comfort of driving and enable more fuel savings.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
So this is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz aesthetically presents a very similar line to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz is six years after the first generation market.
First of all, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model within a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Exactly in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more than one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow him to increase his sales in Europe.
Thus, while the Japanese brand had marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz in 2007, it was thinking of selling 100,000 in 2009, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The managers of the Spanish branch are hoping to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to much slow down sales in Spain.
In fact, brand owners expect to end the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, that is to say 4,000 cars unless in 2007, a 16% reduction in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this part of the market when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a hybrid with five doors and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the company hopes to commercialize nearly 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of the sales of Insight will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz is increasing its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimetres plus), its width 1.69 meters (two centimetres plus) and the distance between its axis is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimetres.
On the other hand, the height does not change by 1.52 meters.
The dimensions also increase the interior space.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a reserve of fuel in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the case - which has a double base system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity plus the first generation case.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L case is 379 litres.
Another innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is improving access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an 80-degree opening angle, partly related to the back doors of the first Jazz that would open with a 67-degree angle.
Engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two fuel propellers of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine power.
The first engine 1.2 litres develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 rpm and 114 pair Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This propeller - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propeller, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired, this time of nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Centre made this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of the Management of Marks, the BR23C represents the release of the Nissan security lock.
This robot will allow vehicles in the brand to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each bee created its own personal space in an oval shape that is much like the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the eyes composed of the bee, capable of seeing in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder).
He detects the obstacles that lie on a distance of two metres and in a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"At the moment he detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by blowing its 90-degree wheels or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference compared to any other existing system is that the escape handle is completely instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Moving Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned upward or downward, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow and not in infinite directions such as bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Every second, this device must only process and act according to this data.
He doesn't need to keep the information or the intuitive logic of prior maneuvers, so he can keep working with just a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about memory giga-octets, not even mega-octets."
This represents the first because of the development of new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced into the series cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot runs with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding roadblocks.
They're afraid of being hypothesized.
It must be acknowledged that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not devoid of genius.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: ' Bad Credit Hotel'.
That's the Hotel of Bad Credits... or Stories.
The glamour of this accommodation and especially the Master of the Hotel has led us to think several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
Of course, this game provides useful but little detailed information.
It's more a game reserved for teenagers.
What if the game ends?
Since a bedroom appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's impossible to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens his capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry to his table tour of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new welcome by a strong decline in its exchange rate.
One week after the opening of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's regular shares at the unit cost of $25.25, a total amount of $3 billion.
The price retained is less than 19% at the book value as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and with a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, which is 28 per cent above its current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79 per cent to $23.07 at 5:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the banking holding status," explained John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but make it subject to the Federal Reserve authority.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's largest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had just announced that he would sell up to 20% of his Japanese shares for about $8.5 billion.
"One week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the Executive Director of MUFG, explained to Tokyo that our pensions would be full of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation in the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley 7% below its accounting value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert within half a year its preferential securities into ordinary shares if the latter change more than 50% over the conversion price, or about $47, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should display a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that he had been "clearly" on his balance sheet since the end of August.
In the last few weeks, the group was tested, which saw its course in Borse melt half while the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt was covered.
This cost was on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's large investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merril Lynch, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part with Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refunding the republic around the socialism of the twenty-first century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorial Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it was the third to vote in favour of a new Constitution.
The mission performs as 64% of voters voted "yes" at the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the vote.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the suffrage were zero and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the more than one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling station and a non-governmental organization had announced a large victory of the "yes" between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed in a devastating way", he had assured the Ecuadorians, congratulating the governorate of Guayaquil, at 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in peace according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" advocated by the President.
The draft Constitution dedicates the State's power to the economy by reserveing the State's "development planning" of a country that lives mainly from oil extraction by foreign companies and foreign currencies sent by its migrants.
The project, elected in 2006, also provides enhanced powers to the head of State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Korea has already announced that it would use this power and would challenge a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in that country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the attack against the raves of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday after a healthy afternoon in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian command in Chad.
The hostages appear to have arrived at 330 p.m. on board a special aircraft at the Al-Maza military base at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid to the predators," said Egyptian Minister Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 at a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the borders of Egypt, the Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been shelled from one cache to another by 35 unknown predators.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian safari agency.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the attack the night before dawn.
"A firefight has occurred, and half of the predators have been killed, the others running," said this manager who demanded anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit had been sent to the Sudan in total, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through professionalism and the effectiveness of our men in secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The guard, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on a patrol, on which the predators were found, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and stopping two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group of Darfur, the Sudanese Liberation Movement, (SLA-U), which had immediately been deposed.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A discussion on the financing of culture takes place on the jaws and deals with this electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise up to denounce the sums of poverty that are granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
What politician will remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and his heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, like Canada, do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spend three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Chinon castle in the Valley of Loire?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that heritage protection is part of the culture of Americans and that it must be protected by all citizens, elected and all government departments, and so on in concert.
In Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 companies of history, heritage, archives and genealogies are concerned about exploring history, preserving with three of them private archives and preserving archaeological sites.
It is they who are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers launch their bulldozers against our forgotten old stones and tombs.
When is a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in a situation of distress following the impact of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalising it.The three countries support, up to EUR 11.2 billion, this financial and insurance institution also has interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and the Netherlands governments agreed, at the highest level, on this matter, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission to compete.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been expanding for more than a year is for the Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will purchase almost half (up to 49 per cent) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank is undoubtedly going to sell part of its stakes, including, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis actions started a vertigo fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let it go to bankruptcy.
On Friday, the company's shares dropped by 12 percent to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, the shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the company's leaders, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the non-Atlantic uncertainty, in connection with the adoption of the U.S. $700 billion rescue plan, of being the source of the fall in Fortis actions.
Monday, the papers have already received a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank, as the new director general.
The financial agency was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, and would not lose their money.
No panic has been felt in the bank's customer circle and no agency has been arrested.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A kidney in the chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information about their purchases of medicines.
Information protection experts fear that the data market becomes uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information on the prescription of medicines, in all cases, to the agreement of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be between independent hands, otherwise it will be entrusted to a kidney" - recalled Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage drug prescriptions in Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the insurance capital in case of damage, the health status of the customer present, and if they consider that the risk is too high, they do not even ensure it.
In the past, they sent candidates to a medical examination, and they signed insurance contracts with them only after learning about the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, it is easily supplied to pharmaceuticals, data on the purchases of medicinal products by the person in the past 18 months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers and what his health condition is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high fat rate in the blood, which immediately puts him in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. At the same time, some determine a risk factor, so there is no greater thing to do to the insurer than paperasse. However, minor problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program are the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat bubbles, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers to be aggravating risk factor, while the others do not.
Companies have developed data research and analysis, and they must request the patient's authorisation before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
In the meantime, they are forced by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their shortcomings in the past.
Since recently, some companies have also dealt with the results of laboratory analyses and relate them to the data on drug use, and thus they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use becomes increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the extension of the control circle of the authorities for companies specialized in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he developed even more ahead of his program, which would require the transmission of data to the individual's exclusive agreement.
Another question is whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent, since if he or she refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with her.
Thus and finally, chickens depend on the welfare of the kidney.
The Marseille Global Menu
The European Union and India multiply by two their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit next to other issues, largely global.
Today, there will also be a summit in France-India where there will be a particular issue of cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union acknowledged that India is a great democratic power that needs to be given a broader right of speech in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
They did not wait too long for this issue, yesterday, at this 9th summit organized in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Head of Diplomacy Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would multiply by two trades, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
In view of the fact that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods has risen from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an ambitious goal.
In this regard, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil aviation, and in this way air trade will also be able to take advantage of them in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and there was an urgent need for a United Nations conference on this.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been requested, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, including that it would like to reduce its toxic emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as on the need for a global market to pass at the climate conference scheduled for next year, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The head of state today goes to the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the press agency's information, the agreement would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
High presence of Italian publishers at the International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The International Book Hall of Frankfurt expects more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy 171,790 square metres of the Hall with more than 403 thousand exhibits, and Turkey as a guest of honor.
This will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the Italian Papillon's inauguration ceremony: Italy will be institutionally present with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a meeting with the press in the Room Struktur, in Papillon 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and perspectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors gradually decreases compared to the total Italian production, and in particular compared to that of adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying on the Nevada Desert, was found.
The debris was found on a surface at 3,000 metres high, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammont Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
Within the plane, however, no human remains.
The Sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, convinced the rest of the doubt: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that this is the one about which Steve Fossette was traveling the day he disappeared" he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found on either the plane or around.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered deceased.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a team of local investigators identified the device a few hours after the rescue of the sword: it was Bellanca 8kcab, missing on September 3, 2007, when Fosset decolla from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, money and a ticket.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he became in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had made the world tour by plane and without stairs.
Of all these records, the one that had stolen 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect.
A 4x4 outside the municipality of an original and well-defined design, on the marked lines, on the wide surfaces and net angles.
Here, in summary, Glk, the last birth of the "compact" off-road of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a new wind in this sector.
Just by its non-standard, unexpected and non-conventional content, the communication will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, starting on 17 October next.
Thus the advertising battle that will accompany the start of the new car will result in an unpublished mode of communication, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A maxi exhibition project, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, we'll have the impression that looking at the picture, the lucky car from the poster.
Then, through the use of the Remove8 innovative technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula in raising the interest of future buyers? We will see well.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy has been ashamed of now? They are part of the "Ultras Italy" group, which has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, has never created major problems.
He had never met with the adverse typhoids.
The group's extraction is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padoue, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (almost in reality) of Campania and Puilles were added.
They had three-coloured flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday night, they were all taken away to not be identified.
They're inspired by the English typhosery.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhosery of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available Italian typhos, 144 tickets for the part: all nominations, and therefore easily controlled.
And the Viminal had control over them all: among those who went to Sofia, none had a Daspo currently, none had been forbidden to attend a stage.
Four Italian typhois who had a history of stage crime did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal expects to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, the typhoids arrested or identified in the riots may spend at least five years on a Daspo.
An international Daspo banning the Italian but European stages.
In short, our hooligans will no longer stand at the stage.
Good luck.
But now is the time for fear-emulation: that is to say, others are at risk of adding to the hundred and fifty first.
"We must spread this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves this way," says Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes open especially for the match of the national team of Wednesday in Lecce"
In the Puilles there is indeed a small cloud of Italian Ultras supporters.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms, who can even rely on a section of Asia, that is, secret services, which are just dealing with stage problems.
"Duce-Duce Hearts, and the tendon arm during Mameli's hymen? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
Here is Domenico Mazzilli's opinion (expressed in a very unfavourable way) and recently, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a Prefect in Trieste, where he was a core supporter of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds observatory No.1 - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the event occurs.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see well what has happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about syllables against Mameli's hymen: they're not criminals either, but if you let me, they're not cops..."
