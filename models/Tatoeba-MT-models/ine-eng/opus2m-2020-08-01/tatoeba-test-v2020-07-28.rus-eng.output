I can't explain it to you.
He's afraid of dogs.
There were full girls at the party.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
How did you make an impression on Tom?
What does he hate me for?
Enough to get him mad.
He knows her from high school.
Tom made it look like nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
The accident didn't cost him his life.
He bought the bottle.
We're home.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you won't take me too seriously.
Why are you so secretive?
You're just running away from life's problems.
Find the snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I failed the exam.
Eat until it's hot.
That's why it took three hours.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks Maria's an idiot.
I said wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you'd come too.
Last week, I hit Boston on Tom.
Tom's beautiful.
Tom didn't know Mary likes to cook.
I said 'cause you're busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
You want the anecdote?
I wanted to do more.
Tom is our best pilot.
Are you sure you know what that means?
I can't just ignore him.
She's riding to a bicycle school.
I'll pay now!
Do you want to sit down for the roll?
I've been busy all day yesterday.
They're peers.
There's a coin on the table.
She's empty.
Help the window.
Don't think I didn't try.
You stay here.
Tom risked his life to save Mary.
Of the fifty camels, caravans drove uninhabitably through the desert.
You must be ashamed of your ignorance.
I've been swapping with Tom's places.
Tom went to the park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I won't try to convince you.
I knew Tom wouldn't miss it.
Tom told Mary he wanted to drink.
Why are you smiling?
Tom didn't say how he was going to get there.
Didn't I tell you that I'm allergic to peanuts?
I know how old you are.
I'm not going to show it to anyone anymore.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't want to make Tom bitter.
I'll teach you.
I have food.
He came to her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom tried to drown Mary.
I've decided to try again.
Tom won't let you win anymore.
The cosmonauts are wearing scarfs.
Algeria is buying artillery weapons in Russia.
Tell me 'cause what happened?
I'll give you something.
Why should Tom apologize?
The results were shocking.
This room is empty.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe this?
We were under the open sky.
Don't shut the door.
When are you free?
Didn't Tom have to do that on October 20th?
I have to go to work now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
The charge is one of five feelings.
What do you got?
They're afraid of him.
Tom at work.
Tom's hiding something from us.
He didn't even touch him.
Have you invented a name for a newborn?
I want you to help me with my homework.
I'm not a specialist.
I've been infected by him in a cold.
I like Brazil, but I'm still going to Ukraine.
I made you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.
I see Tom almost every day after school.
The horrific grave will be fixed.
Soup's so hot it can't be.
Why is she so popular?
They declared their innocence.
Where are you so hurt?
I don't think they're friends.
I made a deal with Tom.
I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I was expecting good news from them.
Distilled water is tasteless.
Father's in the garden now.
Harry's working part-time at the local supermarket.
It's very unlikely that I'm late.
I told them to be in the traps.
Tom said he was totally tired.
I used to dream of being a millionaire.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Tom's planning to break up with his girlfriend.
Where are you going tonight?
Tom closed the door to his bedroom.
I've known Tom for months.
You're useless!
Tom's playing very well on the script.
No one's accusing you.
Next year, Crolik.
Tom almost always takes the bath before dinner.
I can take you home.
What did you learn?
Please write down what I'm going to say.
Now I'm adding the last strokes.
I can't forget Tom.
I don't have a book.
Dennis is the only kind of sport Tom has.
Come to the castle.
Let me help you.
I was very awake, so I fell asleep at the time.
Tom is my favorite singer.
Remember, I love you.
He's a murderer, they say.
Mary didn't want to put on Halloween's open suit, so she decided to dress like a lady-amit.
Tom put up his hat.
Tom was waiting three hours.
Mary said she didn't want to drink.
You knew Tom better than I did.
Maybe people like us shouldn't have children.
I won't be.
I go shopping every morning.
The baby's pushing.
Tom refused to sign a document.
Tom didn't even stop.
I don't want Tom to go anywhere without me.
I've been watching how you're doing.
He's got great math skills.
Careful, on the way out.
He's the father of a newlywed.
Men were men then.
The Swiss banks are very secretive.
Once you finish your mission, you can drink as much as you think.
I'm the only one who can help you.
I hate winter.
What do you think Tom will say when he finds out?
Christmas is coming.
You want us to do this together?
All our attempts were in vain.
He poured himself another bottle.
Please be careful, I'm now starting to listen to the patient, make sure that the procedure has been properly implemented - you will have to use it tomorrow.
Please, salt.
She spent all her money.
Tom slept in the barn.
You'll take your eyes off.
Tom was tall for his age.
Did you notice what Mary's serious?
You're gonna be late for school again.
What's your favorite movie star?
So I didn't have to ask twice.
You need to go to Boston.
I was so excited.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I rarely see you and Tom.
I'm pretty tall.
From a practical point of view, there are many shortcomings in his plan.
This is the house I live in.
I'm going to school with him.
Your face says you don't agree.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I don't know what I mean.
I went to Harvard.
You're like an exported plastic.
I can't let him go.
It's Tom's window.
Jesus, allowing rage to enter the herd of pigs, demonstrated the unchanging nature of God’s Law about unclean animals.
I'm the captain.
I think we're gonna be okay.
We had to come.
I was wrong about that.
Today's my birthday.
We need to tell people what they need to do.
If she's not expensive, I'll buy her.
I told you what to do.
She didn't drown.
It was a good movie.
Are you a prom?
I'll never let you forget that.
Tom told me not to talk to you.
Who were you going to sell it to?
I don't want a divorce.
I grew up in Australia.
Tom gave his will to anger.
The missing boy was identified by his clothes.
I have good reflexes.
Tell me what it looked like.
She'll probably refuse to follow his advice because she doesn't like him.
Did you write?
I know you're working on them.
I hope I can help you.
Does your parents know about this?
The officer had a white skater on the table.
That day I stayed home because it was raining.
Is there a pharmacy around here?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why is Tom looking at me like that?
I called the police and told them that my car was stolen.
We can discuss this later.
It's a little helpful.
The bones in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak in public?
I work for an oil company.
Why don't you find someone else who needs your help?
Tom put a wet pillow on Mary's forehead.
He hurt his left hand.
Is she Italian?
We want to go.
The population of this city is declining every year.
Dan didn't want to be obnoxious.
Couldn't you tell me anything about yourself?
Did you find the difference between those two pictures?
I've never seen so many books gathered in one place.
You look a little depressed.
Don't forget to call me.
It's got a hearty tongue.
I would never do that.
Please fix it.
You need to add an ice-cream package to reduce the rest.
I could show you the city.
I know Tom's sick.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Take another stove.
I want to sleep!
You must be an idiot.
Tom in the park.
I didn't think you'd be here today.
"Who are you of nationality?" "Argentinians."
Why are you so sad?
I can do this a lot better than you.
Don't forget!
I really think so.
Zontic broke.
Tom brought his room in order.
Did you file a complaint?
I don't really like Tom.
So there's going to be a change of plans.
Someone tried him.
Do you want to know anything else?
Tom said he wanted to see us before he left.
But I don't have the money.
How's your new salary, Mary?
There was fear on his face.
If you don't tell her, I'll tell her.
Can you trust the secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
Tom told everyone that he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Get her somewhere.
I was just there when it happened.
Its origin is unknown.
Remember that.
Tom wakes up from a deep sleep.
You're big.
Where did you see him?
I don't know why you want me to do it.
I hope I see him Monday.
Are you sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
There's no girl on the Internet.
They'll find you.
I'm trying to figure out why this happened.
We'll send them an open door.
If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
Look to the left and the right before crossing the road.
Tom was my friend.
I didn't know her then.
We've heard these promises before.
What did you and Tom do after dinner?
I'm very unhappy.
As often happens, today Mike is late for the meeting.
Tom told me Mary had a new boyfriend.
We won't let that happen.
These fools violated the law prohibiting the violation of the law.
It's not done yet.
John spoke so loud that I heard him on the second floor.
Tom checked his vision.
I didn't give it to him.
It's weird.
I know you're rich.
Bill put a hundred dollars on a trip.
He served in the fleet.
Who taught you how to dance?
Tom had his nose pierced.
I wouldn't be surprised.
I don't swear.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I'm not going to waltz.
He moved into the car and drove away.
So tell me about everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do my homework.
It's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We still don't know the side effects of this medicine.
Tom's got teeth for three days.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies last.
This is the girl who came here yesterday.
I'll give you a new one.
You kind of said it was yours.
Where did he buy these bottles?
Don't make me do this.
Why did you smile?
Tom usually goes to work on the bus.
Fadel went to school.
I've been working with Tom before.
Tom and I are partners on the team.
Leave him alone!
My heart fights more and more every time I see her.
Do I think so?
Everyone else, except Tom, has pencils.
She gives him everything he asks.
Is that sold?
I'm getting worse.
Do you have such a big one?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
It just exacerbates the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a washbasin in the toilet.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're gone.
Can we take your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw that Jesse was standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's some sugar in the package.
That's what I did when I was a kid.
Something really good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't get involved in other people's affairs.
Who's in the blue football?
Tom's American accent.
I don't have the money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
The carrot is good for the eye.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She kept herself married.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom took care of it.
It's the third time.
Left strong.
I had to make sure he was coming.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy's fixed the trap.
Maybe we should go for a walk?
He's capable of math.
I'm glad you told me about her.
He's afraid of basketball.
I heard you're playing a good bando.
Did you read them?
I said 'cause I'm not gonna help him.
Tom's sorry he left Boston.
I don't like this store.
Tom speaks French in a horrible way.
I don't remember how much I paid for it anymore.
You're not eating with us?
Tom lives in Australia with his wife and three children.
I could barely sit on the train.
I don't like to argue.
You like science fiction movies?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to get up.
His house behind the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
What a lunch!
Mary, are you in a good shape now?
I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 arrests.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave birth to him, she poured a bottle of wine through him and took a strong step out of the restaurant, and the dead silence melted.
You're two years old, Tom.
We've met them.
Tom's gonna make the speech look good tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll need a loan.
Tom's father, who's in prison, never writes Why.
It's expensive.
I haven't heard from him in a hundred years.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought we all had a long time to meet.
Everyone is interested in Japan.
Tom's getting out of here very easily.
Please, just do everything I can.
Stay there.
I don't agree with him.
That's what it's called luck.
It was so dark in the room that I had to take a nap.
How many U.S. Air Force personnel?
She's your teacher?
Put it back together, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom realizes he doesn't need it anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in the hills of winter.
I own French.
If it sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where he found it.
Tom had to tell Mary.
Why is everyone looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all looks so weird.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.
How long are you sleeping?
Get the trash out.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you buy some candles?
Canada is a hockey family on ice.
The brain is a very complex organ.
They'd agree.
Your Japanese good.
Went through the window.
Spiders are disgusting little things.
I want to know where it is.
Kiss with no mouth like a saltless soup.
Did you try to talk to him?
Where are the other prisoners?
That's all that's happened today.
I saw the car hit a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom worked with Mary.
I'm tired of dying.
Do you know what your kids are doing now?
Do you want her to stay?
He misses her.
Please tell me I'm right.
We saw a castle in front of us.
Tom kept hitting her.
Six goes in front of the family.
Today I went to my grandfather's grave.
Tom couldn't believe someone was trying to kill him.
Tom didn't dance with Mary.
I saw the man who came from the garbage dump yesterday.
I think Tom was kidding me.
She took me under her wing.
Tom and Maria stopped laughing when they noticed John crying.
I have to meet Tom.
Tom lost his thumb.
Did you sign the contract?
I said 'cause he needs to talk to a lawyer.
They didn't sit on that bus again?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of company.
The area has changed completely.
Tom is an anti-Semitic.
What is your strongest side?
Tom doesn't like it when he's pushed.
Interestingly, when Angelica Agurbash sang a song on the words of Nekleev, could she imagine that he was going to fight in the presidents?
There's yogurt in the fridge.
Can you tell us what's going on?
Tom always speaks out loud.
The Foma must be there by two thirty.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he was very tired.
Tom wasn't in his room?
Why aren't you looking for him?
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
I wouldn't want anything better.
Tom wants a popcorn.
My favorite restaurant burned.
He's making a lot of mistakes.
Tom took an interview with Mary.
Tom is my personal assistant.
Who's this guy?
Keep children away from the crowd.
Let's talk about it tonight.
I have to do this.
They don't know French.
Let's go!
I knew what Jacksons were doing.
You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one granddaughter and three granddaughters.
He wants peanut butter.
That's how it works for you.
Tom's getting a little drunk.
I barely got it.
He ran away from the hostages.
You can live in a large house and still not feel lonely.
I expect Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
Red better.
The universe is infinite.
I'm not ready to do this yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you mean?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have Tom for a few words?
Don't make a noise like that.
When was Tom arrested?
We're leaving at 6:00.
The ostrich has become a victim of lions.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try to get her to help us.
Are you with us?
Smash your wish.
Tom's alive.
It can be in the water for ten years, but it won't be a crocodile.
Tom made it look like he didn't understand that Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw how it happened.
I don't think there's any other reason than that.
I'm very happy now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How do you always get it to be so energetic?
Put your signature here.
What an ego!
So you bought it?
A man is as old as he feels, and a woman as she looks.
Wisdom comes with age.
Do you remember what you told me?
There was a lot of snow last year.
He tried to cross the river.
Everything seems pretty good.
Tom told Mary to tell the truth.
You don't want another daughter?
I like playing along the river.
You can come with me.
This dictionary is a great gift for us.
"How much before dinner?" "Five minutes."
Tell her.
Mary spent all her time at work.
Tom moved on to his motorcycle and took him.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I've been waiting for him until ten.
Tom usually says the first thing he's got in his head.
Why do you want to leave?
How's French going to be "bye"?
It wasn't worth it.
What about the computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not going to fire you.
You really think Tom can swim?
How are you going to spend so much money?
Mary likes to hang out with bad guys.
They often say that they disappear in one language each week in the world.
She has a little advantage.
I thought we were talking about it.
I wish my parents were bitter if I had failed.
I feed the basket every morning and night.
Hold your tongue, you won't get it.
You must take into account all the consequences before you make any changes to the existing code.
I don't have any teeth.
I think you did great.
Last night we had a strong rain.
What did Tom bring?
That's exactly what I was looking for.
Tom noticed that the door was open.
That's when I hurt her ass.
I'd rather say something about him.
What choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Go home early, Bill.
She was sitting on a chair and reading the magazine.
Since then, it has been prohibited to cry.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
Here's the house where he lived.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to the monkey.
Eat my chocolate? Don't even think!
Beautiful in white, the house looks more like it.
I've had a hard time finding an original quote.
I had no idea you knew her.
What's the point of doing this?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give it more time.
You didn't tell me Tom spoke French.
Tom's coming back to Boston next week.
Why don't you help me?
I watched a movie in French with English subtitles.
I'll have lunch.
I think Tom was playing well.
He only blames others, and he never blames himself.
Do you know how to play gang?
Tom came to Mary and hugged her.
"When are you coming back?" "It depends on the weather."
How many turtles do they live?
How safe is it?
Your message has been received.
It took me three years to complete my house.
I was upset.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do it.
Tom didn't want us to attend his party.
I suddenly realized what was happening.
She said she was late.
Your parents still live in Germany?
I need her today.
Tom's probably winning.
What would you like Santa to bring you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your spirit of the wanton adventure?
What are you mad at me for?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've met.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.
The captain ordered his men to shoot.
Sit there.
He hasn't done it yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom's asked for my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, to think like a man, to act like a lady, to look like a girl and to work like a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I couldn't.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
Sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy this.
I've never seen you in a hat before.
Put it on the pole.
I thought you found someone else.
There is always a huge number of vehicles on this road.
You fooled us all.
I don't think Tom has brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
It's foolish to pretend that you make me believe that I believe in what you don't believe!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I was mistaken.
I appreciate your support.
You think that's possible?
In the end, he got sick.
You think Tom's locked up?
If that's true, it's better for me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom, he doesn't seem to know you.
I refuse to help him.
Can I sit with her?
Leave him alone.
Are you reading anything but the Bible?
Read me the testimony of the reader in the cat.
What does this gentleman do for his life?
Why do you think that's why you like it?
Is that what your parents know?
Is that what they're talking about?
Tom is waiting for you at the conference room.
The main thing in Tatoebe is not to say thoughts above the stomach and below the knees.
He paid him four dollars.
I had to cancel my trip because of the strikes.
I don't know your name.
How many trains are coming to Boston?
What are the words for this song?
Mary likes to piss off her brother.
The law on my side.
So we had to find where he lived.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was entrusted to the day of the professor's birth.
Your phone called a few times while you were in your heart.
She married him for money.
Not any bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just superstition.
Tom must make his own decisions.
Count it, please.
Your shoes must always be clean.
You've got your birthday soon.
Take a look.
I don't like those boots.
Tom's been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I jumped on the Internet.
I think that's why less than thirty.
Have you been drinking?
He certainly is the best fit for this work.
You're making it easier for me.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I love it.
It doesn't seem like you're too busy.
Delline's gone.
You look a lot like me.
Do you know those men?
Tom left the room, didn't tell anyone a word.
That probably didn't happen.
Are you done?
Tom and Mary talked for no less than an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He tried to save her.
If you press this button, the door will open.
How much do you need?
I'm back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Did you hear the last rumors?
I'd show you how it's done.
I asked Tom to come.
You've got a cake.
Mom taught me not to waste money.
We could walk.
She ended up last night in the middle of the afternoon.
I can't grow our daughter alone.
He took my place.
I wanted to talk about it.
I yelled for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know it's important to you.
They all knew her.
We'd better stop.
I'm not gonna be late anymore.
I'm so hungry.
I live close enough for you.
Tom's running behind the horses.
Why wouldn't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
People usually die if they're killed.
They turned Tom off the life-saving device.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
Excuse me for my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom's got two of you.
Tom closed the lid.
I'm marrying a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is heat that can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you first say that?
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
He wouldn't dare do that.
A 12-hour trip had me wrong.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who's the boss of this company?
No one's seen how we did it.
He came back two days later.
Tom was in the morning.
We need to be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary have been asked.
Ed!
That's why you helped wash the window?
It's out of my jurisdiction.
That was yesterday.
I'm starting to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm not here.
Don't tell me because what really happened.
I'm not just gonna give you this.
What are you gonna say?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Get down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends these openings.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I threw the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read this book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this photo?
Tom gave me both money and advice.
What do you want to hear from me?
Please open the door.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
She married him at the age of 20.
I can't give anyone that dictionary.
Give me that box.
They say his father died in a foreign country.
Take mine.
I know Tom's above Mary.
I didn't have time to do this today.
Mary said 'cause she'll help him.
A multitude of “person” — “people”, not “persons”.
It's in two steps.
You've done it!
I think that's why we had to stay in Boston.
Did you invite him?
Tom told me his name was little.
Tom thinks I'm in Boston now.
Tom didn't want to buy a new car.
We're teachers.
Tom will find you.
Everyone has weaknesses.
I hope you're well paid.
Tom didn't eat meat at all.
This book seemed interesting to me.
Hundreds of unemployed sleep there day and night.
I guess I'll be late.
Your kids know French?
Tom yelled and ran out of the room.
This soup gives you fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
Didn't you know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to make time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among people, spoke in a horrible, Jewish way, the Galilean dialect of Aramaic rather than Hebrew, thus showing the inability of allegations of the existence of any sacred language that is used in prayer especially close to God.
Tom thought about it.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
That's why they paid $300.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
Weather forecast failed.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to prepare you something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't wear a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him sing in his soul.
You remind me of my young man.
Tonight, Tom's on duty.
I'm always busy.
I'm playing for the piano.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom got up fast.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in his room.
The rest is important.
Have you called Lucy yet?
Good idea came to her head at the last minute.
In this room there's a very slender air.
Why aren't you on the guitar today?
Pound is a unit of weight.
I wouldn't talk to him if I were you.
Japan consumes a lot of paper.
It's very difficult.
You betrayed me.
Tell her I'm sick.
Tom seems to be busy.
And I'm so glad to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help it.
Is this my book?
It's a routine job.
Who else do you have on the list?
So don't give me my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I'd like to know what to tell them.
Toma's kids must be bored.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He hid this fact from me.
Did you save me?
He horribly spattered in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom knew Mary by the voice.
You don't even look at me.
Tom's too lazy to do this.
Please stop messing around.
Grandpa always said there would be days like today.
I didn't tell her that.
I want to live in Australia.
No one could help them.
When did you meet her?
The day has come to an end, and thanks to your timely efforts, the people who tried to help you in your work have failed to put themselves at risk.
After the earthquake, many decided to sleep in the living quarters on the street.

We both laughed.
We need three more chairs.
I like this office.
I have a friend who lives in England.
Tom's trying his best.
Why don't you go tomorrow?
We should get to know each other better.
Someone said something, but I didn't understand.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to reach the hospital on his own.
I sat next to Tom.
Your voice is upset.
You've always been so selfish?
I think this medicine will be of great benefit to you.
Tell him to be here by the third half.
It's not a God of science.
Tom suspected that Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
You want a beer?
Where'd you see him?
The poor cat was on the verge of starving.
I've learned so much about my mistakes that I'm going to do a few more!
My favorite color is blue.
I've made some corrections.
You don't know what you're talking about.
The football player hit the ball.
It's a good book for sale.
Tom didn't say anything.
I didn't know Tom wouldn't do that.

You're so wrong!

Everyone looked at my feet.

Don't help me!
I'm not well.
Come to me.

I'm out of fashion.
Tom's allergic.
I know this girl's father.
I don't know exactly what my kids want for Christmas.
Why did she do that?
Tom's got it?
I finally got to work.
Tom at the kitchen, the dishes.
The temperature dropped to three degrees.
Tom refused to let Mary go to the party.
Tom won't ask me to do that.
I want to be like him.
I'll never tell you.
The bus was full.
Where do you want to go to the next exit?
How great is that?
I'm tired.
Tom wasn't hanging out with Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car is a good sale.
I need to work on these exits.
You can't deal with us like that.
His words upset me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know that's why I had to.
Give her my regards.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer is everyone's shaking.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom in answer?
It's time for me to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
Peace is cruel.
I've got a good dream.
So no one is responsible for anything except himself.
I'm from Sydzuoka.
Tom slept in his backyard all the trees.
Saturday is the day when he's free.
It's interesting what happened to her.
The last bus leaves in 30 minutes.
He told me he'd do it.
He gave him a book.
Thank you so much for staying with me.
She didn't give me anything.
I understand.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm happy for what it is.
What's the matter with you?
E-mail's a mile.
I want to know if Tom and Mary eat meat.
Tom wouldn't listen to my advice.
You want to say something about why?
You don't want another son?

I think we should tell 'cause we're late.
Where are our friends?
Don't forget us.
They tried to hide their concerns.
There's a big organ in this assembly.
I don't think you're right.
Did you find him?
You want me to come in?
Please put me on this side of the lighthouse.
Tom shot and killed a tiger.
I've never met anyone before.
How much does it cost?
I want something cold to drink.
What difference do you make?
Each nation has its own special character.
A healthy person does not know the price of health.
Did I miss something interesting?
I had to tell them myself.
The audience laughed.
You don't pay attention to me.
I've got a broken bed.
You like to take pictures, don't you?
He's a noble knight with no fear.
They hate women.
I don't have any balls with me.
Tom was trying to escape.
What color does she have?
Go soon!
You're overestimating him.
How many weeks ago did this happen?
Tom slept in his room.
Do you know why this is happening?
I looked around.
Tom's still alive.
Hawaii is my favorite drink.
Tom was a hockey fan.
Who was here first?
You're eating in a chorus?
Were you home last night?
I've been homeless for three months.
She said she wanted to win.
The prices are going down.
I'm glad Tom didn't get hurt.
I never hurt anyone.
It wasn't an accident.
Don't blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom yells at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Do not leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom used to say that Mary from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very smart.
Once again and again, there are obstacles in our lives, some calling them problems, others talking about opportunities for growth.
Thanks for taking him fishing.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
He told me he wanted to leave the company.
You want to come in?
You and I both know it's not gonna happen.
I thought you knew them.
Tom bought me a hot dog.
I'll be back late.
We need action, not words.
Tom was suspected of being a spy.
You're just running away from the problem.
Court without women like a garden without flowers.
You can't leave a kid alone.
She'll do it if she can.
I'm done with it.
I've put on a hairdresser.
Don't leave your eyes on the table!
We sold our souls for money.
Are you working tonight?
The wind blew.
I rarely met her.
I know it's really important.
I eat apples.

I'm not hungry.
Their job is to prepare food for the soldiers.

I can put things in the box.
I'm going to put order in your bedroom today.
He has five languages.
Tom had a simple childhood.
I'm divorced.
How did you know Tom was sick?
I like the way you pronounce my name.
Tom didn't tell me anything.
There's no high-class boys like Bill.
Shall we go?
I knew you could handle it!
Tom got the wood in the fire.
"Love never killed anyone." "Didn't it? Ask Romeo and Juliet."
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It looks like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I couldn't let her go.
Tom died half a year ago.
I knew you were coming back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving?
Neither Tom nor Mary were ever in Boston.
Have you ever heard of it?
If I had the money, I'd buy a computer.
Tom's smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom's in school right now?
Please, let us know.
Tom sneezed and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in my room.
Do you have any pain?
He couldn't leave because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door, or we'll break it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't be able to speak French.
I think that's why you can trust me.
There are many mysteries in life.
Isn't it too salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's a rotten apple.
Tom said he had no money.
Boston is Tom’s favorite city.
I'm sorry when someone dies.
Are you feeling better?
What makes you think it might interest us?
I'll think about you every day until I'm gone.
That was a bad rate.
Thought she was going alone, worried me.
The river flows moderately.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I've been watching them.
Do you really love her?
He presented the facts without commenting.
He was dark-green.
He'll definitely come.
Is there a message?
He called me suddenly yesterday.
We really need that.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the bottles.
I decided to give up.
An accident has chosen their only son.
Everyone knows there's something new in this old capital.
I'm always careful.
I went to the market.
Did you bring the half-breed?
Tell me 'cause I have his keys.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Do we have a chance to win?
I knew I had to stay home.
He understands more French.
Tom lived on a bus going to Boston.
And then she slipped the bow.
I'm sick.
We'll meet Tom later.
You want to be rich?
They're calling you.
I'm proud of you.
She doesn't like my manner of speaking.
Mary wants another baby.
I don't care what you do with your money.
I'd like to see the boss.
Tom didn't drive to Boston.
Weather forecast can't be expected at all.
She's still young.
Have you listened to Tom's advice?
Tom said he was a Dalton.
How's your father?
They said when?
This car looks angry.
Are you studying English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money on a new salary.
Why does the moon shine at night?
I couldn't understand what Tom was saying.
You won't need it anymore.
Tom did it especially.
Let's think about it.
I know Tom wants you to do it.
Tom said he didn't know anything about the robbery.
Are you familiar with everyone here?
Tom could not read until he was thirteen years old.
I'd rather have some eggs.
She lives in Muhosranska.
Those people that don't know me, I don't care.
Is this your first trip to Australia?
They are wise.
Tom asked for some water.
The player went with the brake in all three sets he gave him.
I can't go with you because I'm busy.

What's he talking about?
I haven't seen Tom in a long time.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
What floor does Tom live on?
There are no direct trips to Bologna.
I live outside the city.
Give me a few hours.
Don't force yourself to eat if you don't want to.
I have a warrant for Tom.
"How did the accident happen?" "No one knows."
What do you like about it?
When I came to the station, I called my friend.
I need to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.
Tom got rid of his foreign accent.
We all knew it would happen sooner or later.
No one has made any disagreements.
She's running.
He's a man.
If you were an Icelandic color, I think he'd be white.
Do you know where the meeting is going?
I wish they were happy.
I want to ask for work.
Many followers of Christianity.
Covers are clouding.
Tom told me it's impossible.
It must be where Tom lives.
Tom's a weird kid.
The phone was invented by Bell in 1876.
I fell asleep on his shoulder.
I know you work a lot.
I love Ural languages.
I hope that's what you're wrong with.
At times, we need to speak the truth.
Tom, he's a hard worker.
I've got an offer for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are planning on getting married on 20 October.
If you want to be alone, I'll go.
He's got a lot of talent.
He's in a bad mood.
What would you like to be called?
He's got a Japanese father.
Who would want to kill him?
I was in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was tired.
He's sitting up until late at night.
Tom's room is very small.
You speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
This song is dedicated to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we can do.
I'm proud of them.
I just got home.
Tom burns in his oven both wood and coal.
My eyes are hurting.
I love stories.
We must be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom left Mary his keys.
I'm talking to him all the time.
I can't laugh at her butts.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foresaw the reconciliation between the royal authority and the priesthood in Jesus Christ.
You want me to talk to Tom myself?
Each of us went home.
It's not thin, but it's strong and it's not moving.
It's all a little stupid.
I don't know what I want right now.
That's amazing.
I don't think you sent me that order.
Six or five for TV viewers!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom's interested in biology.
She was trying to kill him.
Was he really that bad?
Please tell me where you're going to live.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one's seen you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we get Tom?
Tom said I wasn't beautiful.
Do you often cry?
We did not expect such results.
I've already read it.
If the car breaks down, we'll walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Did you find anything interesting?
They're all doing it.
I often visit relatives.
He'll be expelled from our club.
You have to be punished for what you did.
They went up the stairs.
She has to drink water.
It's one of the most ugly buildings I've ever seen.

That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My old table.
We're both very busy.
It's invisible.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll follow you.
Tom tried to drown in the furnace.
Tom and I are growing up.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Maria’s younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes playing cards.
The book's big.
Don't talk about Tom like that.
I kind of made it clear.
We've been waiting three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Time may change, but human nature is the same.
Tom looks pretty upset.
I brought the stove.
The following year Tom will teach French.
I've heard it all.
I advised you to take a break.
Why is that bothering you?
The worst part of the trip is in the back.
We're not gonna catch you both.
Don't be so stubborn!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do this!
This knife was very good for me.
How did you know I had it?
You're gonna have a minute.
I would very much like to change this situation.
We've taken care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They won't come back.
You shouldn't trust any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a white in a wheel.
He didn't.
Don't you want to come with us?
Does Tom have the ability to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We plan to leave as soon as possible.
He was going to jump on Hokkaido's spoons.
"Shoot your music and read the book." "I see my censorship still working."
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did this without you.
You have blood coming out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants the same thing you want.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where's the near supermarket?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't know Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you are lying, join in.
Tom wanted to apologize again to Mary.
Tom was thinking.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He's never been.
I really want to go with you, but I can't.
It's never been like that before.
I wasn't gonna do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Let's go fast, and you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary changed places.
How do they get you out?
Where are you going to live?
Usually I'm a peaceful man, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is under threat.
Mary sewed Alice a new plate.
That decision was difficult to make.
I thought you guys wanted to drink.
I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
So I didn't have to leave.
Mary was healed after her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
Eating meat is harmful to your health and the environment.
You're telling me you don't know anything about it?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom can't get pleasure from his life.
I want you to say a word for me.
I don't like anyone.
I'm sorry I don't know Tom's phone.
"It's on course." "Yes, you told him?" "No, he knew everything."
Your explanation was very understandable.
I missed the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you've just thought about something.
Sugar is the world's largest source of drinking.
What do you like most in Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for the signal to begin.
I told them not to talk to anyone.
There's a lot we need to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is crying.
I don't have this book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is in the center of the solar system.
You're a cop?
Tom cheated on me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I've cut my bristles.
Tom and Mary seem more than just friends.
The river's ruined now.
A strong wind shut up at night.
The ants and giraffes are distant relatives.
Tom did it because I told him so.
I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom's got two cadres.
Tom didn't seem to know me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Don't worry.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I'm used to lying down early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom in the office.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious dish I've ever eaten.
I had a lot of trouble with the parking lot.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
She's not mine.
You know what that is?
From then on, the capital of Canada.
Tom was never late for school.
Why are you so direct?
Go to your father's and ask him.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each letter.
It's hard for you to take seriously.
Members of this tribe moved along the river.
I'll do it.
I said let them go.
When did it start?
No one's got a problem before she thinks.
I don't think that's weird.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom gave."
When are you gonna get the wheat?
Tom told Mary that he was willing to do it.
Does it make sense to do that?
Why are you closing the door?
Tom said he tried to do it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You can't write programs.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's not tall, but strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Come on, please, Tom.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is unclear.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
You don't understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom married Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
This box is carrying a ton.
He gets it because he's a jockey.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he never met her.
He said he was going to kiss me.
Don't worry about me.
Are you happy?
It's not gonna happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
It's our school.
I was free all day yesterday, and I'm working today.
Take your coat.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a terrible man!
Carton's got hard papers.
Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your authority.
The curse was broken.
Praded Tom was born blind.
Tom's better than you, isn't he?
She hurt her back while playing tennis.
Tom's scared.
This table is white.
It was a weird game.
I've heard about all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm going with you to Boston.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer they went to a mountain resort.
Won't you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary aren't afraid.
Can you come any closer?
She's light-headed.
What actions do you expect from Tom?
She seemed quite calm.
Push the button.
Tom and Mary went to the museum.
Tom was intrigued by what was happening.
Mary was carrying the mushrooms to her knees.
It's a lie.
I'll follow them.
She said she was cold.
The road inspector was extremely rude.
Tom wants to go on his father's feet.
I don't see any problem here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's awfully bad.
Tom told you where he was last night?
I can improve you on your way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Last time Tom was the first.
It's different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put the tree out there.
You usually wear a bike helmet?
Tom's gonna do it.
Tom said goodbye to his sister.
Mother was busy cooking.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
It's a little bit of a long sleeve.
Tom was in the sandals.
There's a rock underneath the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How's my story?
Tom shut down the building and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked up.
I heard you sing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
Tom often plays guitars.
I was trying to warn Tom.
The train was full.
Tom rarely wears a tie.
You bought too much bread.
He says he's not planning on going.
I have two dogs, three cats and six shoes.
Tom's got a cable?
Whatever you say, I won't change my mind.
Tom can talk.
Thank him for his help.
Tom could tell me.
This will bring disaster to your family.
I was very nervous.
Tom said I had to go.
I have to win.
It's useless to ask him for help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You should try not to sleep.
Mom's really helping me.
Tom's got a snake on his back.
Did you buy meat in the supermarket?

I know you don't like me.
The police found Tom dead on his wing.
I'm not as lucky as you.
I did everything you asked me to.
Are you planning on buying a house?
On the cat table.

At times, a small gift may be an expression of great love.

That's why I didn't like the movie.
You want us to help you?
Be realistic.
Tom was planning on having a party.
I'll call someone for help.
Why didn't you tell us earlier?
Is it Chinese or Japanese?
Burn it.
I'm doing my best.
You're pale as a ghost.
I'll be home by 6:00.
The French isn't that complicated.
Let's get out of the cab.
He was sitting.

I suggest you do this today.

We think so too.
How could something like that happen?
You're an actress.

I forgot to ask.
I always have my hands and feet.
How can I translate words that are not in any language other than mine?
Could you put that on the tape?
I'll go home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.

I need you to do this right now.

I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to write.
You'll be safe there.
I'm in Tehran.
"You speak Greek?" "Not yet, this is my first lesson!"
Why did you give him the money?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
You went to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do this more.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you arrange for her?
I've been to Sapporo.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll try our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's gonna be late for the plane.
She always gets up early.
You want her to help you?
You eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the deepest auditorium.
You will survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When do we have a woman as president?
He's here to see you.
I'm glad Tom did this.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is not far from our school.
It's hot. I'm hot for you.
England looks like Japan in many ways.
Tom would never do that.
I suggest you try harder.
This dog doesn't scare a kid.
Don't resist.

It's a deal.
Tom is very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What about Tom?
I hope you don't get cold.
He's shot at the bird.
Tom's off Monday.
Come on!
I need to move on.
She swallowed her nose to the glass.
There is no difference in English between the words "sir" and "sir".
I know exactly what to do.
He's very secretive.
You have an excellent English.
Do I have any messages?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Writing text, driving a car, very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agrees.
Tom said Mary won't win.
Why'd you take off your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many lunches do you have?
The black villa was broken.
Why don't you go kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Fom to stop?
You swore you'd love me.
I don't want Tom to think he has to explain to me.
I was very calm.
Everybody's got something to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice will still ring in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time is treating everything.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw it on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't drop the case.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?
Some birds didn't fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I said 'cause you came to Australia.
Were you looking for that?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where am I waiting for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were hit by a snowstorm.
Book on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What are we gonna lose?
You'd better ask him first.
He was fired against the will.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his tube?
She didn't answer his letter anyway.
I hired someone today.
Stop kicking the fool!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm on the stairs.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do that.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I've already done it.
What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You're not gonna introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was willing to do it.
She cried.
I said 'cause Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living around the city?
How long have you been here?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm the leader of Tom.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone yelled.
What better?
We thank you for your help.
Go to your room!
That's not why I told him to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train's going to three thirty.
I know you're hiding something.
Get the beast out of the cell.
He's afraid of basketball.
You look like a father.
George's five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as they told you.
Please take a look at this movie.
Somebody's calling.
I ran away.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't fall in love with your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're way above Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on his son's birth.
Mary says she needs more time.
Foma got out of the door.
My father is an English teacher.
On Christmas, Tom and Mary gave their granddaughter a bicycle.
Hold on to the laundry.
Is that what you did?

Maybe.

We have to help.
Tom just got out of jail.
Did you tell So?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your grandfather think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've made a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know what you'd do for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only in philosophy can a vicious circle be used in evidence and be highly valued for this.
I can't afford to have children.
When I spoke to them in French in Paris, they only laughed at me, and I couldn't get these Bolts to understand their own language.
Shall I go?
I was so stupid that I believed in it.
She did.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
It's been ten hours.
White bread, please.
It's sweet.
Tom is illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We're perfect for each other.
French is complicated, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger was gone.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was upset.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must've missed her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris away?
How much time now in Tokyo?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we said.
Frida Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming today.
You'll be a father, you'll get it.
Last Monday I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think Christmas snow will be this year?
How was Tom's party?
I need a toilet.
I owe one of my friends a tent.
I'll work for you if you pay me as well.
I'd like to have a cup of coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth in a while.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have a second chance.
He immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All accounts have to be paid to me.
She's stuck.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom's taking care of Mary's hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom has regular sushi with his mother.
We forgot to register!
Tom said he likes it here.
No, I'm not tired.
She's the most lazy of those I know.
Mary's already gone to her room?
This time I'll forgive him.
I like Chinese food very much.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a vigilante.
Alvaro from Venezuela.
That's the count.
He insulted me in public.
Tom won't win anymore.
Why don't I stay with you?
Magnets are used in induction plates for direct heating.
I cried.
Tom wants to learn how to play trombone.
Get out of here right now.
May I take a look at your rights?
I'll take 1,000 peas to replace the molar on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot the script.
Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly what to start with.
That's the memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom's got the shit.
He wrote a few letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in pajamas?
How much is that worth?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
A glass of quality weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I had to leave a note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger, Tom.
I've been waiting for Tom since the third half.
He likes it.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary are doing this together.
Did anyone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's good.
She played the sonata.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba all languages are equal.
The infection got into the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a gift.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
You'll ever thank me.
Tom's watching TV sometimes.
Am I ready?
I was waiting for you.
I'm still ill-imaged.
Run, you!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I just fell asleep two hours a night.
Mary had no desire.
So it wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom up.
They say it's very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late for heavy rain.
I guess she's healthy.
Tom was in a straw hat.
Take care of your little brother.
Tom said he wasn't waiting for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you eaten yet?
I like the bitter pepper.
How much do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain took the 1992 Olympics.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincibles.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
I know Tom can draw.
They're trapped.
I didn't know what it would be impossible to do.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You don't get Tom.
Did you die?
Does Tom know French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost one year old.
I was impressed.
I don't advise you to go.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defense.
How is faith different from trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you know?
If the weather permits, tomorrow we'll head to the top of the mountain.
We both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read the ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more complicated it seemed.
His gray eyes shined and disappeared, and his pale face usually relived and covered with a rhyme.
What kind of pizza do you like most?
Tom was standing before Mary.
Take more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands are cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
I find it hard to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed many homes.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom's still living in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I don't expect to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
The authority in Tom's hands.
I learned to deal and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
Nobody's gonna blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children like to play more than to learn.
He was accepted as his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess which language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of fear.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
I'm going!
Do it until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
Did your lips suddenly get into fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're bitter.
Last night, our granddaughter was born.
Tom's suit is a pirate.
It's the pure truth!
Let's go get the trigger.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't exactly remember what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom must be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she doesn't have to do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out.
We are proud of our achievements.
So Mary had to be invited.
Tom had to be punished.
You're adorable?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not the girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I eat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know that this man is the one for whom he betrays himself?
King Harald Gormsson, known as Harald Sinezubius, introduced Christianity into Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
That's where Tom could stay.
Almost all of them were dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been so hot.
He put on a black coat.
I forgot to puke flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't be in this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read German Gess.
Actually, I've never spoken Portuguese.
When criminal proceedings are brought before the court, it is generally accepted that there are twelve persons in the jury court.
What exactly did Tom do in the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I started meeting each other.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very busy.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acidic.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was going to do it.
There's another day gone by.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got orange tastes all over my hand.
Tom, come on, we're late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you following your weight?
Tom's playing trombone.
You from Tokyo?
I want her not to be in my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonalds is world famous for his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a precious gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like these spirits?
The castle is broken.
Diamond is a precious stone.
Have a good time, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Leave it, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom works as an officer.
Tonight's gonna be cold.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from self - esteem?
Was that too simple?
What Ellis faced, waiting for the answer, was a sudden war, it was so loud, so sharp to break her drums, and so loud to reach heaven.
I lost him in the crowd.
We talked about Jim when he went into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
That's why you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get things in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
Many books are published annually.
Tom was reluctant to give Mary the money she asked him for.
What do you hate her for?
My steering wheel broke.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I've been trying very hard to solve the problem.
You were supposed to do homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This rock was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why doesn't Tom sleep?
The way he wakes up, the way he responds.
We took the canoe.
Have you ever tasted banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom remarkable?
He's your teacher?
The rich sometimes look up at the poor.
I know what Tom is afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his belt.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your names.
The occupier went into the tree.
The language I learn is very difficult.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm getting married.
Are you really the only one alive?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom's my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We would like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President has been in charge for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Can't you solve that question?
Both Tom and Mary are here.
So what would you do with that?
Twenty floors in the building.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
Aren't you, by the way, on the way back to Tom?
I don't have a picture of Tom.
Can you wait a minute?
Are you going to give something for Christmas?
She won't let him go.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he were to follow my advice, then he would now be a rich man.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
A strong wind rose.
Tom didn't have the guts to try to push the parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
How long are you planning to be home tonight?
I'm empty.
Do you feel normal?
He's just sitting there.
I think you can handle it.
She knew it wasn't right.
It's so cool!
Tom had the feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I came home, he watched TV.
Tom was talking last night in a dream.
Tom's ready to protect himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but I picked up some girl.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We must stick to the plan.
I'll tell you 'cause you called.
Tom's very strict with the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom was interested.
I'm mixing mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got a little bit of stuff.
Did you understand what she said?
You're kind of dissatisfied.
Don't hurt her.
I'd better stay.
That's why a brilliant idea came to mind.
She's breathing now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect that's why I have to go to Boston next week.
Don't go abroad.
Tom was terrified.
The face of Tom's beautified.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
You're afraid of your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
We need a new chair in the room.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of the crisis?
How long do you want to leave?
She had a leg sore.
It's a risk that we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to take you to the hospital.
Why is the square root of two?
Tom bowed in front and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom did it a lot.
I hope we don't do that anymore.
How many times have you helped to do this?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These precious things.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, there's an opening time.
I'm not sure what size she has.
He was also good to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the lighthouse and walked into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll eat as soon as the rain stops.
Foma left the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't think of Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary had been adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
We were crying with him.
Don't you want to try it again?
Wait till you hear it.
What did you break up for?
Oil, cheese, and much more can be made from milk.
You don't have the authority to do this.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
You're her relative?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her younger daughter.
Take care of yourself.
You like jazz?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like a stranger.
Are you popular?
The Russians won as much as they expected.
He sneezed in the answer.
Tom said Mary's enough.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You'll get it if you try.
You didn't mean to ask Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Couldn't you say this in human language?
Nobody's hungry except me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflake in the snowflake is considered guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom to be here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?

Payment will be made according to experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.

We checked.
Let's see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't.

I don't have as much money as you think.
I'm selling clothes on the Internet.
I could've done it faster when I was a kid.

I don't want to.
It's time to put the kids to sleep.

There's nothing.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take the medicine?
Many people believe in corruption among our country's officials.

That's what I found in the cave.

The train will be at this station for about two minutes.

In a big city like Tokyo, I prefer walking rather than driving.
As it turned out here, it's now impossible to know.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't know her first.
The majority of the votes were manufactured.
You lied to us, didn't you?

In the most beautiful colors are the sharpest spikes.
You better hide.
That's what I'm talking about.
It's just not gonna happen.
They can't afford it.
What colors do you like?
She says she feels very upset.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom escape?
Tom doesn't know what Iraq is different from Iran.
That's why they told themselves not to.
Two days ago, I caught a cold.
I was waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have a cup of coffee or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom, he'll tell you the same thing.
I saw that helicopter myself and I took it off.
I'm with you.
You want to end up like him?

Are you going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no air conditioning in my house.
Tom and Mary are studying French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his proposal.
I admire your courage.
Tom was hoping Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do this again.
Soon your turn, Bashar!
You're worthless.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
I'm sorry, couldn't you repeat the question?
What do you think they're gonna do to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary does.
I don't want anyone to.
Tom's gonna be working on these exits.
Give it to her, please, what I called.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The President ' s attempts to put in place more stringent arms control at once had been thwarted by powerful weapons lobbys.
I think we know each other.
You're underestimating Tom.
Don't worry, Tom.
I'll try to express it in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You've got enough time.
We had to plan more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud of my father being a good shot.
Anything else you want to tell me?
Foma tried to explain the situation of Masha.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
No one paid attention to me.
So there were thirteen at that time.
I'm going to Boston on a bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay in advance.
Did you make coffee?
You could tell the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Take a look at yourself.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
This is definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're more than Spartacus!
That's how he celebrated his birthday.
Why did he need it?
It's a capital investment.
It's really bad.
It didn't take time.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
It's a broadcast.
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've already read it.
It's thanks to you.
Until certain conditions are met.
She's not like everything.
Social networks provide a great deal of information about the person before he or she meets.
What really happened in the last exits in Boston?
What Does It Mean to Learn?
These peaches aren't very sweet.
I don't think these black fries can be pulled out.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay her.
I can't forgive his leashes.
Tell me you're shooting!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom was expelled from school.
Tom said he was very lonely.
I didn't tell my friends I was going to Australia.

Tom just wanted to make sure that's what you meant.
Tom sent his daughter to bed without dinner.
I'm coming with you.
They've cleared the street from the snow.
Tom and Mary have to do this together.
They offered us their help.
Tom was determined to kiss Masha.
Are you very hungry?
What's going to happen to him?
Tom and I are each other's friends.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You can't always win.
Tom's some kind of celebrity.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I've seen them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The painting is hanging on the wall.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Tom with you?
The boy is afraid of the dark.
That's why I made dinner.
Russia has become a second state.
I'm worried about them, too.
He went to the post office to send a letter.
Break this powder into a glass of water.
Are you going with her?
Let's take one of those ready lunches that are sold at the train station.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't accuse the government.
Put it in place.
How did you get to know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop the guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent per apartment in Manhattan is about $40,000 a month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only one who survived.
Are you going to buy this car?
You're talking like my grandmother.
I don't have any cousins.
Let's see something else.
Do you think this is a correct translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both really wanted to be there.
So there's nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't shut the door.
You should take his age into account.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
What if he's coming back now?
If you stop, you're asleep!
I'm afraid I don't have time.
Didn't you know that Mary was Tom's wife?
I need to move on.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
Friday we're going to lunch.
What's your dad's name?
You're not gonna turn the radio off?
I don't remember what Tom said.
Tom is an experienced player.
I wasn't ready for that.
Look at that girl.
Tom's got a vivid imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you talking about?
You left the bar yesterday just at the time I was going to put all the drinks on my account.
Tom told me it was really working.
I want to play chess.
I support you for a hundred percent.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
You have to tell her how you feel.
I have a mild headache.
I heard about what happened.
We rarely have snow here.
Don't open that box.
I hate to wait.
Sometimes I see him at the club.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
It was fun yesterday.
Where did Tom take those pictures?

He's been driving out of here in ten minutes.
Who are you to decide?
Take a look at the basket.

Get out of this room.
You don't have to smoke while you're working.

I'd like to talk to you alone.
I thought you weren't seeing him anymore.
This magazine is very well sold.
Her clothes attracted a lot of attention to the party.
They're getting married tomorrow.
She was right, and he wasn't right.
They've got the scratches they've got to go first.
Maybe we could ask him for a ride.
Luckily, it worked.

He gave dogs a piece of meat.
You have a letter.
Uncle Tom couldn't read.
I'm not a doctor. I'm a teacher.

She doesn't like the new job.
I didn't want my neighbors to see me naked.
The operation was successful.
Will Tom still be in the hospital for a long time?
I want you to stay with her.
I'll make him pay the money.
You must respect them.
I'm waiting for you in Turin!
You didn't look tired.
I'll pray hard.
What will you do if the war starts again?
Tom said he'd do the same.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
The most famous gold disease is the California gold disease, which began in 1848.
You know why Tom doesn't trust Mary?
Show me your photo.
I'll meet new people every day.
I want to go see him.
You cheated on Tom.
What are you doing in my room?
We miss you so much.
He answered his parents.
Tom, are you ready?
Who did you give it to?
I held him back.
Nobody's asking you to do this.
I forgot that this is April 1st.
Please stop singing this song!
Tom tasted the dog.
I know you left early.
Tom's been doing this all morning.
I'm aware of the consequences.
The eastern and western parts of the city are divided by the river.
Why are you coming?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
That's why it was scary?
Tom invited me to stay for the night.
I don't think Tom was guilty.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed by your French.
We both want to do it.
If the ice warms up, it grows.
We could have done that.
The doctor said that's why surgery is needed.
I've changed my toothpaste recently.
Here's something for you.
It's your bedroom.
Tom is realistic.
Who's going to knock at my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I came to visit you.
I feel like an amphibian.
Our team has returned home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I heard him.
Why don't you sleep?
He came to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you cry.
Show me how to do this!
Everybody's quiet.
Let the dust sink.
Why are you so stubborn?
He's got into his Chinese-language teacher, but with all these hormonal things, he's got into almost every meeting.
I'm glad to inform you that I've recovered completely.
I've written a lot of suggestions on the experiment.
I like the aquarium more than a paste.
I can't make any exceptions.
He's a quick figure.
I can find them.
I'm here now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't be too close to the TV.
I have my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't give up.
Did you steal it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father likes a fish like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan showed himself to be a champion of the white race.
I'll try to pull them off.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's better prepared than I am.
He's floating like a storm.
Tom didn't tell Mary he needed to buy.
She brought the metal.
"Tom, hurry up." "I'm going!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We've already faced this problem.
I'm trying to speak French.
I'm not like everything else.
I managed to get two tickets to the concert.
He likes to boast about his father's successful car business.
She's in sunscreen eyes.
Come on, Emily, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of the computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Negative by negative is plus.
In the basement.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
Tell me something.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the barn.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're classic.
I had a date with friends.
Jane's forgiveness really hurt us.
I'm trying not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look stunning.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't hold his smile.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "girl"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is the knowledge that you didn't even know you didn't.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should have thought well before you made her pregnant.
Tom says he's not getting married to Mary.
I got two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom fainted.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
Can I come too?
Is Tom working enough to live in the city?
Question over.
Please turn off the radio.
He said he wasn't sure about his answers.
I heard about Tom and Mary.
Take your jacket off if you're warm.
They're so many.
He couldn't act on the principles.
Mary says she's alone.
You're probably gonna leave at three o'clock.
That was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd come early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
It could be anyone.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom is given a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
Mainly, he's telling the truth.
I don't want Tom to sing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I had nothing wrong with it.
Tom maintains purity in his room.
These three books belong to Why.
He jumped from one theme to another.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's coming in.
It's not cold today.
I mistakenly put Tom's shirt on.
It seems that the bank's robbery was planned right up to the mall.
So he didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Hold on a second.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank is empty.
Why didn't you show her why?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I bathed in the river.
Tell them to take off the tube.
Can you tell us what it is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher, isn't he?
Don't make me kill you!
Which one do you like more?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't hurt us.
You may not answer.
Tom's got a lot of books.
Can you distinguish the alligator from the crocodile?
Wait, is that what?
My grandfather built this house.
You want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a child.
You really want me to say 'cause you killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
All the people were touched by his words.
You know how dangerous that is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
Yes, everyone, listen, please.
It's made of wood or metal?
Excuse me!
I think Tom is my friend.
In order to remain unconscious and free, the nation is counting on what has never been and will never be.
Tom's barely breathing.
Dogs don't change colors.
Tom poured water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are true animals.
The house of Tom was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
Two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna call you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be one than in a bad company.
That's the wrong data.
There is a difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom's lazy.
You have to tell 'cause he doesn't do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he looks.
Come closer.
We stopped at the Hilton Hotel.
That's why it's worth telling Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She kept complaining that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call that?
There's something you need to do.
She gave him a gift.
Mary's in her room.
Attention!
At the same time, I fell in love with this language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
Is that what you ordered this pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom's my close friend.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You didn't have to go into the woods alone.
No one sees my tears.
Tom fell asleep again.
She likes you very much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are multiple.
I've never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you're in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm so happy to meet you.
I haven't forgotten the meeting.
They had a wedding last summer.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everybody knows we didn't do that.
I thought Tom was never in Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five years old.
We appealed to the noise manager in the neighborhood.
I'm not gonna let you do this.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need it.
Honesty is one of the righteous.
As soon as you meet him in the new year, you'll have him.
There's no book in the library in French.
Any dangerous summary, especially one.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write this to a surgeon, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you the way I do.
Take your time, then.
Do you know how to jog?
Did you kill your wife?
We have exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they weren't coming.
I don't bear the kind of animal suffering.
I think Tatoeba's slowing down today.
Sally had her brother clean the toilet.
Mary's apartment has a complete mess.
The conference room is busy now.
Potato chips are harmful to your health.
Mine's not as good as yours.
I look forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He made a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
This is where it went.
Do you see the star?
Ask Tom.
Get the rope!
You've spoken so often yourself.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been.
Can't we fire her?
The artificial satellite was released into orbit.
I'm totally serious.
Are you sure you're sick?
It's too simple.
What happens to our children if the nuclear war starts?
I told them the bank wasn't working.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sorry about that.
Something to tell me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
Tom didn't tell us what he was so upset about.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know this better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like this.
You have something to hide, don't you?
You're lying to me.
Tom was very young.
The account shall be paid by the first number of the following month.
My French is terrible.
We need help.
You're scared of her.
For me, Boston is a cold city, not Chicago.
Tom was the victim of an extortion attempt.
I can't talk about a colleague.
Tom lives a long way from you?
Why didn't I die?
The spore's over with the dragon.
I didn't take it.
Tom came here yesterday.
I'd like to leave a message.
You chose not that man.
They risked a lot.
We have a white cat.
Maybe you'll never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home yesterday?
If anyone can do that, Tom.
The meeting was canceled because of the typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
On the way, she was riding a mule.
Tom speaks French to his grandparents and his parents in English.
I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom was hard to find.
Everybody dances!
I live with Tom.
That's where I met them.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is you don't have enough patience.
Several events marked the 20th century.
Stop doing this, Tom.
Tom said he wasn't planning on doing this.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told him to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said it couldn't be.
He got out of bed.
Trains are according to schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think that it is impossible not to be confused in languages.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Is the exam going to be today?
What's causing you?
He gave Lee his own computer.
Put your hands in the air.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom will agree to meet us?
They say that anyone in America can be president, but it probably isn't.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first one on the list is Tom.
What else have you missed?
Mary tried to calm down.
How long does the train arrive?
How long does this train go to Boston?
Didn't you see that?
I need you to call me.
Tom never suspected that Mary and John met each other.
When I get rich, I buy a farm.
I made him some coffee.
It's the neighboring country.
I invited my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Please translate it into French.
Take the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd rose rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me about what happened.
Cut the hair and kill.
I'll find her.
Did you think about what I said?
I'm very cold.
We're looking for you!
She loves everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom's.
In Tom's weak heart.
That's why she'll have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a karma knife?
Tom took off his billboard.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do it on your own.
No one's seen you take it.
I'll be half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to go back.
We've talked.
I can't believe I finally made it.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry!
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know what book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white guy's paper shirt.
It's a tower.
I'll have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Is anyone here with them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
That's what we can do.
He knows his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary wears a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There's a lot of perspectives in this town.
What are you wearing?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find the hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told him yet, have you?
She's got a double underpants.
We can't get people to do this.
Let me take her.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't bear this color.
They sleep together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
Our neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Him.
She's got flaws.
I wonder why it's necessary.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom's not the only one in Boston.
Will you support me?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
That's what you have to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Is it your friend or the enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter's about to end.
The titles and awards don't mean anything to me.
Where did you find him?
The meeting's over.
I'll find out.
Have you had a good weekend?
Tom's drinking beer.
You don't want to do it. Don't!
Tom had a good job.
Is it good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring him a drink.
What do you want to eat at these exits?
Get out of here!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we're going to go wrong.
I can't call him home.
You had to apologize to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy was running home.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom looks optimistic.
He's not buying a camera.
I've done everything I can to help you.
I'll join you with her.
It has received the highest scores.
Tom can blow up.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color is your childhood associated with?
I was leaving in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do that.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of a full-time homer.
I'd like to go.
Give me some notes or something.
I don't want to get out of the house.
He'll be here today.
Like he died.
Now only half the ninth?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me today.
Tom doesn't look very good.
She put herself on her hands to warm them up.
Tom said he was glad you were back.
My car's covered in blue shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Lori home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I'm not gonna make that mistake anymore.
I don't care whether we stay or not.
I made her marry him.
I've been waiting my whole life for that day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane went into the camp.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any friends in Indonesia?
You may need to help her.
Mary lost her consciousness.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where's your zone?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hello," said Tom.
Where are you?
I didn't die yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
You seem to be afraid of my dog.
In the attack!
Look at the price.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal is as a message in a bottle.
You can't find work here.
Can you hear me for a minute?
You loved everyone.
We're family souls with him.
I have your granddaughter.
I'm sorry I took your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you get to know him?
I never worked with her.
She began to work in her new office.
Let us take care of it.
I think you're sitting in my place.
I was planning on doing this yesterday.
It's been a while, isn't it?
My parents don't like my manner of dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit him hard.
Because I'm sorry?
It's priceless.
Can I take your hand?
He's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
That night wasn't lying.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about cellulite.
The show needs to start watching when all seasons are off!
Road accidents happen every day.
Where'd you guys go to get a lick?
Were you in the parrickmacher?
The perspective is striking.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me a scarf.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept in two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get out of here.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's take a picture together.
I failed my exam.
They all knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The footballer made a huge mistake.
They're coming, too?
She's asking like a baby.
Tom forgot to let go of the brake.
This song reminds me of one girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The explosion shook the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged.
It's my cat.
Do you have any kids?
Tom didn't want to have breakfast.
They like it.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a confident idiot.
It won't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I think you need help.
Don't look at me!
I drove to Boston last month.
Let go of the cat.
I know you're all rabbits.
Tom believes that deleting products is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place goes right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom's sweating whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's responding.
I'm glad I didn't meet him.
How much did he cost?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm the same as I used to be.
Do you know the boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do that.
A thief steals a cow and a cow.
Tom doesn't swim very well, does he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just the shadow of his former self.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to go to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Everything's going on.
What day is it today?
Let's give it another chance.
I just want you to take me the way I am.
I'm a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily in her mouth?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he'd come with us.
Tom died the day after.
Tom and I have to stick together.
I've only heard good about him.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
Don't compare yourself with us.
I saw the car exploded.
The window's here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw out my Plaster.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV show?
You want to go to the movie tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Chemodan Tom is empty.
Oh, my God, it's hot!
I'm afraid you'll lose.
I like to go to school.
I offered you some help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thanks to me for your son.
Her father seems to be a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything about it.
Tell 'cause I'm going home today.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer gave courage to his people.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm going to try things like that.
I don't understand much about hunting.
For the first time in my life, I'm cooking meat on my grill.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many Zones do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
It was already known.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's gonna pay.
Mom, look what I found.
It's interesting what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom must be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driving rights.
I cut myself every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an acid apple.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new directory.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Are you getting a job at home?
According to mythology, Prometheus captured the sacred fire of the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers were able to get out of the bus before it was burned.
I want to help you figure that out.
You speak French better than me.
There are many talented people in our town, but Tom doesn't belong to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars were dying in the night sky.
I doubt Tom will win.
“Oh, here you are so boring.” “My little boy, this world is looking for everything.” “Here I am! Your Majesty, Genon and his servants have captured the island of Corinth.”
Do you know who's playing this song?
Is your time right?
I'll see you tomorrow at 3:00.
I was at your wedding.
Tom can barely swim.
You're doing well.
I met her on the way home from school.
I didn't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the milk you used?
Tom wanted to learn to read.
I'm going home.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed the money.
Tom helped Mary put on her clothes.
A is a number consisting of elements (c), (b) and (a).
I'll be back at nine.
He has diabetes.
We can deal with them.
I just wondered if you had any experience you'd like to share with us.
Tom slept without his clothes.
Pray for us.
What kind of music are you listening to in the car?
That's what I was told three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French Revolution began during the reign of Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to swim in the sea.
It'll be entirely up to him.
I met a classmate.
He's grown up enough to travel with one another.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our city was haunted by power.
No one saw them leave the room.
Two big coffees, please.
We talked about you.
What kind of music do you normally listen to?
Without bread, I don't eat.
Tomorrow will be snow.

Soon we'll be able to put you in jail.
I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sure Tom would like to help.
It's Joanna.
I made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
That's why I'm really sorry.
I like your eyes.
The rainwater flows through this tube.
I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm one of the girls who hang out with guys.
Don't worry, I have insurance.
Tom will be here with me.
It's hard for my father to quit drinking.
No one's suggesting that you do this.
He works in this company from Monday to Sunday.
Mary forgot to shut the car down.
I'm old.
Tom left Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic capabilities.
Who is he of nationality?
Tom was sitting in one of the cameras with John.
I didn't want to swim.
He drank beer.
In our time, it's harder for a man to be... alone.
I'll never talk to him again.
Sh-sh, Tom, wake up!
I smell my nose plates.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all children.
She left and yelled at me.
Did you take your medicine?
The rabbits are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
You wanted to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still mad.
You'll be better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you feel the smell of burnt resin?
It didn't happen here.
When will your father come home?
I understand.
Tom gave Mary the book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my soul.
Tom patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom's trying to escape.
You must be tired.
We're champions.
Tom's deaf.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair's wet from the ground.
I'm just buying a soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat in the middle between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it takes?
The guide is a complimentary master.
Tom's getting married to Mary, right?
All the rocks in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
I've got it all working.
Vermont is located on the border with Canada.
He had to live in one room with his brother.
I didn't imbecile.
You're gonna do it, aren't you?
I can't hunt.
He has a brother in Tokyo.
Dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We need to get involved.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can come down if you want.
I know you don't have to do this.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my eyes.
I've already talked to this student.
What is the chemical sign of bromohydric acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
That's why we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you need to do this.
The key!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a yard.
I respect his views, although I do not agree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him a sweater.
I don't think Tom will want to go with you to Boston.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine call cheap?
You don't have to go.
Put it in the middle.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her not to.
He didn't say anything.
They don't use you, do they?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
You've been planning on staying for a long time?
We had an emergency and left right now.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're straight.
Careful, don't piss yourself off.
Make every meal out of soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He's sitting right across from me.
The boiler was open.
I brought the wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to see you before I die.
She's beautiful too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?
They're dead.
Big apples.
You didn't know Tom was living in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
She's a poet?
I need to get into the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's get to the car.
You're bothering me.
She wondered how his lips would taste.
A good coach is training this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was stopped because of heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What did you take from me that I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him you were wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It must have been you.
Mary left me in my locker room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you have eaten?
You don't know her?
I didn't ask Tom whether he was planning on doing it or not.
I'm falling.
I was unable to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing a new shoe.
Last year she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
I don't have to thank you.
Since it was winter, he didn't go out on the street.
I'm going down the street. I saw my friend.
How many houses on your street?
The elephants are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"What's life, Mike?" "My name's Tom."
Her native French.
It's a dark suit.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naïveness is its only positive quality.
My hobby is collecting insects.
Tom's baby lived in Boston.
I haven't eaten for six days.
Can I tell them about this?
She's been quiet all day.
It doesn't matter what he can say, don't believe him.
I've moved on.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary is always very kind, and she has a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, young people fall asleep under a blanket.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could know a lot of them if you only listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry to bother you.
He who has never left his country is a slave to prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you were coming back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I've got an idea.
I thought we could do that.
My mom was against me driving alone.
I'm sorry, I don't get it.
You know what you're doing, don't you?
You can't trust the machine.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There are fish in this river.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
We're partners with her.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms?
The prisoner is released.
What did they say happened?
Couldn't you leave the door open?
That's what we'll have to wait for.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows what they made was a mistake.
In Japan, the climate is mild.
Check again.
Don't condemn Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let him do what he wanted.
He replaced the traumatized game.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip was very smooth.
It's inevitable that I'm going to France once, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
He's only getting sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain stopped, maybe open the window again.
I've never been that way before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was gonna go out when I called.
I don't have to endure this.
Always step down the road to the right.
They're asking us to introduce themselves.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
Maybe she's nice, but I don't like her.
I can drop you off if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot tub.
I really don't have that much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about that.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
She's my lover!
The sound of your voice as a melodic song is siren to me.
How can you be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers left on a glass of prints.
Chemistry is a remarkable science.
I have such a feeling that my Frenchman doesn't get much better.
How can I best get a passport?
Maybe you can help him.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom hasn't been paying attention to Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell a house, but he doesn't have a choice.
Find some more light.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my father's car, but it'll be mine soon.
Did you forget what his name was?
If I had time to do this, I would.
Do you see the boat, Tom?
A big smoke?
This medicine will help you.
Stop the noise.
I'm in pain.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom pretends to be busy.
I'll trust someone.
She's a fan of "Sex in a Big City".
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Talk to him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
Christ works, stop it!
Nothing compares to a bottle of beer after a long working day.
What's wrong?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How much time do you need?
Let's get over here.
Are you in new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom used to say.
She speeded up the giraffe when she saw the dog.
He's not more than me.
Smoking is strictly forbidden.
This peache is beautiful.
You see?
Tom's not in shock.
You didn't have to go to such a dangerous place.
Good job!
You used to say that all the time.
Here's a few letters for you.
It is practically unthinkable that such a scientific level would have made such an elemental error.
He has no evidence.
You look bad.
He was a very good swimmer when he was young.
I'm writing to a friend.
He's very good at playing tennis.
She misled the students.
She said she was Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you gonna tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled the kitchen upstairs.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it right now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it's not nice.
What are we living for?
Will it rain today?
We know about her.
You could help us.
I drive a car a lot.
That's why I don't like the movie.
Just get in there.
Just ask him for forgiveness.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I've had two of you.
I didn't know it was legal.
I like adventures.
Tom's in the library.
You were in school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you good enough?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be a big snowfall.
We decided to move the meeting to the next Sunday.
She thinks she can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know the name Tom.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like carnival.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
To whom did Tom sell his car?
Tom's moaning.
I have to make money to buy a computer.
Don't laugh at strangers.
I don't know them.
If you could choose genes for your children, would you?
That's why Mary and I need to get some rest.
It was easy to sleep.
It could have been worse.
Tom did his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys are.
What book are you looking for?
I'm sleeping a little.
Someday you'll be there.
Tom's having a good time with Mary.
"You owe me money." "No, you don't."
He's on his knees.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did this for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom earns three times more than Mary.
I drank milk.
Tomorrow will be snow.
Isn't life remarkable?
When it comes to getting ready, no one's gonna compare with Mary.
You're not yourself lately.
Tom lost his leg when he attacked the shark.
I blew it for you.
We'll do it as soon as we can.
Next year, I'll be three times your senior.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your brand collection.
It'll take forever.
That's a little bit higher than Mary.
He seems like no one knows.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This tissue fits into your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's almost winter.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up his professional guitar game.
I'm married now.
It was just a couple of times.
This time you've gone too far.
It's working.
Are you going to see Tom before you leave?
No wonder, he answered Tom.
We want to take off the apartment in the city.
They spoke more French.
It's extremely expensive.
He doesn't drink anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They haven't woken up yet.
Tom for a couple of inches above Mary.
I'm glad you offered that.
It's hard to answer your question.
You don't believe her?
English is a worldwide language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told him to leave Mary alone.
You didn't know Tom was living in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why do you need milk?
Stay with me, Dad!
The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a car held instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She's breaking up.
I won't let you take my kids.
Don't give it to him.
You're under arrest.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom used to meditate every morning.
Have you checked your bills?
He tried to make a short story.
Room without books, like a body without souls.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What's your brother doing?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in hundreds of years.
I called Tony yesterday.
It's easy to impress.
You're old enough to do this on your own.
Aristotle believed that the earth was the center of the universe.
It's interesting that Tom actually meant it.
No one understands me.
There's so many stars in the sky, I can't re-read them.
Everyone came back and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in the Arctic.
I told you I was the best of all.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask me to do something a few times.
Let's wash the dishes today.
What a failure!
I'd never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He ran into the Russian language — at least, he told me.
Tom's a third.
Will you stay long?
I'm not a woman.
She's got a tall father.
The train was overloaded.
The house is red.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
You don't know Boston well, do you?
The orchestra started playing.
Mary was wearing a pirate suit.
It's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it earlier?
Tom didn't want to be a hit man.
He was born at seven o'clock tomorrow, 5 June 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.
Tom is just white meat.
Thank you for helping.
All three of us have rules.
She bought one of herself.
Security didn't see Tom.
In recent years, Tom has noted this.
I helped carry those bags.
They have plenty of time.
Fifteen to five is seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anything anymore.
You don't know what he's gonna say yet.
My hands are up.
I always took my wife.
Finally, she did it.
It's a great shame they weren't insured from the fire.
We've got a bunch of money.
The exam was split into two parts.
When are you gonna tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Hey, you're so bored here!
Let's compare the book reading with the journey.
Tom saw Mary go into the store.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary would probably win.
The Japanese would never do that.
I don't have enough of Boston.
She's always writing letters.
I don't know who to consult with.
Turn left at the corner.
Tom taught me to do this.
You can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I'm not bringing up disobedient children.
Tom bought it for me.
What you said upset everyone.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for 30 years.
She demonstrated her talents.
I'd like that to be possible.
I guess you can't do this.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
Bob's next school festival will play a leading role for the first time.
You must stay in shape.
I've been sucking seeds all day.
I realized he's an American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Be kind to me!
Tom has surrendered.
All the people of my generation think about it the same way.
I live for that.
Do you know how to climb a ladder?
Duke reigns in many lands.
At least they're having fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's getting better.
You'll feel at home.
It's not going to end well!
He looked like he didn't eat a few days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American politician."
Get out of here!
If it's not selling goods at home, then maybe it's a new way to get to know girls?
Tom improved the coin.
Why didn't you get out of your room?
If there's no God, it's all allowed.
Both of us are called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything as an honor.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please pull the straps during the flight and landing.
It was So and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've been waiting a long time.
I rejected the offer.
You want to come with us?
Tom, not El.
I'll have too much time to explain why it doesn't work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all of this yourself?
I'm looking forward to summer vacation.
Can we put that in another one?
From here he looks great.
Wooden houses are easily burned.
So let's have a party.
The dog is still alive.
I'm going to college.
I know you lied.
It's very comfortable.
I'll report this tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's out of her mind.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for his arrival.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoe.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled on Tuesday.
My name is Jose.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do this without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged a meeting?
I'm such a naughty guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have any fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in the room.
What kind of bird can't fly?
That's what we need to put an end to.
Tom didn't respond right away.
Tom died at the age of seventy.
Life is a gift.
Tom speaks more French.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexei?
You look like a girl.
Here's a few photos.
What's going on on the 10th channel?
I hate spinach.
Mother's cooking lunch.
Tom's a pancake.
What can I do?
Her son is a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's willing to give up his emotions.
We were shocked by the news of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I didn't see you.
You're just making it clear.
He had cancer.
You're responsible for what happened.
It's just like hours.
I know where you're going.
You get it on the flight.
Let's blow him up.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaning woman interrupted the conversation.
On the writing table, the cat.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not getting any more sleep.
Tom was a busy smoker.
Tom put on his gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to the weather.
I wonder who's gonna help him decorate the snowman?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in family souls?
What's that noise?
My son has inherited a disease.
That's disgusting.
Is it snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a country where you can marry your dog.
Better protection is an attack.
She's getting married this autumn.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it'd be easier.
Is there anything we can do to help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
Investigations began last year since the confiscation of computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's life?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What did you decide you couldn't?
We went back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe that?
Thank you for your correction.
She's with her mind?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get this scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom is running his gang.
Tom can't ride a bike.
I'm not talking to the body.
What did Tom leave for?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed at tears.
I spent $500 a day.
Tell them to go home.
Yeah, wherever it puts it.
They didn't make it in time.
Now seven thirty.
I see you've woken up.
I want to know who said that because.
Tom got up early to see the light.
The dinosaurs died a long time ago.
I usually get up one by one.
Tom's been out for another year.
I'm around the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
You're from Boston, aren't you?
Put it on my desk.
Tom, get out of the water.
I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
Do you know Brother Tom?
All blades can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I've got it all out of my hands today.
I asked them to stay away from this.
I've only learned to drive in thirty.
I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed in a long time.
The kitchen knife was hard enough to cut the meat, so I took advantage of my wig knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You'll be able to adapt to village life soon.
Keep close to the water.
You're no longer a child.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We're all set.
This is the river's deepest.
Thank you very much.
I told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
I guess you should tell him.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Writing words separately when they are to be written is a major problem in Norwegian.
What are you doing with the leftovers?
It's been ten years since her death.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Do you need anything else?
We left soon after that.
This book should be read.
Tom and Mary did lessons for dinner.
I don't want your tea.
You're always so romantic.
The woman is not a frog. You're not taking off your legs.
I'll follow you at 6:00.
So I teach French.
I like to learn other languages.
Mary's eyes.
I would like to know how long Tom is planning to live in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give it a chance.
I like fruits.
Tom had a secret.
He's trading cars.
You still have a relationship with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope he won't."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate a game.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check.
Tom gave Mary the rose.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They were first taken on a bus.
Let's wait till Monday.
Does anyone know them here?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take leave.
I'm used to smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was the day?
It's your fault.
I told you when I was coming.
Of course, I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to the case.
Tom was sitting on his feet.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes the mole beats twice in one place.
I don't boast.
Leave it behind.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door open.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
Make up your mind.
Were you surprised?
We counted the annual rings on the tree that we broke and determined that he was thirty years old.
I think I know you all my life.
I want Tom never to write my daughter again.
The rabbits are multiplying rapidly.
I don't want to discuss this right now.
How much will the clean coat go for?
We'll decorate it.
Open the door tight.
I'm not afraid to go to the cave.
When happiness ends in your door.
You need to listen to her.
I'd like you to know how much you mean to me.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tell me frankly.
I'll come to whatever happens.
You don't mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I don't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom's gone last.

Now I understand.
Give me some time.
Do you want them to help?

I'll give you a bike on your birthday.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.

I'd like you to talk to him.
You kind of said she was yours.

Now tell me something about you.
Tom was the only one in the pool.
I'm studying French on my own.
Tom couldn't answer all Mary's questions.
Tom teaches my children French.
Tom says he didn't eat for three days.
It doesn't seem like Tom's having fun.
There's some non-sticks here.
I had to tell him to go there.
We're done.
I know you're in love with Tom.
Dick gave me the photo.
You said you'd help her.
Did you really expect Tom to tell you the truth?
I couldn't look at her face.
That could be the end of it.
Someone sent us a present.
Tom and I have been married for three years.
It's hard to live with Tom, isn't it?
Have you ever seen Tom dance?
Tom asked me for advice.
Tom started crying.
She's wearing a sailor.
He'd never tell me.
She wasn't sick.

Are you playing guitar?
We hope we don't have to do this.
We have a situation under control.
Who's there?
Today's payday?
It's obviously inevitable.
