Wise Members are worried that they will be misled by the "papers"
Some Members expressed concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This concern arose in relation to the plans to change the name of the assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
Members throughout the political spectrum are concerned that such a thing will sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party said his resignation was concerned that "it would make a difference with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers out of the Way: In the Way, the word "twp" means "hate" and the word "pwp" means "delicate".
A Plaint MP said that the overall extension was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
One Veal conservative stated that his extension was "open mouth" about the change of name, but noted that the word MWP does not leave much of the word "map".
In this context, the Waalic letter w is similar to the English word for Yorksair in the letter u.
The parliamentary committee, which is currently drawing up the bill for the change of name, said: "The final decision on any name by which Members will be called will naturally be the case of the Members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales 2017 gave Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the name of the Parliament as the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of the Members, the Commission voted in favour of the term "Member of the Parliament of the Council" or WMP, but the choice of MWP is the one that has been more supported in the public consultation.
Members are obviously proposing alternative options, but the attempt to reach consensus may be a difficult case for Parliament's President, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill for change of name within the next few weeks.
The Law on Reforms will also include other changes in the way in which Parliament operates, inter alia, falling from the office of the Member and the design of the committee system.
Members will decide in the final vote on the question of their name during the legislative debate.
In the pictures, citizens of Macedonia come to the resolution on the change of the country's name
Voters will vote Sunday on the change of the country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The people's vote was requested in an effort to resolve a decade-long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that its northern neighbour's name conceals territorial sights and has repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Mr Giorge Ivanoff, President of Macedonia, the war of the referendum on the change of name, said that he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaf, claim that the change is just the price they have to pay for their EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's campaigns are silent as the churches in Harlem disappear.
"The older people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, there's none of the two."
He said he understood the reason the bars disappeared.
"The world is socialized in a different way today," he said.
"The bar is no longer the neighborhood salon where the world regularly frequents."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the assets will not hold as long as the competent authorities hope that they "will return to the point from where they started".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by multi housed people who will not be willing to help the places of worship that have remained in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus will hasten the day when all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all these people who will move to these apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The early Methodist Church left in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation that was close to home took over the building.
The possession of St. Martin’s building took over a black church under the famous John Howard Johnson, who went on a boycott of the 125th Street stores, a major trading road in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson’s enormities took over the reconstruction and ordered the carione.
The famous David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin's church, proudly called the carriage "the campaigns of the poor."
The specialist who played the chariot in July described it somewhat differently: "political treasure" and "replaced historically important organ".
Specialist Tiffany Inn from Michigan University also noted that it was the first carione in the world played by black music, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a larger carione in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meigueder said St. Martin's church didn't replace him.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin is a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom were taken from the church’s folk leaders, and others from the church.
The panellists - the governing body of the union, which is made up of the people's leaders - sent a letter to the Council in July about their concerns that the panel "would try to transfer the cost" to the body of the permits, despite the fact that this did not interfere with the recruitment of the architects and the workers sent by the church.
Some enorites have voiced complaints about lack of transparency on the part of the audience.
Ship landing at 13 years of age for birds in California
Cancer attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during the landings for fish in California, the first day of the time of the camp, according to the principles.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. on the Bicon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been down with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of the child who was crying for help and approached with a team to take him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just a scream of excitement because he got caught up, but then he realized he was calling out, "Something touched me!
Something touched me!"
His whole key had been opened," Hamel remarked when he got to the place where the boy was.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the sea!' said Hamel.
The boy was moved by air to Randy's Children's Hospital in San Diego and his situation is critical.
The type of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Mariner Larry Giles said in the type paper that the shark had been detected in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim brings serious injuries to the upper part of the body.
The authorities banned access to the beach from Poto Bis in Casablanca to Swamis in Ensinita for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Jill noted that there are more than 135 species of cancer in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans exert pressure on the US market for cosmetic products
The Sainsbury's is measured by Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams by placing strips of cosmetics corresponding to those of the multi-storey, dedicated to special servants.
In the context of the significant decrease in the US cosmetic market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while sales of clothing and household items show a fall, the largest cosmetics strips will be tested at 11 stores throughout the country and will spread to more stores if the operation succeeds.
The investment in the cosmetics sector comes as supermarkets are looking for a way to refill space in the reefs that once took on televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
The Sainsbury's said they would double the size of their cosmetic offer to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In the existing series of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees there will also be more room with reefs with company logo, like those stores like Boots.
The supermarket once again launches its own series of boutique makeup so that most products are vegan - something that increasingly demand the younger consumers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will try to dispose of its products in two Sainsbury's shops, one that opened in Krointon, South London, last week and the other in Shellie Oak, Bermiham, later this year.
The electronic markets and the market trend of small quantities of food per day in local mini markets mean that supermarkets should make greater efforts to make the world visit them.
Mike Kupp, Senior Counsellor of Sainsbury's, said that outlet stores will be more and more like retail stores, as supermarket chains are trying to compete for Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more non-food services.
The Sainsbury's placed outlet Argos stores in hundreds of stores, while also imported certain Habitats as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported the sales of pantyhose and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renew the parts of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals has failed.
The Sainsbury's tried a partnership with the Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a dispute about how to distribute the profits from pharmaceutical stores to the supermarkets of the chain.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold the pharmaceutical company that was placed with 281 shops in Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, compared to £ 125 million three years ago.
Lloyds said he would play his role in the project, adding an expanded range of luxury companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our reefs in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained personnel who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our companies has been designed to cover every need, while the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a possible destination for the cosmetics that doubt the traditional way of markets."
Peter Jones: crazy after Holly Willoby's departure from the 11 million-dollar agreement
The first winner of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is crazy after the departure of the Hollywood TV station from the £11 million agreement with the lifestyle company he has to dedicate to his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Wilombi doesn't have time for the clothing company and accessories True.
Their company was compared to the Goop company in Guineth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old exhibition "This Morning" announced her decision to leave in Instagram.
Holly Willoby made the first player in the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, exaggerating from their winning lifestyle business at the last moment, in order to dedicate himself to her new huge concerts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became crazy when the golden girl of the television was admitted during a conference full of tensions on Tuesday at the central offices of his empire in Marlowa, in Buckighamshair, that due to the new symbols - £1.5 million - he would no longer have had enough time to have in the company clothes and accessories True.
The company was compared to the Goop company in Guinette Paltroou and appears to double the property of Willoby, which is estimated to amount to £11 million.
After the 37-year-old Wilombi in Instagram announced that he was going to leave Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to some of his territorial residences.
According to some source: "Truly was far from Holly Willoby's top priorities.
It was her long-term future, her source of income for the next decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a warehouse full of products in the central offices in Marlowe ready to be made available for sale."
The experts estimate that the departure of this morning's exhibition, which is one of Britain's most commercial brands, could cost millions to the company due to the huge investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing, as well as further delay in its presentation.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin's wife have been in close friendship with Jones and Tara Cap's wife for ten years.
Willoby founded Truly with Cap in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined March as president.
Couples spend their holidays and Jones maintains a 40 percent share in Baldwin's television company.
Willoby is going to become the central person in M&S campaigns and replace And McPartlin at the I'm A Celebrity show on ITV.
A source from Jones' close environment said last night, "We wouldn't want to comment on his professional affairs."
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He was ridiculed for the criticism he received from the media about a school that some would consider to be inappropriate for a president, as well as for his positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trab make so many concessions?
Trab said it was a small-scale TV player.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by the Trab as a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean senior diplomat Ray Young-Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see any "opposite response" from the US after the early disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he pointed out, the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trab kept a much more optimistic attitude in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We're about to make a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
We have now built this excellent relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim gave positive results - ending the gun tests, releasing the hostages and returning the other American soldiers to their homes.
While supporting his unusual attitude in his statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a 'presidency' style, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in there, we'd only have 200 people here," said Trab, showing the crowd in front of him.
tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia hit an entire island, leaving thousands of dead in their passage
In the wake of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was announced that no assistance from foreign non-governmental organisations would be needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population was exposed, there was no national disaster, a necessary condition for the use of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has become clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is quite difficult," Mrs Sombung said.
While the Save the Children organisation is preparing a team to travel to Palos, it is not yet certain whether the foreign staff can work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, representative of the National Natural Disaster Service, said that the Indonesian authorities assessed the situation in Palos to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute aid.
Given the seismic thunderstorms that often affect Indonesia, the country remains fiercely unprepared against nature’s anger.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Atse, the same does not happen on other highways.
The apparent lack of an alarm series for tsunamis in Palau, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
In the best case, it is difficult to move between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters complicate even more administrative care.
A floating hospital that had been stationed in Lopok to care for the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palus, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of the new disaster.
President Joco Weidondo had at the centre of the campaign's election the improvement of Indonesia's unorganised infrastructure and spent a lot of money on building roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding is exacerbating Mr Joko's administration before re-election next year.
Mr Joco also accepts pressure from the persistent fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where the members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been shot as groups of Christians and Muslims are fighting in the streets, using swords, toxins and arrows, as well as other self - designed weapons.
Follow: Daniel Sterridge of Liverpool is against Chelsea
Daniel Sterice saved Liverpool from a raid at the Premier League against Chelsea with a bullet in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sterige accepted everything from Serdan Sakiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's end with his team losing 1-0.
Hit the ball on his left and shoot at the back of the dock.
His effort was very high from the big area and ended up on the right on the networks.
The ball finally fell over Capa Arizapalaga, which jumped to blow it off and got into the nets.
"I was trying to get this position, get to the ball and players like Sakiri always play as much forward as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," said Sterize at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I made a direct change, I didn't think too much of it, and I did the juice."
Chelsea had a 1-0 run in the mid-term after the golf course in the 25th minute by Belgian star Anden Azar.
The blue attacker gave all the tacony to Mateo Kovacics in this game before giving a shot with a face close to the center of the field and running on the side of Liverpool.
Kovacis did the two in the middle of the field.
Then he gave a deep bag, driving Azar to the big area.
Azar ran in front of the defensive and completed by sending the ball to the rear docks with a left-hand socket in front of Alison Baker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Naples at the Champions League rounds on Wednesday, 3pm, in Sandio San Paulo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The tragic calculation of the deaths from tsunami in Indonesia is 832
The calculation of deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is 832, according to the country's disaster service statements, early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of the buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 degree earthquake that struck the area on Friday and created waves 6 meters high, said service representative Sutopo Puruo Nugrohos in a type interview.
The city of Palau, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of the ruined buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old suspect after the murder of a woman with a knife
A murder investigation began after the discovery of a woman's body in Birkenheid, Merseyde this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 B.C.E. with knife wounds at Grayson Mouse in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in murder.
The police asked the residents who saw or heard something to deposit it to the police.
Officer Brian Haegan said, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to address a call to anyone in the neighborhood around John Street and saw or heard something suspected of communicating with us.
I would also like to call on anyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the cameras from the Dashcam cameras to contact us as they may have information that is vital to our research."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenheid and was found inside a building.
This afternoon friends who think they can meet the woman came to the crime scene to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
The investigations are under way as the police said they were in the process of informing the nearest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mouse, in his attempt to return to his apartment, was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was silent when he found out what happened.
The tenants were informed that it may take hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer is acting to tell a man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up with tears in the scene.
They kept saying, "It's scary."
At 2 a.m., two police vans were located through the police cortex and one outside.
Policemen were standing outside the corridor watching the polygamy.
Anyone who has any information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers line in 0800 555 111 for the 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's report in Parliament becomes the last memory affected by the philosophy of "recording history"
His exorcism would be a poetic justice for the Talibanist destruction of England's numerous cultural and religious works by his fanatic Puritan supporters.
However, Mr Cromwell has described Mr Creek's proposal as "anonymity" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Collogo, said: "In this debate on the removal of the locusts, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's shape outside the Westminster Enactors would not be targeted.
The iconoclasty of England’s civil wars was not banned or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas' ancestors in the last century.
The excellent reproduction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornikrofft is characteristic of his painting in the 19th century and part of the history of a personality that many believe is worth taxing.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century in relation to today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course the monarchy.
The fact that this is a very precise case is the subject of an open historical debate.
The only thing that is certain is that the conflicts in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized personality that represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord's Protector are also worthy and worthy."
Dog-killer injured dead Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in Southeast China, according to local news reports.
The man, known only as "Wyan", was found with a cut blood artery inside a lake near a pighouse on the market in Ljupansui in the province of Guicsou, in South China, Morning Post announced Sunday.
A pig hospital official is preparing to make pigs vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Jining in the province of Kinhai, China.
He must have traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and opened the door of a neighbouring pighouse.
He said there was a large male pig in the pighouse with blood in his mouth.
The doctor's examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kg had injured the farmer fatally, according to his report.
"My cousin's feet were dead and broken," said the cousin, known as "Go", according to the Guyang's evening news bulletin.
The security cameras show Wayne to enter the market on Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Owen or his cousin.
One market manager said in the evening news sheet that the pig has been placed in a cage so as not to attack anyone else, while the police collected the evidence at the scene of the attack.
The Wean family and the market authorities are going to negotiate some compensation for his death.
Although Spanish, cases of swine attacks on humans have also been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their village in Massachusetts, seriously hurting the man.
Ten years ago, a 295 - mile - long [295 km] pig threw a farmer in the Wayalia on the tractor until the farmer's wife scared the animal to get away.
After the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was destroyed by the pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as "inflammation".
"They just have a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to do any harm.
We just have to show them proper respect," he said.
The remains of the Rosa storm are going to bring extensive rainfalls to the South-West USA
According to the predictions, the Typhoon Rosa suffers as it moves above the coldest water masses on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa storm will bring devastating rainfalls to North Mexico and the South-West USA in the coming days.
The wind power of the Rosa storm reached 85 mph, being Category 1, at 5 pm east time, on Sunday and was detected 385 miles south-west of Puta Eugenia in Mexico.
The Rosa typhoon is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a region of low air pressure has begun to form above the Pacific Ocean and to move east to the Western Pacific. As the Twentieth Rosa nears the peninsula of Lower California on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical moisture to the north in the South-West USA.
The Rosa typhoon will bring rainfalls of 25 million in areas of Mexico on Monday.
Afterwards, the tropical humidity combined with the area of low air pressure approaching will create extensive heavy rainfalls in the southwest in the coming days.
Local rains of 2.5 to 10 million will cause dangerous floods, floods and possible flooding in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates that range from 5 to 7.5 million per hour per day, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Brochures of between 5 and 10 percent are expected to be located in the southwest, especially in much of the Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of phenomena due to the spread of tropical rainfalls.
It is recommended that you avoid any movement with your feet into the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Strong rainfalls can turn frogs into vertical rivers and storms will cause local winds and sandfalls.
The area of low air pressure will create some local strong rainfall on the southern California coast.
Total rainfall of more than 1 million is likely, which may cause small flooding and road lysity.
This will be the first rainfall of the liquid period in the area.
Some divided tropical boars will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early mornings on Monday, before the phenomena are extended late Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rainfalls will spread to the For Corners area on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes will be observed throughout the United States as temperatures fall in the Arctic, but in tropical zones they remain quite high.
Sometimes this leads to very intense temperature changes at close distances.
A typical example of the intense differences in temperature between the Central USA was observed on Sunday.
There was a difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Mizouri and the Group, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moine in Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent high heat temperatures will be observed and will spread again.
In much of the Central and Eastern USA, October is expected to start at high temperatures at 27 °C from the Eastern plains to parts in the South-East.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast for the time, there are several possibilities for temperatures above the average in the Eastern US until the first half of October.
More than 20 million TV viewers watched Brett Kavano's hearing
More than 20 million TV viewers have been monitoring the filing of the candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court of Brett Kavanos, Thursday and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which is due to happen in the 1980s, Christine Blaise Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political unrest continued, with television networks, to interrupt the normal flow of the program for the last time of Friday: the agreement by Arizona Mayor Jeff Flake for a week's investigation by the FBI in relation to the categories.
Ford told the Justice Committee of the Authority that he was 100 percent sure about how he was at a party while she was a high school student, Kavano attacked while he was drunk and tried to get her clothes off.
Kavano, in a loaded deposit, said it's 100 percent certain that something like that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's measurements, it is likely that more than 20.4 million TVs have been heard on Friday.
The company has recorded the average TV on the networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While also, Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate the number of televisions that monitor a broadcast from office space.
To see this television in its right range, it is a common size with what is being observed in a football match of the win-offs or the Oscar award ceremony.
The Fox News channel, whose journalists strongly supported the appointment of Kavanos, was promoted by an average of 5.69 million televisions during the entire day hearing, according to Nielsen.
In the second place, the ABC is located with 3.26 million televisions.
They followed CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high and after the hearing.
Fleke was a leading player in the drama of Friday.
Following the Republican mid-term statement that he would vote in favour of Kavano, CNN and CBS cameras signed Friday morning protestors to recognise him as he was trying to get into the elevator for hearing from the Justice Committee of the House.
He stood up with the view low for a few minutes as he was recognized, alive on TV at CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Fleic said his office had made statements and, before his elevator doors were closed, he would have said more in the Commission hearing.
All cable television and transmission networks were alive a few hours later, the vote by the Committee on Justice of the House on promoting Kavano's candidacy in the House to vote.
However, Fleik said he would only do so if the FBI was investigating the allegations against the candidate next week, something requested by the minority of the Republicans.
Felix was partly convinced after discussions with his friend, the CEO of the Democratic Party, Chris Cuns.
After discussions with Kuns and some other mayors, Fleic decided.
Fleic's choice was valid because it was clear that the Republicans would not concentrate their votes on the approval of Kavanos without conducting an investigation.
President Trab asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavano.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of leaving plans from the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the Constituent Party Conference in Burma, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her at the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has been very critical of the Chekers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal to obtain tariffs between Britain and the EU was "incredibly unreasonable".
Weid Sims Shooting: Police arrested suspect Dayon Simson for murdering the player in LSU
The police arrested a suspect for the deadly shooting of Weid Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dayon Simson, 20 years old, was arrested and detained in a second-degree murder prison, according to Baton Rose's police department.
The authorities have in their hands a video from the Sims complex with Simson and, according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Policemen located the glasses in the crime scene and said they found traces of Simson's DNA, according to the WAFB who cooperates with CBS.
After Simson's interrogation, the police said he admitted to having injured Wade mortally.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report by East Baton Rose, who released Friday, the cause of death is bullet injury to the head and neck.
The Ministry made available to the Louisiana Police a special working group, the police crime lab, the police forces of the South University and the citizens of the region to assist in the arrest investigation.
LSU sports director Joey Alèva welcomed the local law enforcement authorities for "research and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre furrowed raised Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 Ribauds per match last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Weil Weide basketball team said the team was "concentrated" and "in shock" since Weide's death.
"We're always worried about events like this," Wade said.
Heat emissions in Mexico City
The emissions of volcanic ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighbours of the capital of Mexico.
The National Catastrophe Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the ceiling, after the activity in the container reached its peak, with 183 gas and sulphur emissions recorded for 24 hours.
The Centre was monitoring various indications and small seismic thunderstorms.
Images in the social media show a car parade covered with fine layers of ash in neighboring Mexico City like Sochimilco.
The geophysicals have observed an increase in the activity of the ceiling located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 right in central Mexico in September 2017.
The ceiling, known as Don Gogio, has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan self-defencers in view of the vote on independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a protest in favour of independence with the recovery units, as thousands took part in the demonstrations for the first year of the vote on the rejection of Catalonia that caused pollution.
A group of masked demonstrators for independence, held by the recovery units of the class, threw eggs and dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually closed by tourists.
Constabularies were also noted later during the day with policemen to use their club to destroy the complexes.
At times, groups of supporters of Catalonia's independence called the symptom "Don't Forgive, We Don't Forget" against groups of protesters for the unity of the country called "Live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated with micro-injury during the demonstrations, according to the local type.
The tensions remain high in the area that supports independence one year after the declaration of the 1 October referendum as illegal by Madrid, however celebrated by the Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, although the approach was low with those who opposed independence to boycott the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police authorities tried to stop the vote at the polling stations in the area where violent complications were detected.
Independence groups have spent an early Friday to prevent a demonstration of national police support.
The demonstration was carried out and another change was required.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the protests for independence with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's prospects of gaining independence.
"Last night we lived one of our brightest moments.
I saw my parents with tears of joy who were able to vote, but now the situation is stable," he said.
Despite the fact that they won a victory of vital importance, although limited in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties fought for independence to maintain their strength this year, with many of their most known leaders being themselves exonerated or in detention pending their trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Poutch, a 42-year-old engineer, who recorded his protests with his cell phone for the police, said the conflicts were fueled by both politicians.
"The tension is escalating more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Zwunker, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were detained last year, announced his candidacy in the European elections for the following year.
"My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to complain about the suppression of democratic values and the oppression we have received from the Spanish Government," he said.
London: Man's arrest after a car crash in a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a repeated car crash in London.
The incident was developed at Bolinagcard Christmas on Friday at around 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemings said damage was caused to the gates and to the building itself.
There may have been a shooting in the car at some point.
Menga's hit won the Livingstone 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's First Ball for Livingston Guaranteed Victory
Providing Livingston surprised the Rangers by enjoying Steven Gerard just his second match in 18 games as a manager of the Ibrox group.
The Dolly Menga hit made the difference as Gary Holt's side changed the level with the Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team is out of the field in the championship this season and is facing the Carders, who have the eight-degree race, next Sunday.
Before this game, the Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna in Europe's League on Thursday.
Livingston in the middle continues her run in six games in her class, with the main coach Holt not yet tasted any dirt since she replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before he scored, with its inability to bring the Rangers into a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took the lead and was about to finish, but Alan Lithkow stepped out of his attempt by shaking Craig Halket's head away from the finish.
The peasants were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could limit visitors to free beatings and horns.
And that's how the important golf came.
The Rangers couldn't prevent a free hit, and Livingston opened the opening, Deklan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to send the ball to Menga, who took it all and scored from the center of the area.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball holding, but they found the defense of the fieldmen to be inexhaustible and the security guard Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morellos pulled the ball off Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was blown off by Rangers' guard Alan McGregor's feet, and all of Lithkow's got out at another Libington free hit.
A lot of seats fell into the Livingstone area, and they were constantly thrown out, while two penalties were asked - after the award of the ball by Halkett against the replacement player Glen Middleton and one for the hand - who were rejected.
"Excellent Game" by Livingstone - Analysis
Alexander Lammond from the BBC Scotland on Toni Macaroni Arena
Thematic performance and results for Livingstone.
All except, they were excellent, exceeding expectations in this forward course.
The style of the game and their personality changed at least after their return to top form, but the highlights should also be given to Holt for the encouragement he gave to the team with his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Halkett was excellent, returning an extremely organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joy Weirl in custody throughout the game.
On the contrary, the Rangers had no inspiration.
As good as they were in the past under the guidance of Gerard, they did not respond to these standards.
Their last game was missing - only once they managed to pass the defense of the peasants and this is a warning campaign for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the class.
Symptoms of Erdogan’s reception in Cologne
The weather was good on Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of the Heads of State of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of the contested visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which aimed at restoring relations with the allies in NATO.
They had broken up on issues such as human rights, type freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to launch a new huge mosque.
The city is hosting the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police excluded the concentration of more than 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters managed to get close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom are Kurdish origin - also gave the present, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The division of demonstrators reflects the doubtful nature of a visitor treated by some Turkish as a hero and by others as a dictator.
Three-way accident in Detford: a dead rider after a car crash
A biker lost his life in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a multi-story street in Frankfurt, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The conflict occurred a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and left a rider, who lost his life on the Chillers Street street, about 1.6 miles [1.6 km] away from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities are making efforts to identify the man and inform their closest relatives.
Roads have closed and bus routes have been blocked, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prisons: Six policemen were injured in complications
Six policemen were injured in riots that broke up in high-security prisons, according to the statements of the Prison Directorate.
The riots broke out in the prisons of this Long Lartin Majority in Worstershire about 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still in progress.
Special police forces called "Tornado" have returned to deal with the riots involving eight detainees and who appeared on one side.
The police were treated with micro-injury in the face during the complexes.
A prison representative said: "Specially trained personnel began to deal with the incident in the prisons of His Majesty Long Lartin.
Six staff members were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be brought to the police and may be subject to greater punishment."
In the prisons of this Long Lartin, more than 500 prisoners are held, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the Prison Administration was hospitalized after an attack by a detainee.
In October last year, the recovery units were called to prison to send serious incidents that broke out, during which staff members were attacked with balliards.
Rose’s Typhoon threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the areas with drought may benefit)
It is rare a tropical stretch to hit Arizona, but this is precisely likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remains of the Rosa storm will cross the southwest parts of the desert, bringing floods to their pass.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued emergency flood warning reports for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to south and east Nevada, southeast California and Yuta, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The rose typhoon is expected to pass right above Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service pointed out on its tweet that only "ten tropical cycles have remained in a tropical or low barometer situation less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a typhoon less than 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest U.S. National Tyres Centre models provide for a rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with individual rain volumes up to 6 inches in the Giant Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the South-West States, including the Central Straits and the Grey Basin, rainfalls of 1 to 2 inches are likely to occur, with the possibility of individual total rainfall volumes up to 4 inches.
For areas that are not at risk from floods, the rain brought by Rosa can be a blessing, as the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, a part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the South-West states are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Dehydration Observatory, more than 40 per cent of Arizona faces at least extreme drought, which is the second highest drought category," weather.com said.
First, the Rosa typhoon will reach the threshold at the Baha California peninsula of Mexico.
Keeping the strain of the typhoon, Sunday morning Rosa will be located 385 miles south of Puta Eugenia in Mexico with a maximum of 85 miles an hour and will move north at a speed of 12 miles an hour.
The storm will meet colder water in the Pacific and will therefore be weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the threshold in Mexico with tropical storm intensity on Monday afternoon or evening.
There may be severe rainfall in areas of Mexico, which will pose a significant risk of floods.
"There are expected total rainfall volumes of between 3 and 6 inches from Baha California to the northwest Sonora, which are likely to reach up to 10 inches", according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and reach the Arizona border early in the morning of Tuesday as a tropical low barometer, which will then pass through Arizona to reach South Yuta late in the evening of Tuesday.
"The main risk expected by the Rosa hurricane or its remains is the very severe rainfall in Baha California, the North-West Sonora and the South-West states," said the U.S. National Tyre Centre.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous heavy floods and snowflakes in the deserts and desertifications in the northern plains.
Trust in Mindsomer North: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested as suspects of attempted murder after the identification of a 16-year-old who brought knife wounds to Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Teras region of Mindsomer North, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-old, and one 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Randstock area, said the Aveon and Somerset police.
Police are calling for anyone who may have recorded on a video on his cell phone what happened.
Trab says Kavano "lived evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Kavano is a vote to reject the unrelenting and exhilarating regimes of the Democratic Party," Trab said at a meeting in Wiling in West Virginia.
Trab stated that Kavano "lived evil and anger" of the Republican Party throughout the demonstration process as a candidate.
Kavano filed in Congress on Thursday, denied categorically and with apparent incitement to the claims of Christine Blaise Ford that she was sexually assaulted decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also filed a hearing on its allegations.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw the great, the quality and the courage" of Kavano that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavano's candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent public service path," he told the majority of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to Kavano's candidacy, while he was talking about the importance of the Republicans' participation in the interim elections.
"We have five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but it's actually like I am," he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting excellent candidates."
Trab mentioned that the Republicans are on the mission of "resistance and prevention".
The first important procedural vote in Kavanos's Senate on candidacy is expected to take place at the latest on Friday, the CNN referred to a senior assistant member of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people have been killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is expected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were displaced by the giant waves that rescued the coasts, when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulavesi in Indonesia, the authorities said Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of Palau on Friday, when six - foot - high [6 m] waves hit the well, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their passage.
The tsunami occurred after 7.5 Richter earthquake.
"When the threat of tsunami occurred yesterday, the world was still on the beach and it did not run immediately, so it was hit by it," Suto Puruo Nougrocho, a representative of the Indonesia's BNPB disaster management service, told Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come only to him, it hit cars, trees, houses, it hit everything in the street," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the ocean at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people crawled into the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to the Palus 24 centers.
Aerophotographs published by the disaster management service show many damaged buildings and shops, bridges that have been destroyed and destroyed and a roof surrounded by water.
Interventions continued to affect the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Service (BPPT) reported that the energy released from the massive fall of Friday was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb that fell in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geography, which is at the end of a narrow valley, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and mentioned that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He reported that victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings that were damaged, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were ignored.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage may be greater along the coast of 300 km north of Palo, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the centre of the earthquake.
The communication systems "are completely paralysed and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"Over 300,000 people live there," Red Cross reported in his statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy and it can get even worse," he said.
A serious criticism was carried out at the Service on Saturday because it did not report that tsunami had hit Palus, although according to officials the waves had reached the time of the warning.
In a recreational video reported on social media, a man on the top of a building sounds like he's shouting a panic call trying to warn people down the road for the tsunami that's coming.
In a few minutes, a wall of water runs into the shore, pulling homes and cars.
The Reuters agency was unable to immediately check the visibility of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great interruption of the current, which also cut off communications in the wider Palus area, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts from the authorities.
The army began to send transport planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the displaced still need unknown food and other basic types of first need.
The airport of the city only reopened to contribute to the relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
A visit of President Joco Widto has been scheduled to be held at the decommissioning centres in Palos on Sunday.
The tsunami victims in Indonesia exceed 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision's staff from Dongala managed to safely reach the city of Palo, where workers found refuge in shelters from museums located in front of their office, passed through disaster scenes on their way, Mr. Dosseba said.
"They told me they saw many ruined houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some relief teams have taken the sad task of initiating the injured relief process, some complain that it did not treat strangers, particularly experienced workers in the area of relief to travel to Palus.
In accordance with the regulations of Indonesia, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from outside may only begin if the place of a contract is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It continues to be a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says it is a national disaster, we can address a request for international assistance, but there is not yet a relevant decision."
As the second day went by in Palus after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less zofer.
On Saturday, a little boy was kidnapped by an underlaw.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under a trench for two days, next to her mother's dead body.
Gedon Subandono, coach of the national elite team of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing elites for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandazi, were his students.
"As an old man in the sport of the elliptical beach, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Genton was told how, when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was released in the community of the albatross, he began sending unknown messages to his opponents at the Palus who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, the sign next to his messages was a gray symbol "n", rather than two blues.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Stealers destroyed $26,750 in the supply of automatic pick-up machine in Newport and Levi.
In the morning of Friday, thieves broke off $26,750 from Brink's employee who was making a supply of ATM machine in Newport and Levi, according to a Newport Police Department type card.
The driver had detonated an ATM machine in the entertainment facility and was preparing to deliver other money, police officer Dennis McCarthy reported on the announcement.
While he was busy, another man came running behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects leaving the scene, according to the notice, but the police didn't identify the number of people involved in the event.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport police, calling at 859-292-3680.
Kanie West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanee West is changing his name to Yee.
As he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who is officially known as Kanie West."
West, 41 years old, has been listening for a long time to the gay son and has used this nickname as a title in his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change was preceded by his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present the new album titled Yandi.
Instead of the show, the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for "sympathetic reasons", as the show's creator mentioned.
In addition to being a summary of the professional name used today, West had declared in the past that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think the word 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," West had said earlier this year in a discussion about his album title with the radio producer Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
My name changes from Kanie, which means "the only one" to Yee, which is just a reflection of the good, the evil, our confused self, of everything.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are."
It's one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sin Cobbs is known for various names, such as Pope Daddy, P.D. or D.D., but he announced this year that he prefers the names Lav and Brader Lav.
A former West partner, TZI-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without slave and capital letters.
Mexico's elected president swears he won't use the army against the citizens
Mexican elected President Mens Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn he will never use military violence against citizens, as the country is nearing the 50th anniversary of a student's blood pressure.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Plattelolko Plaza that "he will never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements gained roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador was committed to supporting the new Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people to criminal unions.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area, says the investor and professional in the field of artificial intelligence Kai-Fou Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment comes to be added to the notices of various parts of the US Government regarding artificial intelligence, as the US does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year to become the world's first country in innovation on artificial intelligence issues by 2030.
"The doubling of the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good principle, as all other countries remain so much in the USA and we are trying to make the next important discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances of taking place in the USA the next great achievement in the field of artificial intelligence, Lee said in his interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book entitled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" has released this month from the editions Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is a Director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's leading art companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an artificial intelligence system that won the best American player Othello, and later was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google Annex in China.
Lee recognised the importance of previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Romantic Challenge of the Office of Advanced Research Projects for Defence (DARPA), and wondered when the next will be carried out to identify the next viewers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the best of the academic space, it's companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university authorities to work on artificial intelligence issues in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think a green card should be offered automatically to teachers of a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Development Plan for the Next Generation Nurse in July 2017.
The National Institute of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Institute of Sciences and other government agencies share money in American researchers, but the quality of the academic project in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Center of Medical Techniques, to be joined by partners from the business and academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Military Commission on Medical Techniques.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The National Institute of Sciences of the United States today invests more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in US legislation for months in order to establish a National Committee on Safety for Artificial Medicine.
Macedonian citizens are running a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Macedonia's people participated in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country would migrate to "The Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would elect a decade-long dispute with Greece that had blocked the country's candidate for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of the northern neighbouring country represents a challenge on its territories and has exercised veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but national opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the participation would reach the required 50 per cent to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: 'You are in favour of NATO and the EU joining with the agreement with Greece'.
The advocates of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaf, argue that it is a price worth paying to try to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that arose from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the country's future, so that the young Macedonians can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because so our lives will be safer," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a number of Members of Parliament have stated that they will comply with the result of the vote in order to become final.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Committee stated that there were no reports of irregularities up to 1 m.
However, the participation reached just 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, so it gave the present 66 per cent of registered voters.
"I have come to vote for my children, our position is in Europe," said José Tanevski, 62 years old, voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoraf Zaf, Zorika's wife and son Dusko voted in the referendum on the change of the name of the country to open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in the city of Strumika of Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepares a small scene and places chairs in front of scenes set by those who will vote.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our head high, not as second-class partners," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become members of the enlarged Union."
Prime Minister Zaf said that NATO integration will bring multi-purpose investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate exceeding 20 per cent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaf said after he voted.
He said that a positive result would be "the confirmation of our future".
According to an opinion published last Monday by the PWGM's Institute of Political Research, a percentage of 30 to 43 per cent of voters, i.e. less than the required participation, would be involved in the referendum.
According to another survey conducted by the TV station Telma TV of Macedonia, 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation must reach 50 per cent together with one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow to the policy of the liberal government, from its failure to power last May.
Follow: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes all of Brighton's defense to put a bullet in it.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling ended up defending Brighton by winning 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at Etishand Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed himself to score easily in 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker took everything in the middle of the field at the beginning of the phase.
He went through three Briton defenses before he forgot the open space.
Then Agur was found surrounded by four green players.
He went through a defense with a dribble, then escaped from several others at the edge of the Great Briton area.
Then he gave everything to his left, finding Sterling.
English Squareward made his first move to the area by returning the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to win the Briton Matthew Ryan termite, scored on the right side of the grid.
"Aguero faces some problems at his feet," City's coach Pep Guardola told reporters.
"We told him to play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to score golf at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Galaxians the original advantage in the battle of Primer Lig.
This bullet came in 29 minutes.
Aguero took the ball deep into the Briton area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful bag along the left-hand side to Lary Shane.
Shane kept his ball and led Sterling back to the dock.
The furguard of the Galaxies smashed the ball into the nets just before it went out.
City faces Hoffenheim in the Chambions Lig group on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rain-Necar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to win the Rockies.
Since the Nyassionals were excluded from the loopholes, there was no reason to try to make another launch.
But the ever-competition sherger hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still any impact on the Rockies on the beach, as they advance through a game of Los Angeles Dodgers at the National League West.
The Rockies have gone to the playoff with their victory 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to lock up their first position in their category.
"A password we don't have to win, at least we can play by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will be a game of the highest level I'll face this year.
Why don't I want to fight in such a fight?"
The Nationals haven't yet announced who the original thrower will be on Sunday, but they tend to let Serger throw the ball.
Sherzer, who will make his 34th launch, made training throws on Thursday and will play Sunday, which is usually a day of rest for him.
The right hand from Washington has a performance of 18-7 with average score points (ERA) 2.53 and 300 cars due to strike at 220 2/3 periods this season.
Trab takes a speech in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation regarding his elected candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano in his speech on the importance of the Republican participation in the interim elections.
"All we've done is in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important electoral procedures in our lives.
This is a very important moment. I am not a candidate, but in fact it is like I am and, for that reason, I travel everywhere to support excellent candidates," he said.
Trab went on to say, "You see this sport, the sporty racist group of Republicans, you see what's going on right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to banish to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have taken on the mission of "resistance and prevention".
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as "serious and evil, hateful and false."
It was referred to the Judicial Committee of the House, making nominal reference to the Mayor of the Republic of Daian Fainstein, a report which was accepted with possible public approval.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you find the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for an answer, that was a really bad use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen."
The Working Party is no longer a broad extension.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
It didn't surprise me that Momentum's activists in my local team voted to cheat on me.
Furthermore, I am the last of a number of Members of the Working Party to whom they said they were not welcome, precisely why we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, had a similar attitude because he was determined to resist anti-Semitism.
In my case, my suggestion of cheating was criticized because I talked to Jeremy Corbin.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, traditionally, on similar issues to those for which Jeremy had argued with previous leaders.
The invitation to meet the workers of Southingham East on Friday said that "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone's participation".
At most of the eight-year-old who is a local Labourer, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday evenings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more flattering, more sympathetic" policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever really begun to be implemented.
It is increasingly evident that different views are not acceptable in the Working Party and that each opinion is based on whether it is acceptable by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became chief, as colleagues with whom I had previously considered that we had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 pieces and adopt views that I would never agree with, whether they were national security or the single EU market.
Every time I spoke in public, no matter what I really said, I heard an explosion in the social media, where some asked for my rejection, ran out of the centre's policy and told me I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am happier than other Members, as the comments addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a winter of sexual or racist assaults every day, but they never succumb.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time in politics is how attacks are now considered to be regular.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad extension, and that with every proposal of fraud or change of the rules of choice, the limits of the party are narrowing.
I've been advised many times over the last two years not to raise a raise, not to talk too much, and that "everything will be fine."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student, because of the neglect shown by the government of Thatser, which has literally led to the failure of my entire class, my aim was to protect better public services for those who need them most, either as a member of the local council or as a minister of the government.
I never hid my policy and did the same in the last elections.
No one in Northingham East could have been confused in any way with regard to my political views and points of conflict with today's leadership.
To those who promoted the proposal of fraud on Friday, all I have to say is that, while the country is facing a Brexit that will hurt our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, my only message is not addressed to members of the Momentum movement in Notingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political feasibility will prevent me from acting as I believe it is to the best of your all.

Air - Melrose: 38 - 17: The Inquisite Air ascends to the top
Two late goals may have distorted the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ireland was worth triumphing in this extremely peaceful modern tennis championship.
He's now at the top of the class, the only disgusting group in the ten.
Finally, it was her highest defense, as well as the best exploitation of opportunities, which made the balance for the peasants and coach Peter Murchi had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've tried our games so far and we're still being ugly, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations in Ireland, the opportunities were exploited better than we were".
Grand Anderson's ball in the 14th minute, with the conversion of Fraser Klimo, brought Air ahead, but a yellow card to Scotch José Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to exploit the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot scored a golf without conversion.
The climate increased Ireland's lead with penalty, before it scored, exactly in the mid-term, a ball with conversion, leading Ireland to the 17-5-scores.
But Melrows began the second half-yearly good and Patrick Anderson's golf, with Baggot's turn, reduced the race to five degrees.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury by Ruard Nott, who was removed from the ship, and, after the resumption, Air also increased the difference with a golf course by Stafford McDonald, with the transformation of the climate.
Deputy Chief Blair McGerson then took a yellow card, and Melrows again took advantage of the digital advantage with Bruce Calvin's gall without conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The peasants returned, however, and when Strawan Hassan took a yellow card for a taclines in the air, without the ball, from the penalty line, McGerson scored Gol in the back of the attack that Ireland had launched.
The climate has undergone a transformation, as it has done almost once again since Kyle Rowe first picked up David Armstrong's trap and sent the Extreme Gregor Henry away for the fifth golf of the peasants.
Still Game's champion starts a new career at the concentration
The Lead of the Still Game Ford Kirnan series shows ready to move to the concentration industry after it has been discovered that a director of an authorised restaurant company has been appointed.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis's role in BBC's popular show, which he's been competing with his year-old partyer at Greg Hembfield's comedy.
The couple announced that the next fifth round would be the last of the show, and it seems that Kirnan is planning his life after Geeland.
According to the official registers, he is the director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the information, although a source of Scottish Sun was alleged that Kirnan wants to deal with the "extensive concentration industry" in Glaskobia.
"The sea is ours": the closed Bolivia hopes that the court will once again open the way for peace
They're running to the fully-equipped captain of the Navy in La Paz.
In public buildings there are blue flags.
At the base of the sea from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the symptom is written: "Our sea is legally owned.
It's our duty to get her back."
In all the closed from the northern part of Bolivia, the memory of the coast of Chile after a bloody conflict for the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century remains alive, as is the desire of its people to travel to the Pacific once again.
These hopes have been raised today more than ever, for decades, as Bolivia expects the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has the dynamics, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course awaits the result with a positive look," said Roberto Calzadila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will monitor the adoption of the International Court of Justice decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favour of the Bolivian prosecution to oblige Chile, after decades of outstanding talks, to negotiate for the granting in Bolivia of a master exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic automated president of Bolivia, who gives a controversial fight for his re-election next year, has much to gain or lose from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is not possible for the court to decide in favour of Bolivia and that, even if it did, there would not be much change.
The United Nations agency in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant thousands of lands and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is to be issued just six months after the presentation of the final undertakings indicates that the case "was not complex", said Paz Zarate, Chilean specialist in international law.
And rather than further promoting the objectives of Bolivia, the past four years may have undermined them.
"The current government of Bolivia has raised the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Morales' offensive rhetoric has exhausted every remaining good mood of Chile, he supported.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk for a while, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged letters since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velgee, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision procedure was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an excellent opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility to "end up in 139-year disputes with mutual benefit", he said.
Kalzantila also denied that Morales, who still is one of the most popular leaders in Latin America, used the issue of going out to sea as a political decan.
"Volivia will never deny its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we must go beyond the past."
North Korea states there will be no nuclear disarmament, if the US cannot be trusted
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his state will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Rey spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the heads of the two states.
Rey made these comments while US Foreign Minister Mike Pompey seems ready to resume his nuclear diploma at the end, three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Young On.
Rey states that the view that the continued sanctions and the refusal of the US to declare the end of the Korean War will at some point force the North to "golden" is a hot night dream.
Washington is reluctant to agree to issue the relevant declaration if Pyongyang does not make major disarmament movements first.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trab want a second summit.
But there is widespread speculation about whether Pionjang is seriously considering declaring a weapon that the country considers likely to be the only means of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeii plans to visit Pionjang next month to prepare a second meeting of top Kim-Trab.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in oversized hats that will soon be available in a store near you
If you want to enlarge the collection of hats you have or completely avoid the sun, then stop searching.
The designers Valentino and Tom Braun presented a series of extra-large hats for their Spring 2019 collection that stole the show at the Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely impenetrable hats decomposed Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations to the pasarela.
The piece he left from Valentino was an excessive bench hat decorated with a flat chair with wings that completely covered the head of the models.
Among other super-sized accessories there were pieces decorated with stones, a magic hat, even a pineapple, but these have not been designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, over the time for Halloween.
Many of the multicolored masks had shuddered lips and were more prone to Hannibal Lekter than to high-replicity fashion.
One creation brought to mind the complete equipment of ventilators and glasses, while another resembled a molten ice in a hole.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you're lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach central commercial roads near you.
The oversized hats made their appearance very quickly after "La Boba", the dirty hat with the very very flat that we have seen wear so many, from Ryana to Emily Ratajkovsky.
The popular company that created the extremely unscrupulous hat that exposed social media sent another great creation to the pasarela, a dirty beach bag almost as large as the model it wears by wearing its wizard.
The dark orange bag of raffia, decorated with raffia hair and a white leather handle, was the piece that left from the collection of La Raviera Spring-Calcoma 2019 by Jacquemus in the fashion week in Paris.
The space designer, Luke Armitaz, said in column FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and large beach bags at the shops next summer, as the designer made so much sense that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excess accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have a prehistory to academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with a further series of excellent results in the examinations, which have simply been further reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are struggling to provide the best possible level of service to their students and parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher education levels, the career they will choose as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a school curriculum by order, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable choice lesson in schools.
Nelson Madela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, then what you say goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, what you say goes to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot simply rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
On the basis of the recent results of the annual surveys, we find that languages are at the top of performance tables, with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who learned foreign languages achieved a degree of abstinence A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of the students achieved degree A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also had degree A.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are considered equally important as they relate to science, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the U.S. Employment and Skills Committee in 2014 revealed that, as regards the reasons why employers were difficult to cover job vacancies, a 17 per cent percentage of language skills were missing.
Therefore, the need for language skills is becoming increasingly urgent for young people to be prepared for their future career.
Since more future employment opportunities require language skills, these skills are necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that one will choose, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future because of this ability that he can use throughout his life.
If anyone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouTube in more than 4,000 adults in the USA in 2013, 75 per cent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to engage in a discussion, while French was the only language that spoke a double percentage of respondents (15 per cent).
That is why investment in language teaching is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of the developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find employment in a meaningful way.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the 2020 U.S. with horizons such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be several languages to choose from independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
The independent schools in Scotland provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve, whatever their future.
No one today can deny that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and openness to the young people of Scotland.
They have to.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
Lembron will make his debut at Lakers on Sunday at San Diego.
The wait for lovers who are waiting to see Lebron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers Luke Walton's coach announced that James was going to play Sunday in the first game before the game against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes it will play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudel wrote on Twitter that James is probably gonna play for a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James was asked about his plans for the six games that the Lakers have to give before the competition period.
"I don't need preparations at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
The Trab concentration in West Virginia, Canal YouTube
President Donald Trab starts a series of meetings starting with the Wilding of West Virginia.
This is the first of the first five planned concentrations of Trab next week, which includes periods in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming his election for the Supreme Court to be in wait, the Trab seeks to strengthen public support for the upcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress by the November vote.
What time is Trab's concentration in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trab concentration in Wilding in West Virginia is scheduled for 7 μm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trab concentration in West Virginia online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trab is likely to be referred to in the hearings this week for the candidate for the position in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, which were made in a tense atmosphere due to allegations of sexual misconduct, with a vote of confirmation by the Senate that has been pending for up to a week while the FBI's investigation is under way.
However, the primary objective of this series of mergers is to help Republicans who face an amphibious outcome in the November elections in order to gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trab's campaign said that these five meetings next week aim at "mobilising volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority of the representatives in the Senate and Parliament," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical to its agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible, as we travel to the multi-school campaign period," a representative of the Trab campaign said to Reuters, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The planned gathering tonight at Wesbanco Arena in Wiling could bring supporters from "Ohaio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month that Trab visits West Virginia, the country that won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trab is trying to help Patrick Morrisei, Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, which is low in polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost to the helmets," said Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has the nerve to fight by keeping hope alive as it travels to the singles of Sunday
After three single-side games, Saturday's squares may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The talented tailing of the tail is a completely meant sports idea, but the players believe it deeply, and especially in such dimensions.
Where would they say the line is now?
"There were six steps ahead, and now there are four, so we probably have a little tail," Jordan Smith said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, going four steps ahead and remaining twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spith says, feel the "air on their beaches" and have plenty to encourage them, like the two Spith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one had three degrees out of the four.
Spyth was mortal from tea to green and gave the example.
The voices of the raids became more powerful as he continued his round, reaching a critical blow to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The hit they won in the 15th was accompanied by similar demonstrations that show his conviction that the American team is not out.
"You have to look deep inside and worry about your game," Spyth said.
That's what every player has left.
18 holes to write a story.
The only players with more degrees than Spy and Thomas in the last two days are Francis Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the irrefutable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but precious two of Europe has succeeded four in four and it seems that it does nothing wrong.
The "Molywood" was the only twin that didn't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also escaped bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way in which the energy appears to be flowing towards and from the noisy viewers, underlines the fact that it is the players who should win Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Flitwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun goes over Le Golf National.
I would prefer both at the same time at different doors.
The debate on European honour remains early.
Baba Watson and Webb Simpson put the glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front nine they had Spain and Sweden so deep in a hole they couldn't get out of it.
Sunday, however, there will be no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so exciting to watch them closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome game has also shown that the U.S. team has the bones, despite the doubts of some.
Europe takes the ride 10-6 the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after its race at the fourballs and Saturday's foursomes with 10-6 against the USA.
Tommy Flitwood and Francis Molinari's inspired twin applied two wins against a racing Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead at Le Golf National so far at four degrees.
The European side of Thomas Byrne, who is trying to maintain the trap he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the failed American side of the morning fourball, with a 3-1 series.
The U.S. were more opposed to the foursomes, winning two matches, but they couldn't cover the difference.
Jim Furick's side needs eight degrees from the 12 single Sunday matches to keep the trap.
Flitwood is the first European emerging player to win four degrees series, while with Molinari, also known as "Molywood", after a devastating weekend, is just the second two that wins four degrees in the first four matches in the story of Ryder Cup.
Having destroyed Woods and Patrick Reid at the fourballs, they joined their forces to destroy a tired Woods and the American emerging Brison DeSampo with an even more striking 5-4-4.
Woods, who played in the two Saturday matches, showed occasional lightning explosions, but has lost more than 19 of his 29 matches in fourball and foursome and seven series.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning fourball, returned to Henry Stanson's match for the 2-1-story foursomes of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, winning the first and third rankings in the world.
They did not all go well for Europe, despite the pleasant, rainy day in southwestern Paris.
The three times winner Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas set up a two-degree game for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a hard win 2+1 on John Ram and Ian Poulter of Spain at fourballs and returned later to win the Poulter and Rory Mikilroy 4&3 at the foursomes while they had lost the two doors at the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a group could recover while losing four degrees in singles, although because it's the stepfather, Furick's enough to achieve equality to keep the trophies.
However, after being found in second place for two days, it seems that a contradiction on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not be disarmed alone without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions are deepening the feeling of distrust against the United States and that his country is not going to leave its nuclear weapons alone under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual general meeting of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "significant good will measures" last year, e.g. the cessation of nuclear and ballistic tests, the decommissioning of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the USA," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to start our disarmament alone."
While Rei repeated a well-known complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the possibility of a "stable" approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea will be awarded as a step-by-step step in the process, his statement was important that it did not completely exclude mononuclearization, as Pionjang did in the past.
Rei referred to Kim Young On and Donald Trab's public announcement at the first summit that took place between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on "the underprivilegedization of the Korean peninsula", while the Trab promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is trying to officially end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first "run" its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the calls for the release of the severe international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. continues to become "first denuclearisation" and increases pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve their goal by exorbitating them, even putting obstacles to the "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The realization that sanctions can be passed on to us is a dream that they don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our disbelief."
Ri made no reference to a planned second summit between Kim and Trab, which the US leader pointed out earlier this week to the United Nations.
The minister, however, noted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Je-in over the past five months and added: "If the partner on the issue of de-nuclearisation was South Korea and not the USA, de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such an outage."
Still, the tone of Rei's speech was very different from yesterday, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the goal of the US home country with ballistic missiles in North Korea was inevitable because the "Bad President" Trab called Kim "fireman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trab, who threatened last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, fought Kim's commitment to his courage to move forward with disarmament measures, but declared that there must be still much to be done and that sanctions should remain in force until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trab said he had no timetable for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia support that the UN Security Council should compensate for the measures it has taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and incessantly until complete, final and confirmed denuclearisation is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously approved the 2006 North Korean sanctions in an effort to eliminate the financing of Pionjang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pionjang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pionjang in July saying that progress had been made to report to North Korea a few hours later that he had "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea was committed in meeting with Mun this month to detonate a missile facility and also a nuclear compound if the United States took "opposite measures".
He explained that Kim told him that the "opposite measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trab had promised in Singapore and were promoting the balance of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are watching lessons about how to relax enough
This year, a new study at Harvard University seeks to increase the number of successful students sleeping more in an effort to combat the growing crop of the night study with the consumption of many caffeine.
One academic discovered that students at the number 1 university often don’t know basic things, for example how to take care of themselves.
Charles Tyler, professor of breathing medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the lesson, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the lesson after a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came and said to me, "Why do I know that right now in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me," The Telegraph said.
The lesson, which began for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performances, as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Bareira, professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to include the lesson when it was found that students were falling asleep within the week to a significant extent.
Time learning includes a series of interactive work.
In one unit there is the image of a student student, where students click on cups of coffee, dishes, sports shoes and books, to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performances are affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep routine.
In another unit, participants learn how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of inflammation, brain, depression and cancer.
A university map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change students' behavior directly.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the effects on health when you choose to smoke," Professor Tyler added.
His culture to be proud of because you studied all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a problem that is ingested.
The sufficient sleep, good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep loss puts the brain in a state of lime, resulting in a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old caliph studying Chemicals and Physical Biology, helped Professor Tyler design the lesson, following one of his classes last year's first year at Harvard.
He said his lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to press for a lesson in the entire university.
The next step, hopefully, is to ask all graduate students to follow a similar programme before starting their studies at this particularly competitive educational institution.
Professor Tyler recommended that students regulate a warning about the time they should go to sleep, as well as a wake-up watch, and that they know the harmful consequences of the "Blue Light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can decouple the crunchy rate, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga's putting golf at Gerard's men
The Rangers had another sad out-of-the-story attack, as Dolly Menga's south led Steven Gerard's uncoordinated side to one-to-one attack in Libington.
Ibrox's team wanted to mark her first off-the-board victory from the February triumph with 4-1 in St. Johnstown, but Gary Holt's team just caused Gerard's second year in 18 games as a coach, leaving the team eight degrees behind the Cards, which is the first in the ranking of the Ladbrokes championship.
Menga hit seven minutes before the mid-term and the invincible ranger of the Rangers seemed unable to respond.
While Raingers is now falling in sixth place, Livingston ascends to the third, with just one gall of difference from the previous Hibernian.
And Raingers can expect other trouble, as Superintendent Kalum Svens needed first aid for head injury caused by an object that was thrown from the front.
Gerard made eight changes to the team's composition and destroyed Air to the semi-finals for the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same composition "Libe 11" that took a degree from the Card last week and would be happy with how this cool machine could drown every effort of the opponents.
Raingers may have ruled in possession, but Livingston did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when Menga's first long distance was sending Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the medium didn't find the ball.
A deep-seated kit of Kigan Jacobs found Chief Craig Halket, but his defense officer Alan Littgow's only thing he could do was send the ball away from the dock.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morellos certainly believed that he should have won a pen at 15', as he was confronted with Steven Loules, but the dissident Steven Thompson ignored Colombian complaints.
Raingers had only two shots in the area in the first half, but Ibrax's former security officer Liam Kelly didn't worry about Lasana Kulimbali's head and Ovi Ezzaria's submarine.
Although Libya was clearly below expectations in the first 34 minutes of the match, no one can deny that it was worth the effort.
And again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Dean Gallagher hit the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept his cold and found Menga who just completed the effort.
Gerard made changes in the mid-term by taking out Kulimbali and putting Ryan Kent. The change almost immediately, as the extrem passed the ball to Morellos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingston has continued to drag the guests into the style of the game that he knows and enjoys, with the Lithkou and Halkett to remove one far after the other.
Holt's side could have increased the difference to the end, but McGregor faced Jacobs in the same way, stopping him before Lithkow's attempt on the corner.
Raingers' alternate, Glen Midleton, had another phase for penultimate to the end, as he was confronted with Jacobs, but still Thompson ignored it.
Almanac: The inventor of Goiger's coin
A page from the German Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: like today, 136 years ago and VALE ... the day in Germany was born the future natural John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, which eventually led to the device that is now known as the Goiger meter.
Science Pilon since then, the meter Geiger passed through the sphere of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with the winners of the amazing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Andras: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Goiger meter used to detect radioactive metal elements, such as the sky.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of the people caused by radioactivity in the metal elements."
Evans, "Look, he's acting crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name continues her work.
New anticancer vaccine teaches the immune to "see" the problem cells
New anticancer vaccine teaches the immune to "see" the problem cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immunosuppressive to recognise the problem cells during treatment
The method includes the export of immune cells from the patient and their modification to the laboratory
They can "see" a protein that is common to various types of cancer and then become their reinjection
A test vaccine has hopeful results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received treatment with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the problem cells saw her ovaries cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the export of immune cells from the patient, their modification to the laboratory so that they "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then the re-injection of the cells.
Professor J. Berzofski, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very hopeful vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzofski explained, protein HER2 "is the engine power for the development of several types of cancer", such as breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and fat.
A similar approach to which patients are exported immunocytes and then "learn" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanie West was attacked by Trab, wearing a hat with the MAGA signal, after his appearance in the SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanie West was awarded at the studio during a Saturday Night Live following a foreign interview with US President Donald Trab and said he would run a candidate in the 2020 elections.
After presenting the third song for the night, entitled Ghost Town, wearing a baseball hat with the slogan Make America Great Again (To Do America's Great Again), he gave a reticence to the Democrats and repeated his support to the Trab.
"I talk to someone white many times and he says, "But how do you like the Trab?
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
SNL opened with a sketch in which Matt Damon, with Hollywood's star, competed with Bret Kavano's testimony before the Court of Justice's Committee on the complaints of Christine Blazi Ford about sexual abuse.
Although it was not broadcast, the video with West's cover was uploaded to social media by Comedy Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to intercept West with this hanging.
West also protested to the public that he was not treated well because of his hat.
"They made me bulling in the front door.
They said, "Don't go out with the hat."
I'm being bulling!
And they say I don't know what's going on with me," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on, "I don't know what's going on with me, I'm gonna wear the superman's coat, so no one can tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were recognized at least twice by the public and SNL's factors appeared to be in a difficult position, Variety said, with a person saying in the magazine: "The whole studio had a dead end."
West was called a replacement of the last time the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had escaped a few days earlier.
West confused enough when he sang the I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West supported Katas Turner, head of the TPUSA conservative team, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest spirits: IN THE EHLO ANTISTOMY."
However, the show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "his own and that's great".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") who believes that he is insinuating and exhibiting an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
The same is true of us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was "the one previously known as Kanie West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Deedy's steps, also known as Pope Daddy, Pafi and P. Deedy.
The rapper Snow Doug had changed his name to Snow Lion and, of course, the hero of the music Prince had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Know As Prince.
Murder attempt category for assault by knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old was charged with attempted murder after a knife attack on a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Balikamor, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Prosecutor.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, criticises the toxic fertility
Kitt Harington is known for the role of Chief John Snow in the violent medium-sized HBO fantasy series, the Game of Thrones.
However, the actor, 31 years old, determines the stereotype of the hero, saying that such roles on the screen pass the message to the little boys that it should be hard to gain respect.
Speaking in The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Keith said that "something goes wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic fertility can be fought at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his rival at the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted to having a "strong view" on the matter.
"Personally, now, I think so. Where did we make the mistake with the pregnancy?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing the toxicity of the infant due to the emerging characteristics.
He continued: "What is implanted and what is taught?
What does it teach on television and on the streets, making young boys feel that they should show such behavior to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
There's certainly something wrong with our young people."
In the interview it was also accepted that it does not intend to play at any prequel or sequel of the Game of Thrones, after the end of the series next summer, saying "end in the battles and horses".
Since November, Kit will be taking the lead in reviving Sam Separd's True West project, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that his acquaintance with Rose's wife is the best thing he's ever done since the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so somehow she lost my future family and my life from here on," she said.
Rose was stabbed by Eggriet, John Snow's romantic seductive character, Keith, in the award-winning Emmy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at the Lesley family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 some 40,000 new outbreaks were reported.
In their overwhelming majority, new problems were transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spread rapidly in certain parts of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost disappeared, as said leaders of the Chinese health sector at a convention in the province of Yunan.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the Chinese LOAT community.
Homophilia was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LOAT community remains a common phenomenon.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these patients are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised global access to HIV drugs in an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Watters denies that the official has been breaching the data of the Republicans, condemning the "dangerous lies" and the "consensual ideas"
This Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Watters filed the allegations that a member of her staff published personal information from three Republican elders on the legislation's Wikipedia pages.
The Republican Member of Los Angeles supported that the allegations were promoted by commentators and websites of the "right end".
"False, lie and even more awful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes the housing addresses and phone numbers of Mayors Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatt of Yuta.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and appears to have been published by an unknown person from the environment of Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Committee of the Senate on allegations of sexual offences against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano.
The leak happened sometime after the three growers had questioned Kavano.
Conservatives, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the reports was related to the Waters office and published the data of a member of the Waters staff, reported The Hill.
"This unwarranted claim is completely false and outright lies," Watters continued.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these false and false claims, was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unwarranted claim is a completely false and false lie."
The Waters statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, including by former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleiser.
"This reading is filled with anger," wrote Flesser.
"This shows he doesn't have the right to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be a coward.
He must not question the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleiser seemed to compare the Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanos, who was accused by his critics of being very angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to bribe Waters in the middle elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's true," tweeter.
In her statement, Watters mentioned that her office had notified "the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these false claims".
"We will do everything we can to find those responsible," he continued, "and to account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."
Review of the film Johnny English Reprints - a subtonic spectacle film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to search for Brexit's marks in every new British movie and this seems to apply to this revitalization of the Franchise of Comedy Action Films with the hero Johnny English, which started in 2003 with the film Johnny English and returned in 2011 with the film Johnny English: The Return.
Can this humorous self-satisfaction about how clearly we are at a loss to become the new opportunity for the nation's exports?
In any case, the uncanny Johnny English with his eyes shuddered could renew his permission to make a mandrakes for the second time. His name says it is a wider comical creation designed for non-English cinematographic theatres.
This is, of course, the Azamom secret agent who, while pretending to have the light and the ways of a secret agent, brings a little to Clouseau, with a dose of "Mr. Bin" and something from the guy who played one and only south on the music theme of the film The Roads of Fire at the start of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on the traveling and international mystery man that Atkinson was once exposed to Barclaycard's most forgotten television ads, pushing the chaos into his passage.
There are one or two good times in this last J.E. movie.
I liked it when Johnny Ingles approached a helicopter dressed in mediocre armor and the helicopters hit his skull.
Atkinson shows his talent in the comedy, however, humour is quite subtle and strange, especially when "serious" film franchise such as the 007 and Hazardous Mission now includes several comic elements.
The humor seems to be addressed to children and not adults, and in my opinion, Johnny England's crazy rides aren't as inspiring and relevant as the Ackinson's type of Bingson movie sketches.
The eternal central issue is that Britain has a serious problem.
A governor has hacked into the super secret Internet network of British spies, bringing to the fore the identity of all British agents on mission, to the great disappointment of the agent in service, whom Kevin Eldon is led into a unfortunately small role for his benefactors.
It is the last stage for a ambitious and ambitious prime minister who is at the forefront of the collapse because of political anti-discrimination: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the scenario does not help her in particular.
The information consultants shall inform her that, as each active specimen has been discovered, it should return to someone who has been disembarked.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a director at an aristocrat school, but gives unfavourable lessons for secret agents: there are some nice scenes here, as England offers an Academy of A School of Rock.
England returns to Whitehall for urgent information and reconnects with Buff's former and patient partner, whom Ben Miller is still undergoing.
Buff is now married to a commandant underpants, a crazy role in which Vicki Perperdin is not fully used.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the Chief of Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful and partial Benefit of Boulettova that Olga Kirilenko is being subjected to.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being lured by the charming billion-dollar technology that claims it can solve Britain's technological dynasties: the threatening Jason Volta, whom Jake Lacey is being subjected to.
Ingleis and Buff begin their pharsocomodomy: transformed as a waiter, put fires in a shallow French restaurant, cause chaos as they try to smuggle illegally into Volta's luxury yachts, and Ingelis causes anarchy as he tries to use an iconic reality device to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as dignified as it is, and if it is, it still remembers a little child TV.
A lot of things.
And like the other movies Johnny English I wonder: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he'll really grow up with his talent?
Workers lie that they are considering a plan to work the British four-day, but to be paid for five-monthly.
Jeremy Corbin's Working Party is going to consider a radical plan to work British four days a week, but to be paid for five-year work.
The party, according to information, seeks the company’s owners to conduct the savings achieved through the return of artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers by giving them an additional day off.
Thus, workers will enjoy a three-day weekend without any reduction in their wages.
Sources indicate that the idea coincides with the economic agenda and the party's plans in order to return the balance for the workers.
The four-week change was approved by the Labour Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A higher source from the Labour Party said in The Sunday Times: "A change of policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but the four-day working week is a ambition that is geared towards bringing the party closer to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as the overall strategy of the party for industry."
The Working Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its general pre-election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the whole Labour Party.
A representative of the Working Party said: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not examined by the party".
The secretary of the shadow government, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to develop his vision for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonel said he was determined to regain power from the "personal directors" and the "profit-makers" in the public benefit companies.
The plans of the secretary of the shadow government also mean that today's shareholders in the water companies may not take back their entire share, as a potential government of the Workers could carry out "sponsorships" due to suspicious attacks.
It also confirmed plans for the placement of employees in company boards and the creation of mutual participation funds to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who will receive annual shares up to 500 UK sterlings.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking at the 60-minute show about whether the FBI investigation into Kavano could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanos has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the decisions of the service could affect some Republican supervisors to withdraw their support.
At his Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, a 60-minute broadcast responder, asked the Republican growers John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could cancel anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, it does," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out in the court, and I asked him straight away, "Did you do it?"
He was an amethyst, determined, categorical.
However, Graham's vote seems to be not going to change.
"I've decided on Brett Kavano and I'm gonna need some kind of explosives to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected it strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazi Ford.
"And whoever has named it can't confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and famous stars, as well as an equally impressive mission: eradicating global poverty.
For a seventh year now, tens of thousands are scheduled to go to the Great Lawn in Central Park in the framework of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardie Be and Saint Ments, but also to make themselves aware of the real goal of the event, which is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of those struggling actively against it.
In order to secure a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as declaring volunteers, send an email to a world leader, call or find other essential ways to help raise awareness about their goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of the reward with a free concert the right way to convince our citizens to take action or is it just another case of the so-called "clicking" when some feel that they really make the difference by signing an electronic request or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen Group has reported that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, promoting a number of different objectives.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and notifications as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or concentrated.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British investor and contractors' union, which has taken the commitment "to help children fully exploit their potential", promising to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to eliminate bribery, having received over 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of subsidiary a point in history," said Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, in the public during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following the 5,000 actions and calling on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project called The Power of Nutrition, which is directed at 5 million women and children with food interventions.
Answering the question "What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?" which is included in the frequent questions on the website,
a member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the great moves on human rights and on the subject before us, we will succeed, because we are more united.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Son Ments, Cardy Bee and Janell Mona are some of the artists that will appear at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Debora-Le Farnes and Hio Jakman.
The US can use the Navy to "exclusion" by preventing Russia's energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington can turn "if necessary" into its Marine Warship in order to prevent the availability of Russian energy in markets, including the Middle East, as US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reasons why they are in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said according to information.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the support of the Marine War, to ensure that the maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to exclude them, in order to ensure that Russian energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke was addressed to participants in the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is described as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He agreed on Washington's approach to addressing Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, a little bit too much, the exploitation and replacement of fuels," said Russia, referring to "pain that only knows a trick," as it has an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made as the Trab administration has taken the mission to strengthen exports of US liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper choice for European consumers.
For this reason, the administration of the Trab, including President Donald Trab himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "appropriate" project for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to the Trab, will make Berlin a "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project with a budget of $11 billion, which is going to double the existing capacity of pipelines into 110 billion cyber measures, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington’s strong resistance to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude led to the reaction of Germany, which stressed its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany's top industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kevf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider declaring candidate for the presidency in 2020, Masahuset's gardener says
Masahuset's mayor, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that he would seriously examine the possibility of declaring presidential candidates after the interim elections.
At a meeting at the Holiouk headquarters in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and correct our troubled government, and that is why a woman is needed at the top," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will examine the possibility of a candidate for the Presidency."
Warren criticised President Donald Trab during the meeting, saying that "it leads the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trab is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren didn't smack her words about Trab and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano.
On a Friday tweet, Warren said that "of course it is necessary to investigate the FBI before the vote".
A review published on Thursday, however, showed that the vast majority of Warren's voters do not believe that they should put a presidential candidate in 2020.
58% of Massachusetts's "probable" voters said that the grower should not apply, according to a review by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% were in favour of such a candidacy.
The review has shown more support for a possible candidate than former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a possible candidate and 48% in favour.
Other popular names from the Republicans who have been discussed in connection with a possible candidate for 2020 are former vice-president Joe Baiden and Archbishop Bernie Sanders of Bermuda.
Baiden said he would have decided officially until January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Peelin referred to Trac Peelin's Transforming Strait Disorder at Donald Trab's Concentration
Trac Pelin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his campaign in September.
Arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"With what my son has been going through since he came back, I can understand other families living with the effects of the Strait of Trauma and the injuries that our soldiers carry when they return to their homeland," he told the public in the context of a gathering for Donald Trab in the Gulf of Oklahoma.
Peelin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said about her son and other veterans that "they return a little different, return harder, return askers if there is respect for what soldiers, aircraft and any other member of the army have done for the country."
She was arrested on Monday in Alaska and accused of domestic violence against a woman, an intervention in reference to domestic violence and armed robbery while in mid-term status, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the police department of Guasila.
18 states and the region of Colombia support the question of new asylum policy
Ten states and the region of Colombia support a legal challenge to the new US policy which refuses to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape from alliances or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the region submitted a report on Friday's friend curiae in Washington, supporting an asylum-seeker to question politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the defendant in Grace v. Seison's treatment submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August has not been revealed against federal policy.
He said her "and her violent sons who are members of the community" had abused her, however, US officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
He was held in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Greece described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States come, as countries facing severe problems with alliances and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy contradicted the 2014 decision taken by the Migration Decision Commission (BIA) and allowed undeclared immigrants fleeing situations of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Carl Rasin, said Friday that the new policy "is missing all decades of civil, federal and international law".
"In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application. Such a breach violates this principle," in the report amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued that the policy that denies entry to immigrants is detrimental to the US economy, claiming that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "successful labour force".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sécion ordered the immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape situations of domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political opinion," the session declared in its statement on 11 June.
The purpose of the asylum was never to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious) people face every day in the world.
Unrecognised rescue efforts in Palus, as the number of dead is doubled despite the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was constantly worsening.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old mother Rizza Kusuma, trying to relieve her baby who had fever, in a decommissioning center that had been placed in the devastated city of Palau.
"Every minute the nurses bring other bodies.
The clean water is sprinkling."
Some residents have taken steps to return to their damaged homes and to collect their existing resources through the water, trying to fill in what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which suffered damage from the 7.5-scale Richter earthquake, were unable to cover the needs.
Some wounded, such as Dui Harris, who suffered from middle and shoulder fractures, stayed outside the Palus Army Hospital, where the first aid was given to the outside because of continued strong movements.
The tears poured down his eyes as he explained how he felt about the violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then she remained silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "fearing" with "propaganda advertisements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four - page advertisement in a daily U.S. newspaper overcoming the mutual commercial benefits between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trab reported last Wednesday on China Daily's on-paid set-up that appeared at the Des Moines Register, the newspaper with most sales in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in Congress's elections on 6 November, a category that China refuses.
Trab's claim that Beijing has been involved in the US elections marked what US officials reported on Reuters that it is a new phase of the escalating campaign that Washington has launched in order to exert pressure on China.
Although it is not prohibited for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalating trade war and have imposed several duties on imports.
China’s trade defences at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at harming exporters in countries such as Iova, who supported the Republican Party of Trab, referred to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Brandt, US Ambassador to China and former long-term governor in Iowa, a state that is an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Brand wrote in an opinion article at the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is in danger of this kind of intimidation by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press".
"In the effort to spread this propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the precious tradition of freedom of speech and the free press of America, publishing on a paid advertisement at the Des Moines Register," Branstant wrote.
"On the contrary, in the vicinity of Beijing, you will find minimal derogatory voices and no real representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, since the media are under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers escaped the offer to publish" his article, although he did not reveal which.
The Republicans dismiss women voters in respect of the interim elections because of the Fiasco with Kavanos, analysts warn
As many top Republicans continue to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano despite complaints of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a reaction, especially from women, in the forthcoming interim elections.
Feelings about this issue are particularly intense and most Republicans have said they would like to move forward with the vote.
These things can't be recovered," Grand River, professor of Political Sciences at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
River has doubts that the recent move by Mayor Jeff Flake (R-Arisona) to request an investigation by the FBI will be sufficient to attract angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, are not going to forget it tomorrow, and are certainly not going to forget it in November," said Karen Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national press representative of the MoveOn Progressive Group, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators regularly called the symptom "November is coming!" at the parish hall as the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission gave the green light for Kavano's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazie Ford, mentioned Mic.
"The excitement and motivation of the Democrats will reach record level," said St. Rodenburg, an uncompromising political analyst, on the news site.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of women's indisputable voters in the forts and younger voters, aged 18 to 29 years who, while opposed by the president, often do not vote."
Even before the Ford's public submission, in which he described in detail her complaints about sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, the analysts had predicted that there might be a reaction if the Republicans proceed with the money.
"It's a huge mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the National Committee of the Republicans, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about voting in the committee or about the final vote or whether Kavano will be put out. It also has to do with how the Republicans handled the issue and how it was brought up," said Gai Cecil, director of the Group of Priorities USA, who is assisting in the election of the Republicans.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the deposits of Fort and Cabano, slightly more in favour of the second.
A new YouTube review shows that 41% of the respondents were either likely to believe in Ford's deposit, while 35% said they were probably or probably believed in Kavano.
In addition, 38% said that he believed that Kavan probably or certainly lied to his deposit, while 30% said the same about Ford.
After Fleic's move, the FBI began investigating Ford's complaints and at least another complainant, Debora Ramirez, mentioned the Guardian.
Last week, Ford filed a plea before the Court of Justice that her Kavano was attacked while she was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her births while they were at a party, when both of them were studying in Gail in the 1980s.
World East Inventor plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World East, starts a startup with the aim of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new tip of this technology heroship is Inrupt, a company based on the Berners Lee Open Solids platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who can have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Bernards Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology by allowing users to create their own "personal electronic data storage space" or a POD.
It can contain lists of contacts, lists of work options, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify to be all available in a browser program and all these at the same time.
The only feature of the personal data storage space is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this option "personal strengthening through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's management consultant, John Bruce, is the company to offer resources, procedures and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is made up of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some involved programmers who worked in the project and a community of volunteer code programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lee said his team and his team didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether they're allowed to make radical changes, twisting business models into one night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a publication in the Medium released on Saturday, Bernards Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and a ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Technical Institute of Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months, Berners Lee has had a strong voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about the next time on the Internet," Bernards Lee added.
Bernard Van: Tax of honor to a lawyer who received the Victorian Stock Exchange in World War I
The only heir of the Anglican Church who has received the Stairs of Victoria during World War A as a soldier was honored in the homeland of 100 years later.
Vice-President Bernard Van received the metal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a free target four days later and never learned that he had spread the highest British military distinction.
On Saturday, the discoveries of a memorial plaque were made by his two grandchildren, who were accompanied by a raid at the Rasden of Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was an "excellent symbol" that the album's discoveries were made exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act of taking the metal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vice-President Van led his team to the San Ken Canal in a very dense fog and was given strong firearms from war and volleyball."
Later, he jumped into the front line and with "excellent manhood" he led the line forward, before hitting himself with a weapon of battle three of the wreckage.
Vice-President Van was killed by a German free man on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72 years old, said his grandfather's heroic actions were "something I know I could never get to, it's something that makes you feel immeasurable respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also placed a furnace after the passage, led by the new Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he "felt a great deal of appreciation for the absence" and added that "the manhood of a real hero is proved by the support he has from many people."
MMA's fans had a night to watch Bellator 206, but they saw Pope Wurunaki
Think of the following scenario: you have had a night to watch the exciting Bellator 206, but you are happy to see this unique sporting event.
The San Jose programme included 13 matches, including six in the main card, and would be planned live in the United Kingdom, from Channel 5, to the night zone.
At 6:00 p.m., as Gegard Mussai and Rory McDonald were preparing to go out in the ring, the viewers in the United Kingdom remained calm when the show changed Peppa's Wurunaki.
Some did not like it at all, as they had stayed awake until the first morning especially for the fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the children's program as "a kind of sick joke".
"In accordance with the legislation, this content was not suitable for 6 a.m., so the children's programme should be planned," said Dave Svarts, senior vice-president of Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the Wuunaki, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Koker, said they are going to process the programme in order to include the United Kingdom's views in the future.
"If we think about the ripples, I think we can make it," Koker said.
"But there are six Sunday mornings there and we will not be able to do so until our Sundays, i.e. their own Mondays.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the change happened, a lot of messages were exchanged back and forth and it wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you that next time something like this is not going to happen.
We're gonna limit it to five matches instead of six, as we usually do.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt "last" because of his sexuality
Olympiac in the ravages, Tom Dale, said that he grew up feeling less than the rest because of his sexuality, however, moved him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until high school that "they're not all like me."
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Lavern on Radio 4, he said he supported the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also said that since he became a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Yang, a regular presentation of known radio broadcasts, was for several months on sick leave.
As invited to Lavern's first show, Dale said she felt "inadequate" compared to others when she was growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity have given me the strength and desire to achieve."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said not to disappoint anyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The Olibionikis Halkin twice is a defender of the rights of the Loatiki community and has taken part in the annual Community Competitions in Australia to call for more countries to move towards decriminalisation of homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live open, unaffected, and that he wanted to give hope to others.
The three times a world champion said it was "a surprise" when a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lans Black, was in love with him in 2013.
Dale married Oscar Dustin Lans Black last year, who is 20 years older than he was, but he argued that the age difference was never a matter.
"When you spend so much in such a small age" (he first participated in Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find someone who has similar good and bad moments."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Dellie, and Daley said he changed "all his prospects".
"If you asked me last night, all I wanted was to win the gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than gold Olympic metals.
My gold Olympic metal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had taken tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "Dad, you wouldn't be near us to sit in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing only when he stopped breathing and was dead I finally accepted that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Dale won the 2012 Olympics and won the metal medal.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life, fighting the defeats of the Olympic Games in my home country, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of the first song, the Proud of Heather Small, which frozen him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still causes him to be shocked.
Desert Island Discs broadcast on BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Except for Michaelson to sit on the bench on Saturday at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Michelson will score a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he's gonna have to improve his performance so he doesn't remember him for the wrong reasons.
Mikkelson, who participates for the 12th time (record number) in the games held every two years, was forced by Chief Jim Furik to sit on the bench for the fourballs and the foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as usual for the United States, five times the winner divided the day to get excited by the lines and "work" his game hoping to correct his problems.
Without there has ever been the most straightforward driver even in the area of his career, the 48-year-old game is not suitable for the close field of Le Golf National, where the remotes are often problematic.
And as if the difficulty of the field had not been met, Mikelson, in one Sunday's fight, faces Francesco Molinari, British Open's champion, who is working with the leading Tommy Flipwood to win their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four degrees below the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, the game of Mitchell may be critical.
Furick expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he's playing today, he punched me in the back, put his hand around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has great self-esteem.
His name is in the Hall of Fame and has offered too much in these groups, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't count on him to play two games.
I was thinking more, but we ended up there and we thought we should go.
He wants to go out there, just like everyone else."
Michaelson's gonna go beyond Nick Faldo's record for most of the Sunday matches at Ryder Cup.
He could have meant the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that didn't reach the height of his individual record.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 matches and seven and a half, although Furick said his presence benefited the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he likes to make jokes and he's great in the group room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also had fun bothering him this week.
His contribution is not just in the game."
The leader of the European team, Thomas Byrne, knows that the great advance can soon be lost.
Thomas Byron, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a great advance starting from the singles of the last day at Ryder Cup can easily be turned into a pot.
Danos made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama game, where a team with Seve Ballesters managed to get five degrees above the Americans, but only after he managed to cross the finish line with different breasts, winning 141⁄2-131.2.
"You always remember that we had a great lead in Valderrama, we had a great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just after violence," said Byron, in the picture, after monitoring the 2018 generation to win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show to me and all the members of the team that this is not over.
We're gonna go get ready tomorrow to give it all.
We'll get out there and play right.
Nothing's over until you see the grades on the table.
We have a goal, to win this trap, and there we focus.
I always say I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we know very well that the other team also has good players – the best in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of its players in a difficult golf course, Byrne adds: "I wouldn't rush to predict the outcome.
Tomorrow's another animal.
Tomorrow is measuring individual performance and that's something different.
It's great to be in the field with a computer when things go well, but when you're out there alone, then you try your skills as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to players, how to get their best out tomorrow.
You leave behind your partner and he must give them all and show them his best."
Unlike Byron, Jim Furick from the opposing team will ask his players to score better individual performances than those they had with their partners, except for Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas, who won three degrees from the four.
Furik himself has lived through the two ends of the revolutions of the last day, as he belonged to the winning group in Brooklyn before the unexpected turn, as Europe did its miracle.
"I remember every rumor of his word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenso, the head in 1999, had tried his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like at Brooklyn, like at Medina.
When we get this belt, there's a lot of pressure in the middle fights.
We decide our order accordingly and we play with the order that hits us, we'll try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas has taken the lead in the game and is facing Rory Macylroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Foldwood and Ian Polter, the other Europeans in the top half of the series.
"I went with this team with this series because I think it covers the whole path," Bjorn said, justifying his choices for singles.
New Decommissioning for Germany's New Warship
The new German Navy fleet should have been put into service in 2014, in order to replace the old warships of the time of the Cold War, but will not be taken up until at least next year, due to defective systems and the costs incurred, local funds report.
The position in service of Rhineland-Pfalz, the shipyard of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which is called a representative of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Marine War in 2014, but the problems with delivery were crucial for the success of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships ordered by the Marine War in 2007 will replace the oldest Bremen fleets.
They will bring a strong rule, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and ship-guns, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, overcast and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as the use of new brakes will be possible for up to two years outside German ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that even if warships are considered last technology, which will allow Germany to demonstrate its power abroad, until they are finally put into service, they will already be overdue, says Die Zeit.
The bad F125 brake became a front page last year, when the German Naval War officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a ship after delivery.
There has not been much information on the reasons for the return, but the German media reported a series of significant "software and material errors" that would have put the warship in vain if it were used in a war mission.
The software's problems were particularly important. as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have a crew of about 120 sailors, just half compared to the oldest Bremen class brakes.
It was also discovered that the ship has much greater weight, which reduces its performance and restricts the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Pfalz frigate is believed to have the double weight of similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective equipment, the cost of the whole project (including the training of the payer) was also a matter.
It is said that it reached EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion), while the initial budget was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems facing the new brakes are particularly important as Germany's maritime power is being undermined.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy Warship "will soon have no ship for missions".
The officer stated that the problem had grown over time, because the old ships had been wrecked, but there were no other ships to replace them.
It was claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class brakes could join the Marine War.
The National Trust hides the secret life of the nightbirds
A new research carried out on a farm in Scotland's Highlands is trying to discover how nightfallers use the site when hunting their food.
The findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these only-skinned chicks and will contribute to the design of future actions to protect the environment.
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nightlife and the small nightlife, as well as Dobdenton’s coffee and myth in the gardens of Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor nighttime activities throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using hand detectors.
The analysis of the sound of all recordings by experts will verify the frequency of nighttime calls, as well as the types of behaviour.
Then there will be a map of the habitat and a report to form a detailed picture of their behaviour on a local scale.
Rob Duwar, a natural environmental adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are more important to the nightlife and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of management of habitats, such as the creation of pastures and the best way to maintain forests for nightfalls and other relevant species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, the nightlife population has declined significantly since the last century.
They are responsible for the construction and development projects that affect the parts where their habitats rot and are destroyed.
Windshields and lighting are also dangerous, as are adhesive films for flies and some chemical processes of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Nights aren't really blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their fear.
They use an advanced sound detection technique to detect nerves and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 districts of land throughout the country, considers nighttime very important.
He has ten trained experts, who carry out regular research, inspect the parties where nightfalls and sometimes rescue them.
The organisation has also created Scotland's first and only refuge exclusively for nightfalls in Thrave, Damfris and Galoway, where eight of Scotland's ten species live.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the perfect land for the nightfalls.
"Here at Thrave we have an excellent area for nightfalls," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of big trees and an ideal habitat.
There are still many that we do not know about the nightlife, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need to increase their populations."
It emphasises that it is important to have first control over the existence of nightfalls before any maintenance work in homes, as the destruction of one and only small follicles could kill up to 400 women and small ones, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Nights are protected species and we are forbidden to kill them, disturb them or disturb their peace, or destroy their seals.
Elizabeth Ferel, an artist of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer their help.
He said, "There's a lot left to learn about our nightlife and about many of our species we just don't know the evolution of their population."
Ronalto rejects complaints of rape, as his lawyers are preparing to send a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo described complaints of rape against him as "fake news", saying that some "want to self-probate" exploiting his name.
His lawyers are going to report the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The attacker of National Portugal and Youth is accused of raping an American named Catherine Mayorga in the hotel room of Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the complaint, he was brought to pay her $375.000 to buy her silence and not to mention anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on a live video in Instagram at 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronalto, 33, described the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time Gold Ballas winner in the camera.
"They want to self-inflicted and exploit my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and it's all right," the player added smiling.
Ronalto's lawyers are preparing to report Der Spiegel on the claims he published, which they described as "an unacceptable report of reputations that touch private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "ethical damage to the extent of the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of private life in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a nightclub, Ronalto and Majorca returned to the player’s room, where he was brought to violence by nature in accordance with documents submitted to the Regional Court of the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorca claims that Ronalto fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "like guy", but he betrayed the other "one percent".
The documents say that Ronalto admitted that they had sexual contact, but that it was conceivable.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement, because she was "feared the possible opponents" and worried about her "public reconciliation".
The 34-year-old says he's trying to reverse the settlement, as he's still suffering from a metabolic syndrome because of the alleged incident.
Ronalto was willing to receive a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester Yunaited at the time of alleged abuse and this summer he moved to the Italian Youth by securing an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret the loss of cars
The United Kingdom "will regret forever", if it loses its reputation as a world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automotive industry said that the impact of cross-border delays in the Brexit case could cost jobs without agreement.
The factory in Bernston, where the Toyota Auris and Avensis models are being built, supplied almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be discontinued," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's Director at Bernston.
Other automotive industries in the United Kingdom have also expressed fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has declared that it will close Mini's factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems concern risks to the supply chain according to the automotive industries in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line follows just-in-time. Exchanges are every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and the EU for cars manufactured after order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at the borders, resulting in delays and lack of independence according to the industry.
It would have been impossible for Toyota to keep a stock outside one day at her factory in Derbiziir, the company reported, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Teresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "is working specifically to resolve the issue of cross-border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4.
"The information that comes not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that it is necessary to ensure the continuity of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how expensive it would stop production, however, warned that in the long term the additional cost would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Chuvalaris, who has been working in Bernston for 24 years and is United's trade union manager at the factory, said that members of the body are increasingly concerned: "My experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never return.
Government representative said: "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trab's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, White House announces
The important meeting of Donald Trab with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can "extend another week", as the fight for the candidate in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, announced the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Investigator Robper Müller, who investigates Russian intervention in the elections, the Trab's assistants' connections with Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trab would fire the Deputy Attorney General, endangering the independence of Miller, has been feeding Washington's batons for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of setting the stage for recording his talks with the Trab and allowing the president to be removed under Amendment 25.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
Last Monday, however, he moved to the White House through reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trab was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations Organization in New York.
Trab said he would "precisely" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to interfere with the hearing before the Committee on Judicial Affairs of the Authority, which was placed by both Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazai Ford.
On Friday, Trab ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavano, thus delaying the holding of a vote more than the plenary.
Sarah Sanders, a Trab type representative, appeared on Fox News Sunday TV.
I asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been set, perhaps this week, but perhaps another week of data is transferred to all other cases involving the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, but I like to always inform the guy."
Some journalists responded to this claim: Sanders has had to make type information in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of the information was not due to the "printing" movements of television journalists, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they are shown".
He then let it be understood that there will be increased or direct communication between the Trab and the type.
"The President gives more interviews than any previous President," he said, adding without adding any information: "We have looked at these numbers."
They will continue to carry out information, Sanders said, but "if the guy has the opportunity to address questions directly to the President of the United States, it is even better than talking to me.
We are trying to apply it often and you have seen that we are applying it often in the last few weeks and will take the position of the type information where you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trab often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or type interviews with official visitors.
The individual types of interviews are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why this is happening, with a counter-conventional and sometimes strange appearance in front of concentrated journalists.
Minister of Health sends a letter to EU citizens working in Scotland's National Health System through fears about Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU citizens employed in the Scottish National Health System to express their gratitude to the country and to wish them to remain after leaving the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Jean-Fryman, Scottish MP, sent a letter, while there are less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of application for permanent residence ("setled status") for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Ms. Fryman wrote in her letter: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on departure continued and led to expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario of non-agreement.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each official to the extent of nationality.
Fellow Members from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here very long."
Kristion Abercroby undergoes urgent surgery after head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers team's defender, Kristion Abercrobi, was subjected to an urgent surgery following a wound to the head in the Saturday fight, where the Tennessee State Tigers were sent with a score of 31-27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores, as reported by the journalist of the Tennessee newspaper, Mike Orggan.
The chief coach of Tennessee State Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma occurred just before the mid-term.
"He came to the trunk and just broke up there," said Reed.
The gymnasts and the medical staff gave Abercrobi oxygen to the bag and then put him in a van and transferred him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State actor told Chris Harris from the WSMV TV station in Tennessee that Abercroby had left the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "not yet any data on the type/extension of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrobi, a second-year student under a limited participation scheme ("redshirt"), spends his first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
He made five total taclines on Saturday before leaving the game, thus reaching the 18 total taclines for the season.

The measure will be seen as an attempt to eliminate the success of the Jeremy Corbin campaign on attracting young voters with promises of more economic accommodation and on the goal of high wages.
The increase in the amount of paper will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, while the additional amounts will strengthen the government's campaign to combat the lack of shelter.
The increase imposed at the current end of the paper, along with the highest tax rates introduced two years ago for the sale of a second dwelling and rental dwellings, may amount to three per cent.
The Ministry of Economics expects the measure to yield up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London's newly acquired properties are purchased from people who do not live in the United Kingdom, leading to an increase in prices and making it more difficult for first-hand real estate buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many rich regions of the country - especially in the capital - have become "city-soils" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy is being introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the end of the paper, in order for more young people to be able to get their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping the prices of real estate high, but getting land without, however, using it and calling on Mrs. May to abolish the ceiling in economic dwellings in order to restore Britain's "insistence".
Mr Corbin has announced a series of impressive proposed staging reforms, including rental checks and banning exports of "no cause".
He also wants to give greater powers to councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my prime minister to restoring the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
And this means reorganising the dissolved real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
However, it would not be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and companies based abroad to buy homes as easily as hard workers British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of housing property has become too far away and the lack of shelter remains permanent."
Jack Ross: "My absolute ambition is to train Scotland's team."
The leader of Sanderland, Jack Ross, says his "absolute ambition" is to become a coach at some point in Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scotchez is excited with the challenge of raising the team of northeastern England, which is now in third position in the English League One, three degrees below the top.
He moved to the Light Station in the summer, after he had previously referred St. Myren to the Scottish Championship last race season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a call for the second national team, and that was it," Ross told Scotland's BBC on the radio broadcast Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland's team in Hamden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that's something he always pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I have success in training groups."
Among the predecessors of Ross in Sanderland is Dick Advocaat, David Moyas, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gas Poyet, and Paolo Dee Kanio.
The former coach of Aloa Athletics reports that he did not feel guilty when he was called to receive such established names in such a large group, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswick Town.
"At this point, success for me will be measured on the basis of the answer to the question "Can I return this team to Primer Lig?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this group, it certainly belongs to Primer Lig" he said.
"It's not an easy job to get there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross started his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a period as a assistant coach in Dublin and a period of 15 months in the training staff of Harts.
Then he helped Aloa return from the surrender to the third category and led St. Myren from the goal of the surrender to the Championship in the next season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlpool, Folkerk, St. Myren and Hamilton Acantemical.
"It was probably a real crossroad," recalled Aloa's coach.
"I really thought I was more of a coach than a player.
It sounds weird because I was doing well, I was making decent money out of it, and I got pretty high.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to take a lot of time on a weekly basis.
I'm still having trouble with the stress and the pressure of the job, but my coach's job is perfectly suited.
I've always wanted to train and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than I've felt with myself in my adult life."

The best time for beer is 5.30mm on Saturdays, according to research
The hot fuel boosted the profits for Britain’s testing pubs but brought more pressure to the chains of restaurants.
The pubs and bars saw an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the profits of the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, as the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from CGA's consulting company, which collected the data, said: "The continuous sunlight and the largest expected participation of England in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern with the previous month, in June, where Pope's profits increased by 2.8 percent, but restaurants were even more affected.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant revenues in June simply deteriorated in July.
The pubs and bars serving alcohol went far better, with the corresponding figures of the previous years being higher than the corresponding figures of the restaurants fell.
The popes serving food also endured the sunny days, although not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, liquor sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Neuman, from the Department of Respiratory and Hospitality Analysts of RSM, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of the major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors with regard to sales on the outside market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, but the drop in sales by 4.8 per cent on an annual basis will be particularly difficult data from the ongoing cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have appeared at a worse time for businessmen in the concentration area and time would show if the lowest temperatures we experienced in August would give a very long extension."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in trade name launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales index for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants industry collects and analyzes productivity data from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of over 9 million pounds and is the industry's established benchmark.
One out of five children keep secret accounts on social media, hidden from their parents
As research reveals, one out of five children - even 11 years of age - keep secret accounts on social media, hidden from their parents and teachers
Research in 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Insta pages in Instagram
This news instilled fear that sexual content should be included
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
One out of five children - even 11 years of age - create social media accounts that are kept secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta fake accounts - this is a reference to Instagram photo reporting website.
This news instilled fear that sexual content should be included.
Twenty percent of students said they keep a healthy "main" account to show their parents while keeping private accounts at the same time.
A mother who accidentally found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who was forced to rape her.
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the School Directors and Directors' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to keeping secret accounts.
HMC President Mike Buukanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where their parents and their teachers cannot identify them."
Elind Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish Stevie Council
Elind Doyle was elected as a non-executive adviser to the Scottish Steady Council at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning sportsman and President Ian Bity has commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from her wide experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilid enjoys absolute respect for the entire Scottish, British and global community of Stives and we are sure that Stives in Scotland will benefit greatly from its entry to the council," said Betty.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal at 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, has won a total of four gold Olympic medals and is now a regular translator at BBC, remained paralyzed after a transient ischaemic angina brain event.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show if and how much I'm going to take.
It was exhausting, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I do exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Female advertising that compares mothers to cows spreads online public opinion
A women’s production company has published an online public opinion with an advertising that compares mothers who are pregnant with pregnant cows.
In order to launch the so-called "world's first silent and portable telecaster", the consumer technology company Elvie has released a humorous video clip advertisement to show the freedom offered to nursing mothers by the new telecaster.
Four real mothers dance in a herd of cattle full of ashes, with a song that includes sticks such as, "Yes, I like myself, but you don't see any snakes" and "In case you haven't noticed, these are not aunts, they're my tits."
The song goes on to say, "Dear it, cheer it up, baby feed it, cheer it up, cheer it up, my ladies."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has led to online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, as many say it does not take seriously the "frequent" of the milk industry.
"A very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, but their babies steal it a few days after birth" someone commented.
Elvie's gym is discreetly located in a breast support (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else said, "It's obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a theater for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "A completely out of reality advertising."
Others defended the advertisement, while one woman admitted that her song seemed "cardiographic".
"I think it's a very clever idea.
I'd buy a gym like this if I was still teasing.
The call made me feel just like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I didn't get to overstate it.
It's a clever product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who pump mother's milk (commonly in their workplace or in their toilets) and feel like "breaths".
It is not an advertisement that exposes or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women discovers that everyone danced with the discriminating theatres in their yard.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast milk with teapots say they feel like cows.
The Elvie gym, however, is completely inconceivable, has no cables or tubes and is discreetly located within a breast support, allowing women to move, hold their babies and even go out during the study.
Anna Balarin, co-worker and Executive Director of Creation at Mother, commented: "The Elvie Theatre is such a revolutionary product that it was worth a bold and challenging launch.
By making a parallel between breast-feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the challenge of breast milk and all the challenges it entails, at the same time showing in a fun and proportionate way the incredible sense of freedom that the new gym will bring.
It's not the first time Elvie's teastro becomes a protoscele.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the pasarela for the design fashion Marta Jakomboski while using the product.
Hundreds of children of immigrants have moved to rural areas at the border of Texas
The number of migrant children is up, although the monthly border leave remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the administration of the Trab made it more difficult to meet children with guardians.
Traditionally, most conservatives are also immigrants themselves without travel documents and are afraid to come out and ask for a child and thus endanger their ability to stay in the country.
The risk was compounded in June when the federal authorities announced that powerful conservators and other adult members of their household should give fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, filed before Congress that the service had arrested dozens of people who were asked to maintain unmarried minors.
Later, the Service confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had a white criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are either conservators or members of the housekeepers are illegal in the country and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
We therefore continue to search for these people," said Mr Albens.
Aiming to speed up the handling of children's cases, the responsible authorities introduced new rules according to which some of these children should appear before the court within one month of the commencement of their detention and not within 60 days, as they had previously applied, according to refugees.
Many will appear through an icono-televised conference, in the position of the self-representation, in order to develop their claims for the granting of a legal regime before the competent court on immigration matters.
Those who consider that they do not meet the conditions for exemption will be released immediately.
The more children remain in detention, the more likely they are to get stressed or narrowed down, which may lead to violent outbursts or attempts to react, according to refugees and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
The co-workers said that these concerns are intensifying in larger facilities such as Turin, where the indications that a child is difficult to understand are more likely not to be understood because of the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children to the theater without giving enough time to prepare children psychologically or to say good - bye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "holding forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Wailid al-Mulam also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, although the war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism and "will receive appropriate treatment."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he said at the assembly.
Mualem continued that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions of others have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to give this sacred war until we have chased out all the Russian terrorists" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and inform both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Basar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground of the war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions are good for their return and he blamed "certain Western countries" for "disperse of fearless" which drove refugees to stay away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"Politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be granted for the reconstruction of Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a destabilized zone in the last major premier of the Indlib rebels created an opportunity to promote political debates.
The Russian agreement has prevented an extensive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, pointed out that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target giants, including fighters from the Al-Qaida Front Newsra connection, who would "be defeated".
UN Special Envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to the formation of a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the way for elections.
Mualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited to "the revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no intervention should be taken.
Because Trab will win a second term
With this logic, Mr Trab will win the 2020 elections again, unless, as many volunteer observers probably hope, the motion for a bribe and the scandals will soon end his presidency.
Something that would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency of all times!"
So far, there are no signs of audience fatigue.
Since 2014, television numbers in the high-TV area have been overcrowded, reaching 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million in MSNBC.
The Fox News TV network has an average of 2.4 million TVs in the high-TV area, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast, has broken the TV numbers on satellite TV, with 3.5 million TVs in the evenings of important news.
It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Bayer, a producer of ABC's "Designed Survivor" series, where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys the capital.
Nell Scowell, a veteran screenwriter and writer of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
Remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trab.
He asked why?
She said, "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scowell told me.
You can even have fun with chaos.
Of course, unlike what happens to television shows, scenarios coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy v. Wade case, if immigrant families can also re-establish the health of the world economy.
The change in frequency is a luxury that only the most privileged TV viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you go beyond the definition of the informed citizen when you're six hours away from watching a team of experts discuss the use of "a lot of interviews in the audience" by Bob Woodworth for the book "Fear", Paul Manafford's bomber jacket from a $15,000-dollar liner ("a dress full of matter", according to Washington Post), and the consequences of the brilliant descriptions by Stormy Daniels about Mr. Tramb's anatomy.
However, I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"What he does and gives you the feeling of reality show is he gives you something every night," said Brad Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars" television program, about constantly changing actors and the daily distractions at the Trab's show (starts fighting with the N.F.L., blames Kim Young One).
You don't have the luxury of losing an incident, otherwise you stay back.
When I met Mr. Flys this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees of Kelsey outside his house on the north coast of Kaya, but he was closed inside looking at MSNBC as he was magnetizing CNN.
He could not stand, not when Brett Kavano was to appear before the Committee on Judicial Affairs of the House and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging by a stake.
"I remember doing those hot shows before and people were saying, "This will mean the beginning of the end of Western culture," Mr. Flys told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right at last."

External money enters the most limited measurement for the interim elections
It is no surprise that the 17th electoral region of Pennsylvania in Congress receives a flow of money, thanks to the reintroduction of the electoral regions of Congress, which has appointed two active members of Congress candidates for the same position.
This recently redesigned pre-accession region of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who was elected to another region in special elections held last spring.
Lamb has another active representative, Republican Keith Rothfos, who represents the former 12th electoral region of Pennsylvania, which is largely associated with the new 17th electoral region.
The maps were recast following a decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania which in January found that the old regions were handled in an anti-constitutional manner for the benefit of the Republicans.
The re-evaluation in the new 17th electoral region led to a financial competition campaign between the largest financial sections of the parties, the Committee of the Republic of Congress (DCCC) and the Committee of the National Republic of the Congo (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a final victory in a special election census held in March, for the 18th election region of Pennsylvania in Congress, which was followed by a lot of people.
This position was held by Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trab won the region by 20 degrees.
The political analysts give a slight lead to the Democrats.
The United States has examined the possibility of punishing El Salvador for its support in China, but they have turned back.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, causing mild reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trab had a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was holding a hotel in Panama until the partners took over the management team of the Trab Agency.
State Department officials have decided to revoke the US Heads of Diplomatic Missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan any more", said Heather Newert, a service-type representative earlier this month.
However, the imposition of sanctions was examined only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received about US$ 140 million as US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in economic aid and targeted restrictions on visas, would be painful for the Central American country, with high rates of unemployment and death.
As internal meetings developed, North and Central American officials set up a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being, as a result of a corresponding concentration that took place last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the transition of refugees to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top executives made it clear that they wanted to move ahead with the conference, putting a substantial end to the sanctions in El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens is going to address the conference, which has now been programmed for the mid-October, to show the great importance of the administration concentration, as the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned endlessly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House type representative, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultations, subject to anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration, who also spoke under the terms of anonymity.
Read History
The next blow may be the report by the Special Council, Robert Miller, on the deprivation of justice by Mr Trab, for which very strong evidence has now been published.
It is announced that Mr Muller is also turning his research into possible coexistence between Mr Trab's pre-election campaign and Russia regarding the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr Trab will be held accountable before this body, as he is preparing to re-election the presidency in the next elections and perhaps finally before the Court of First Instance.
The 'if' is a lot and I do not assume that Mr Trab's fall, nor his pledges in Europe, is inevitable.
There are options that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the duration of this war.
In 1938 German officials were ready to practice against Hitler, if his West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The ruse of history is turned around by such points of war and the inseparable course of democracy is accelerated or accelerated.
The Americans are now facing enough of these fighting points.
What would we do if Mr. Trab fired Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who held in his hand the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since he wrote in that newspaper that last year he proposed that the president be secretly recorded and that he considered him inappropriate for the president's position.
Mr Rosenstein said that the adoption adopted by the Times was inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the F.B.I. recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanos is not complete or fair or appointed to the Supreme Court in spite of the basic allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections a Congress that will put Mr. Trab's account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in the Act, I don't think we'll fail.

Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna
Raingers welcomes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after the impressive island of Spain with Vigarel earlier this month, will give her many chances of proviso by the 7th Group of Europe League.
A knee injury has prevented Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until the 2-2-score isoplasia with Vigiareal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a tool for greater success.
"It was a good time for us because Vigiareal is a good team," said 31-year-old.
"We got into the game believing that we could achieve something and we got out in one degree.
We might be able to escape at the end, but, in general, equality was a rather fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were a better team in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another great European night.
Well with the facts, we can take three points, but it will be a difficult game because they brought good results in their last game, but, with the world in the open, I am sure that we can put our strengths and bring a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, because of my injuries and changes to the team itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, training is good.
Let's hope that we can do our best now, leave behind the last season and succeed."
Women lose their sleep because of their fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the research participants had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few discussed it with their family.
Nearly half of the participants in the nationwide survey said they were discussing with their wives the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about this to their children.
"People want to take care of their families, but they do not take the initiative to engage in this debate," said Holly Snider, vice-president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Start with that.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will be cared for, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance at purchase price to help you cover these costs or self-security with your own property - enough to have the money.
Draw up your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make yourself aware of health care issues so that you identify a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals will comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, calculate the possibility of making an informed person aware of your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your part and make sure that your accounts are paid, if you become unscrupulous.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Please refer to these details in a written plan so that you can be ready.
"It's not just the economics, but who are the doctors?" Martin was asked.

Andras accepted multiple firearms with a gun in Ilfracob
One man accepted multiple guns with a gun as he walked to his house last night.
The victim, about 40 years of age, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracob in the county of Devon, when he received gunshots in his chest, chest and arm.
The police described the event, which took place at 02:30 a.m., as "a random event".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries he suffered are not a threat to his life, and the police call for witnesses.
Associations and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palos on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With the communications being interrupted, humanitarian aid forces have not been able to obtain information from Dongala, a region in the north of Palus, which is closer to the center of the 7.5-degree earthquake of the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were removed after the destruction.
The following are some important information on Palau and Dongala in the island of Sulawezi:
Palo is the capital of the province of central Sulawezi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawezi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating the 40th of the year when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Dongala is a fortress that extends over 300 kilometers (180 miles) of coastline in the south-west of the island of Sulawezi.
The Province had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture constitute the main support for the economy of the province of central Sulawezi and, in particular, in the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also important in the province, but it meets more in Morouali, on the opposite coast of Sulawezi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Assessment Service.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Chunami also hit West Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is in the Seismic Touch of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the most recent earthquakes and tsunamis are the following:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, while over half were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds of dead in the island of Nya, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake on the Richter scale struck the southern part of Java, the most popular island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: Seismic 7.6 degrees of Richter scale with centre close to the city of Pantang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake on Richter scale struck one of the islands of Mentaway, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and cost of life to about 300 people.
2016: A low-density earthquake struck the Pindi Jaya region in Atsech, causing destruction and panic, as it brought to the world memories of the disaster that triggered the murder earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami was caused this time, but over 100 people were killed by buildings that fell.
2018: Great earthquakes struck the tourist island Lobock in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence
Trac Pelin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the candidate for Vice-President Sara Pelin was arrested for assault.
The 29-year-old Peelin, from Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, prevention of domestic violence and opposition to the principle, according to the report published on Saturday by the police (Alaska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a well-known woman tried to call the police to report the crimes she was committing, she grabbed her phone from her hands.
Peelin is temporarily held at Mat-Su temporary detention facility, with a guarantee of $500, as reported at the KTUU TV station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he said "surely innocent" when asked, as the network says.
Paulin faces charges for three Class A floods, which means he may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to a year and a financial penalty of $250,000.
He is also accused of falling into category A, punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time he's been prosecuted against Pelin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Pelin.
His mother, Sarah Peelin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has already been brought before the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, with preventing complaints of criminal offences of domestic violence and with possession of arms, while in a state of bribery.
His companion claimed to have knocked her on the face.
Sarah Peelin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she joined her son’s violent behavior with a transformative anxiety disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Seismic and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people lost their lives after a earthquake that hit the island of Sulawazi in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake of Richter-scale caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have been shut down, while the number of dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the central Sulawazi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
In social media, video is broadcast from the moment of the disaster.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in Palo when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the Spanishly imposed death penalty for the suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York call for the imposition of a death penalty on Saiful Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack on New York that cost eight lives - a rare punishment imposed on the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, has been using a rented truck from Home Depot to make an attack on a motorway along the West Side motorway in the Netherlands, dragging passengers and riders found on his road on October 31st.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors should prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "on purpose" and caused serious bodily harm "on purpose", in accordance with the declaration of intention to impose the death penalty, which was brought before the Court of Justice of the South Region of New York.
Both of these categories attack the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury brought Saipov to face with the 22-point category, which included eight counts for murder against a criminal organization, a regular practice often applied by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases and a category for violent and destructive automobiles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing the way in which Saipov carried out the attack as "hard, and useless."
"Saifolo Hambimbulaevic Saipov caused harm, harm and loss to Diego's families and friends Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Loor Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Feruchi, Ernan Diego Mentosa and Alejandro Damian Panuko", as mentioned in the statement of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been decades since the last time the Court of Justice of the South Region of New York held a case of death.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but finally he was subjected to a civilisation in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was imposed on a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the spouses Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being sentenced to a concordance for the execution of a spectacle for the Soviet Union two years ago during the Cold War.
Both Rosenberg were performed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, appeared immediately the days and months following the attack, according to legal documents.
He told the interrogators that he felt satisfied with his work, according to the police.
Saipoff told the authorities that he was inspired to end the attack on the ISIS video he saw on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to put the ISIS badge in his hospital room, according to the police.
He declared himself innocent of the 22 categories listed in the category.
David Patton, one of the federal public prosecutors representing Saipov, said they are "evidently disappointed" by the decision of the judiciary.
"We believe that the decision to demand the imposition of a death penalty rather than the acceptance of the declaration of consent for an open trial with no possibility of default will simply extend the wound caused by the events for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the imposition of a death penalty.
Mr Thoris said that Naitzel Faratz should be the head of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Faraz vowed to "mobilize the People's Army" today during the protests at the Thoris conference.
The former head of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians should "feel pressure" by Eurospectors, as one of Teresa May's MPs said he should be the head of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MEP Peter Bowen told protesters in Bermigham that the United Kingdom "would have gone out" so far if Mr Faraz was the responsible Minister for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May is facing in her attempt to reconcile her deep-rooted Members was underlined by the fact that supporters of EU residence in Toris participated in a separate concentration of protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the Chekers compromise plan under control through attacks by Brexit rebels, EU-EU and EU survivors.
The Allies continued to move forward with their efforts to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions and to force Eurospectors and Workers to choose between its package and "gay".
Mr. Bowen said at the Leave Meanings Leave protest meeting that he wanted to fly the Chekers plan.
He said that he should have given Mr Faraz a title of grace and that he should have been given responsibilities for negotiations with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we would've gone now," he said.
The honourable Member from Wellingboro added, "I will support Brexit, but we must cast the Chekers plan."
Expressing opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our laws in our country."
Mr Bowen rejected the allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The assumption that the British people have changed their opinion and wants to stay is completely false."
Brexit's vice-president, Andrea Jenkins, was also in the protest and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chekers plan does not have the acceptance of the general public, the opposition is not going to vote on it, it does not have the acceptance of our party and our activists who are going down the streets and down below elect us.
Please leave the Chekers plan and start listening."
With a strong message to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraz told the protest concentration that politicians should be forced to "feel pressure" if they were prepared to betray the decision taken by the 2016 referendum.
"There is now a question of confidence between us - the people - and the order of our policies," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we won't let you get rid of her if you do."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the order of our politicians, who are ready to betray Brexit, feel pressure.
"We are moving the people's army of this country that won us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the EU's remains were protested in Burma before they were concentrated in the center of the city.
A few activists mentioned the Toris banning Brexit after the group's meeting this weekend.
Lord Adonis's Labour Parliament was silent about the Conservatives on security issues they faced with an application of the party at the start of the meeting.
"It is the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technology necessary for the EU-type agreement – Canada with wealth, for the unspoilt borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute fiasco.
It doesn't mean good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take seriously the possibility of applying for the presidency.
American farmer Elizabeth Warren says he will seriously consider putting the presidency in office after the November elections.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the President of the Democratic Republic of Massachusetts spoke about her future plans during the concentration of Western Massachusetts headquarters on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trab, claims to be re-elected in November, with opposition to the Republican representative of Jeff Dill, who co-chaired the Trab campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is strongly claimed that it can be measured with the Trab in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters making use of the complex's structures since the beginning of the Trab's term.
One representative asked her if she was planning to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for "to go to Washington women to make our dissolved government, which means that a woman must be at the top."
Arrest for the deadly shooting of LSU Sims
The police in Baton Rose of Los Angeles announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the deadly shooting of LSU Wade Sims.
Baton Rose's police department announced the arrest of Diton Simpson, 20 years old, at a type interview at 11pm (Anatolic Zone).
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man who appeared on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot fatally near the University of Southern University early on Friday.
"Wide Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head, which led to his death," police chief Merfi J. Paul said in the media on Saturday, according to the 247 sports web site.
Wade invested to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was investigated and admitted to being found at the point of possession of the gun and confessed to shooting Wade Sims.
Simson was arrested without protesting and detained in the Police Department of the Eastern Baton Rose County.
Three-year-old Sims, who grew up in Baton Rose, played 32 matches, with 10 appearances as a main player in the last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 points per match.
Grand Pri of Russia: Lewis Hamilton goes for a global title, as his team's instructions gave him the victory over Sebastian Fedel
It became clear from the time that Valteri Botas went ahead with Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the fight.
In the backyard, Botas had a good start and almost hung Hamilton, defending his position in the first two turns and calling Fedel to attack his stable.
Fetel went first to the pits and let Hamilton run into the rope, a fact that should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit one round after and went out behind the Fedel, but Hamilton went out after a wheel struggle, which forced the Ferrari driver to unintentionally leave the internal because of the risk of being subjected to the violation of the double movement to defend the third angle.
Max Ferstopen started from his last post and was the seventh in the end of his first round of his 21st birthdays.
Then he remained first for a large part of the race, holding his tracks to finish quickly and pass before Kimi Riconen in fourth place.
He finally went to the Pits in the 44th round, but he couldn't increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, as Riconen came the fourth.
It's a hard day because Walter was fantastic all Saturday and he was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team went great and did the two," Hamilton said.
Body language was very bad
President Donald Trab locked up Mayor Diane Fainstein at a meeting on Saturday for her insistence that she did not break Christine Blassie Ford's letter, in which she accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano for sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony given by Ford before the Committee on Judicial Affairs of the Authority, commenting on the fact that the members of the House proved that the people were "disgusting and foolish and false."
"The only thing that could happen is this beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Authority, where you see anger, you see people who are angry and mean and ugly and ugly and lying," he said.
"When you see publications and leaks and then they call you "oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Fainstein, did you make the leak?
Remember her answer... you interrupted the document - "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't break it."
Well, just a minute.
If we broke in... no, we didn't break in," the mayor added.
Fainstein received a letter from Ford containing details of the charges against Kavanos in July and she went through earlier in September - but Fainstein denied that the leak was made by her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't break her story," Fainstein told the committee, as reported in Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep her secret and I kept her secret as he asked."
But her refusal did not seem to be particularly convincing to the president, who commented during the Sabbath assembly: "I will tell you something, the language of the body was very bad.
She may not have, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, which was accused of three women for sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Republicans use the categories to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power using any necessary means.
You see corruption, sport, they don't care who gets hurt, who needs to step up to take power and control," the president said according to the Mediate news website.
Elite Lig: Dandy Stares 5-3 Belfast Jaids
Patrick Duyer put two bullets for the Jades against Dandy.
Dandy Starks got an excuse for her ride in the Friday game at Elite Lig from Belfast Jaids, winning the 5-3 rebate at Dandy on Saturday.
The Jades took a two-gol ride with Patrick Duyer and Francis Bobiger's juice.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kawney brought the landowners together before Dower returned to Jiand's lead.
Francisco Boussar took care of Danny and then two bullets from Lucas Ludwald Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third time in Elite Lig in the season for Adam Kiff's men, who were coming out with a score of 2-1 on Dandy in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two groups, with the Jians having won the previous three matches.

Air traffic controller loses his life to free hundreds of aircraft from earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared hero, losing his life in his attempt to secure the safe take-off of hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed, and many are ignored because of a great earthquake that hit the island of Sulawezi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong transfers continue to affect the region, and many have been trapped in riots in the city of Palau.
However, although his colleagues refused to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunauan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower that was moving smoothly at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Palou Airport.
It remained in its position to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then in the take-off corridor, could be safely landed.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia’s representative, Yohanes Sirett, said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, as reported by Australia’s ABC News television network.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimadan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before he got to Palus the helicopter.
"We're stuck with his death," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the dead may be thousands, while the country's disaster management service reports that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of dead is believed to be increasing, as many bodies are still under the raids, and many of these we have not managed to achieve," said the service's type representative, Sutopo Purguos Nugroho.
The waves that reached the six measures destroyed the Palace, which will end a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Rizza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a hospital brings bodies.
The clean water is small.
The mini-markets are all over the place."
Jean-Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to save survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
What has happened is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
Indonesia's President Joco Weidonto arrived at Palo on Sunday and said to the country's army: "I ask you to work night and day to complete any work related to the expulsion.
Are you ready?" said the CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lobok, which cost more than 550 people their lives.
Aviation crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after the wreckage of a ship in a lake
The airline flying to a Pacific lake in Micronesia now reports that a man is missing, while earlier it said that the 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini on a type card said that from Saturday afternoon it is not able to find the traces of a man's passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to identify the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats of the region helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as he was trying to land at the island of Chuk airport.
The authorities said Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were staying at the hospital on Saturday and all of them were stable.
The reasons for the conflict and the exact consistency of the events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane was anchored in the sea outside the landing corridor.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was above the take-off corridor.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes said that he and others managed to move through the water that reached them as the middle to the emergency escape exits of the inflated plane.
He said the airfields had panicked and called for the same slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that some sailors working there to improve a submarine also helped rescue by using a floating boat to transport people to the shore before the ship sinking at about 30 metres (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in airline conflicts registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these conflicts.
Analyst presents the schedule of the night in which a woman burned alive
The accused authority completed her purchase on Saturday in the repeat trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014 from Mississippi.
The U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Roulette has spent hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile phone files to serialize the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Cheibers on the night of her death.
Roulette said she received location files from various mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Cheibers on the night of her death, denying his previous claims, as reported in the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with his cell phone, the time he claimed to be with Michael Sanford's friend, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford put up a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the defendant asked him if Telis was telling the truth that he was on the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said, "He was lying, because my truck was in Nasville."
Another contradiction was that Telis said he knew Chebers about two weeks before her death.
Mobile records showed that they only knew one week.
Roulette said that sometime after the death of Cheybers, Telis wrote out his messages, calls and contact details from Cheybers on his phone.
"He wrote her down from his life," Hale said.
Defence is about to begin its purchase on Sunday.
The judge said he valued that later that day the trial would be brought against the jury.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
One hip hop three wants to question the negative view of the species, filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop has escaped from its roots, which were political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make the conscious hip hops popular again.
Artists like the Fugees and the Commons are experiencing a recent recovery in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
And another black?
Danta in New York is texting a couple who fired her after receiving a "racist" message
A New York Date is conducting a couple treatment for racist dismissal after receiving a message from her mother that was mistakenly sent by her last complaint that the Date was "another black man."
The couple refuse to be racist, comparing treatment to "exaggeration".
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when it was realized that the new Jazel Morris was black, just the last one showed up for her first day at work in 2016.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mr. Morris twice.
As soon as she realized her gaff, the poor Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman disbanded Mrs. Morris, saying that their outgoing aunt, who was African American, had done no good work and waited for her position as a Filipino, according to New York Post.
Mrs Morris was paid for her one and only working day and then sent her home with Uber.
Now, Mrs. Morris has taken a stand against the couple asking for compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation for the 350-dollar rate per day for the six-month duration of work as an internal agent, for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he said to the Post Friday, adding, "I know it's a discriminating treatment."
The couple objected to the claim that they were racists, saying it was reasonable to fire Maori, as they feared that they could not trust her again after they attacked her.
"My husband sent her something he didn't want her to send.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had offended, even mistakenly?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now."
Comparing treatment with "exaggeration", Plasco said his husband had just been born two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you hunt someone who's in this situation?
It's not so kind," the bank investor added.
While the legal case is in progress, the Court of Justice of the European Union has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, condemning them for their behaviour and logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not be interested in a bear who speaks, as a new letter reveals.
Bod's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get into the position of someone who was reading it for the first time before his release.
There's a lot of fun when you know what we know now about the tremendous success of Paddington."
He said that her father, who was working as an iconic on BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book from a blue bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "glucopic," as her father left life last year.
Regarding Pandington, who describes him as "a very important member of the family", he added that her father was secretly proud of his subsequent success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't proud," he said.
"But because Pandington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a child who can do something: you're proud of it even if it's not your own.
I think that's how he somehow saw the success of Paddington.
Although it was his own creation and his imagination, he always gave the honors to himself.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her from the phone.
After the incarceration, her daughter was rushed to the Nicaeas Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors tried hard to save her life.
"Nad called all the time and told me it was very bad, that there was not much hope of success," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Sometimes Nand called me to tell me he was gonna die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tasi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be near you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly weakened and came out of her body.
He had already died a few hours before that time and now everything is gone.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream, cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay cold."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who has so far been calm about her daughter's loss, was boarded on the plane with the other passengers who were ignoring the test she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had my head down and they ran tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I was struck by a feeling of compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Women who pass the loss of their own persons hang cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide try to prevent other people from taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphreys hang in a bridge of the Waylia cards with emotional messages and phone numbers that anyone can call to get support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a very promising chef with a traditional smile.
"They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile was lighting up his room."
However, he gave up his job before he died, as "he was in a very bad state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had ended his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm pretty worried there'll be an impact."
Mrs. Davis created the cards to inform the world that there are people out there you can go and talk to, even if they are your friends.
Don't stay quiet - you have to talk."
Mrs. Hamfreis, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old companion, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt trapped or narrowed down or something like that," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we observed a change in his behavior.
He had caught up on Christmas day - when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye."
He said his death caused them a huge injury, but they have to overcome it: "The family dissolves.
It's ruining us.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavano's future is uncertain, as the FBI is starting to investigate.
"I thought that if we could really achieve something like what he was asking - a limited length and limited object research - we might be able to bring some unity," said Mr.Fleke on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be dissolved by fragmented party costs.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Their dissatisfaction is entirely due to the timeframe.
The interim elections are only five weeks away on 6 November and if the Republicans are not doing well, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to win the election of the person they want in the highest court of the country.
George Walker Bus is calling on the Mayors, urging them to support Mr. Kavano, who was working in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife, Asli, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI report is presented?
A vote will be taken in the House, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Republicans.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavano can take at least 50 votes in the House, which would allow Mike Pens, the vice-president, to take the majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees falls under the authority of Kim
The number of displaced persons from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young On came into power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Byeong-seug Park, providing data from the South Korean Ministry of Integration, said 1,127 distances were observed last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China and the highest charges for mobile persons were key factors.
Pionjang hasn't made public comments.
In the overwhelming majority of displaced persons from North Korea, the nationality of South Korea is finally offered.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the borders since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them drift through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected Apostate Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers illegal immigrants as refugees and often exonerates them through violence.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is typically still in war, has improved significantly in recent months.
Early in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pionjang to discuss negotiations on denuclearisation, which have been delayed.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trab and Kim Young Won in Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong Il accused the US of missing progress ever since.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these conditions, in no case will we disarm our country alone first," Mr. Rim said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozy calls Brett Kavano "strange", says he is inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court
The Republican President of the Representatives' Parliament Nancy Pelozy called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano "foreign" and said he was inextricably inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelozy made these comments at a Saturday conference at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman acted this way, she would be called "strange"," Pelozi commented on the Kavan's statement before the Committee on Judicial Affairs of the Senate on Thursday.
Kavano, with a strong urge, refused the charges that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blazay Ford when he was both teenagers.
At his purchase, Kavano was deeply moved, sometimes almost cried, and his voice ran as he spoke about his family and his school years.
He also strongly condemned the Republicans on the committee, characterising the charges against him as "a brutal and coordinated political murder character", which was organised by liberals who have been angry with Hillary Clinton's etiquette at the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelozy said he believed that Kavano's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was pre-deposited against the Republicans.
"I think he has excluded himself with these statements and with the way he managed against Clinton and the Republicans," he said.
Pelozy responded when asked whether he would try to cheat on Kavano if his appointment was confirmed and whether the Republicans obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this - if he does not tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, then he is not only suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court at which he is currently serving," Pelozy said.
Kavano is a judge in the Columbia Regional Court of Appeals (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelozy added that as a Republican, he was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavano regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roy v. Wade case, as a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm his appointment, Kavano failed to answer questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court should be taken.
"Isn't it time to go to court an out-of-court, pre-conceived man and wait for us to say, 'Isn't it great?' said Pelozy.
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a legitimate breakup, months and years of anger are wandering and can't get it out of her without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
She kept saying, "It helped me a lot, a woman who was a nurse somewhere, who said that she was crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique according to which when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it just went on.
And it seemed great to me."
The tears are allowed as a partial burst of anger because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of a job I've done before, in an office where men were ruling, is once I cried out in a louder rage and I was taken from the burden by a bigger woman -- a cold manager I've always feared lightly -- and he dragged me on a ladder.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because you broke it."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Guardian from Colorado, had cooperated with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested for having had an extra-marriage relationship with a ship named Monkey Business (Bromodulia) and left the struggle humiliated, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of putting the same candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he said, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone described the situation as "The Snow and the Seven Brains."
Because the campaign had already begun for a long time, it was back in funding and it was sworn that it would not have entered the election if it had not gathered $2 million.
The battle was lost.
He discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave it only $250.
"Do they think I have a fall?" he asked.
In her speech in which she announced that she would not start an official campaign, she was very strongly charged with feelings - gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than for representatives and anger with sexism - who felt a lot in her neck.
"You'd think I had a nervous cloning" reminds Mrs. Schroeder of the guy's reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleinex was my corporate donor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my graveyard?
"Scream?"
How the trade war between the US and China can do good in Beijing
Greetings of the trade war between the US and China were revealing and while the war has much to finish, a break between the two countries can benefit for the long-term Beijing, experts say.
American President Donald Trab issued the first warning attack earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest climb this week, by imposing new tariffs on US$ 200 million (150 million UK pounds), was essentially taxed on half of all products imported into the US from China.
Beijing returns fires to species every time, while recently it has imposed duties of between five and ten percent on 60 million dollars worth of goods.
China is determined to respond to American fires and the second largest economy in the world is not likely to put it down soon.
In order to succeed in making Washington resign, it would have to comply with their demands, but public promotion in the United States would have been too embarrassing for China's President, Si Jing.
However, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards correctly, American pressures in the context of the trade war could be positive for China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in either of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers in the past," said Abigail Grace, a research partner with a study centre in Asia, at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding the seven-year-old (and now) war of the country.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Wailid al-Mulam said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to replace the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore regularity.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that were forced to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily life and their livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al Mualem said that aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country is welcomed by the Syrian government.
However, it pointed out that it would not accept aid under conditions or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe closes victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018, winning the US team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 in the Le Golf National golf course, outside Paris in France.
The U.S. team has now been deployed 6 consecutive times on European soil and has been winning the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took the lead again, as the Danish leader Thomas Byron's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The star of the U.S. team Phil Michaelston, who fought hard for the longest time of the tournament, threw his shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole, giving victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian gamer of Golf Molinari was missing in all its rounds and so it became 1 of the 4 players that won 5-0-0 since the start of today's tournament in 1979.
US Jordan Spitt was the lowest player in the European team, Dano Thorbyorn Olsen.
The best-ranking player in the world, Dustin Johnson, won 2 and 1 against Ian Puller from England, who can play his last game at Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran eight Kipella Rainder, Sergio Garcia was founded the most winning European of all times in the tournament with total grades 25.5.
"Of course I don't cry, but today I can't hold.
It was a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we took the cup back.
Everything is for the team and I am glad that I was able to help," Garcia said excitedly after the European victory.
It gives the dog to John Ram's companion, who won the American hero of the Gulf Tiger Woods 2+1 in an individual game on Sunday.
"I feel the incredible pride I've won by Tiger Woods, I grew up to admire this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods also lost his four matches in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Tower 13-21-3.
Unusual statistics for one of the biggest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and has only exceeded it by Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding a goal all weekend, except Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
American leader Jim Farick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought.
A few moments this morning we pushed enough into Europe.
We fought hard.
Congratulations on Thomas.
He's a great leader.
And his 12 players played very well.
We will be reorganized, we will work with the US PGA and the Küpellu Rainder Commission and we will move forward.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us."
