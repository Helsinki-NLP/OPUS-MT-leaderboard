The Prague Stock Exchange at the end of the market has had a negative impact.
After the crash in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
The transactions in CEZ actions have reached almost half of the daily trade.
From the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this bottom there's a crack of action on Wall Street.
We also see a reaction from the market to the outcome of the vote by the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the local financial sector's stabilisation plan.
Accrual of actions in Asia
On Tuesday, the actions of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, during the day, later eliminated some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Hang Seng index has eliminated almost 4% during the day, but then also some of the losses stabilised at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, followed by the Chinese Action Movement at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The shares at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but at the end of the loss they saw themselves at 4.3%.
The Thai-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, dropped by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world," noted the head of the Hong Kong Currency Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages its own financial policy, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level in the United States.
US legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should return quickly to the dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise there is the risk that other countries will also suffer the consequences.
Extravagance of American action
On Monday, the US Parliament rejected the financial system's support plan, for which $700 billion (almost 12 billion of the Czech crown) had to be allocated.
The legislators thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
The American actions Monday lived a strike and the main indexes of the actions recorded the largest crash from more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and a drop of such size was last observed in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but once it was seen that the bill had not been approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has surrendered: the US government can spend 700 billion dollars on banks.
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the US financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (almost twelve billion dollars).
But it's not yet said.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, he told the agency Reuters, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening the financial markets.
Subsequently, however, we will have the return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, we will reach market aid.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've taken a great step forward."
"We have clarified our different opinions on the form of presentation of the package for market stabilisation," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The legislators met at night between Saturday and Sunday with the US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final form to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-cedible mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead financial companies to serious losses and endanger the stability of the whole system.
"We are in compliance with the final agreement of the plan that will work and must also be effective on the market".
"It's necessary to bring the recovery plan further forward, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
The Asia Trade Signal
The global financial crisis is strongly affecting the markets for the stocks that are suddenly rolling.
According to the democratic senator of Nevada Harry Reid, legislators are thus trying to reach a final agreement at Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm down investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in turn, the first to influence the Monday market as a result of Congress's decision.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some problems.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount provided for support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has asked.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum if it feels that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the 350th.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may vote on this decision, Congress may vote in favour of its right to vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme has been maintained, i.e. to obtain the funds to buy the passive mortgages, whose price is broken by hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday's and Monday's law," the Republican Senator mentioned.
Progress in the negotiations is also welcomed by American President Bush.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said that Bush is satisfied with the positive progress of Saturday and appreciates "the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold parachutes
The chairman of the bank committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the chief spokesman, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget for reductions, the fragmentation of the financial plan.
The new law also needs to limit so-called "golden parachutes" for the heads of the companies participating in the programme and is establishing a committee to monitor the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have taken a great step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan relates to aid to home owners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new rates of mortgages that it will purchase with the aim of reducing monthly expenditure on the rates for debtors and will allow them to keep their houses.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's why we don't know how and for what price the problem assets will be bought
This will determine how losses will be shared between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz website.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"More importantly, it is that this week the congressional representatives find an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is now more important," Marek stressed.
Last blood duel: MP3 readers against cell phones
We'll recommend how to choose
While almost every cell can read MP3 files, no MP3 reader can call.
This makes it clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons for seeking an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on how to use and the needs of the future owner.
Maybe you could hardly buy a expensive high-quality giraffe to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these music products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view, therefore there is no objective reason.
However, if on your drawers you swallow hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls probably, a giraffe of the same kind at least will dream of it.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8 thousand kroner for a reader, as well as a Pink Floyd fan maybe difficult to digest the tops of the market with twenty kroner crowns.
Two extremes between which there is plenty of space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery duration is to be decided.
Some high-quality music players manage to do much more than simply read music, however, which doesn't even make cell phones wrong.
There is no other current device as universal as the cell phone.
In addition to primary functions, calling and sending text messages, you can read music and video, record both and have a photo machine, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe you can also browse.
And if we take into account smartphones and palm trees you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle because no refrigerator can make the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell also leads to disadvantages.
More functions you use on the cell phone and first the indicator on the screen will require the battery.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cells can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, musical players (especially the simpler ones) are much more effective.
As far as economic cells are concerned, there is no contact that can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, try to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 reader, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a charge.
Another problem exists when you download music into your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of devices have the universal USB port and in addition not all can connect to the computer without a special software.
Surely music can be recorded directly on memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without an adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, with some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music via USB from the computer.
Most cell phones and readers are created by themselves a multimedia library ordered by the names of the interpreters, album name, genre or by the user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both things (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you are especially interested in battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly of ease of use.
If the music is mainly used as a background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you will have enough phone to read any MP3.
This can happen now, clearly to any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about what cell phones or readers recognize.
The MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, the total majority of the devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods).
The best cells also allow, for example, to buy online music.
Just visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic for buying a reader-cell phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited to only hit at the time of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (either through GSM ,internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phone back.
Anyone who wants to listen to some fruit in the bag while the MP3 reader stays forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, if you always carry it behind the drawers or at least earring it without wire.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small part of MP3 players have.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common cupcakes.
The best and technically equipped cells and also with a 3.5 mm take for the common cupboards cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead, the advantage of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) makes it really anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the likeness of handling at a time with the common stereo or perhaps the giraffe, is obviously.
There is no risk of mistakeing the start of the mobile Internet network and as a result of a giant ticket for the transmission of data.
What device to take
Even the cheapest cells (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
Also as regards the purchase of the card concerned, it is entered in 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones make it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you don't have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners you prefer to take the specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service so you get close to the same MP3 reader.
In this area it has made more Sony Ericsson street, which walkman mobiles have the same user scale as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 readers of the above brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4 000 crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in a maximum line up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic since this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
There is something missing – a virtual operator that forces traditional operators to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
The fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive ones in Europe has already been written many times on Mobil.cz.
Finally, ČTU confirmed it, which made it clear that the price of SMS is higher for us than for the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming tariff regulation, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less from abroad than from home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high against Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really like to start the conflict.
Maybe it sounds absurd, and here we have three mobile networks and high coverage above 100%.
On the other hand, mobile telephony operators like to see the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, he often emphasizes also the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, who once expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the traditional operator with its network has no more likely possibilities. (The rest may now be difficult to find other frequencies).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
It was the entry into the virtual operators market that led to a significant price downturn, which would then have had to respond to the traditional operators.
At the same time even before the entry of sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile in the market, they sounded similar voices in Britain as we did in Britain.
However, it has been shown that the place for such operators is there and that they can have really succeeded.
At the end of the accounts for the examples, we must not go too far.
In February this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator has managed to conquer more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group to which in the Czech Republic belongs among the other U:phone.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete Bersaille group.
In order to be able to actually work, many less customers than a traditional operator are sufficient.
They are not behind, i.e. relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
Thus in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer calls and SMS at low price, which is often in balance with the offer of the most restricted services
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS that cost at least half of its competitors.
But as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, it can be a pretty good move also the bet on a small group-breathing.
This operator points to say specifically about men.
"The real men choose Mobilking operator that they like and that you can trust" says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if you can say something like this from us in Poland.
He questioned the press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepýký: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of the services, it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, the mobile network operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there will never be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"It is about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not have many expectations.
Mobilking's focus will be on the other countries in our area," Jana Studničková, the spokesperson for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone dialogue.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this view.
Instead, they try to do everything because there is no competitive potential.
For a while he does not hide his interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And before you do it, it's better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all the Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them," said the spokesperson of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
So maybe there'll be better times.
The non-official information shows that the first virtual operator should have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this point we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no one with a complex and serious project has addressed us," he mentioned in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň of the press section of Telefónika O2.
Other operators also use the specificities of the Czech market.
T-Mobil's press spokesman Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the statement O2: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have had to have a concrete agreement on the table so that we could consider it horizontally."
Vodafone concentrates its attention rather than reaching its 3G licence applications.
Adds Miroslav Čepýký : "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, and this is especially in the context of the sharing of expenditure and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most productive from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
Competent authorities - with complex operators
The attitude of mobile telephone operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to price reductions and thus a decrease in profit.
Why, then, facilitate the emergence of such a competitor?
Ladders around the U:phone creation testify that when operators have something they can take away from the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was pressing towards ČTU during the U:phone creation period towards the T-Mobile company.
This testifies to the public access information from ČTU's website.
But right now U:phone serves as a topic for which you don't accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The environment of the competition of the mobile phone market has been little more powerful than the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another competitor would put on him and, above all, on his alleged high services."
However, the attitude of mobile telephone operators is quite surprising to the complete disinterest of the Czech regulators.
It is not only the attitude of the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - that unfortunately does not have the power to interfere with economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position with regard to the whole issue.
"The virtual operator's entry into the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the necessary infrastructure contract between mobile operator and virtual operator has been reached.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," Kristián Chalupa, of the Section for External Relations, said in response to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not be surprising.
On the other hand, the office that must defend the interests of consumers and also deal with the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market is more than a delicate matter.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside where virtual operators commonly operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services."
Of course, however, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of ÚOHS.
Truly shocking throughout the situation is the almost emotional harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, it is on its own.
Just as the same price of petrol for all petrols is the result of the coincidence and competition struggle.
"The section has not found any signs of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points .
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTU, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has- at the end of the accounts logically – the monopoly of his network.
So for a certain portion, it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for ÚOHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators behave in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, complaints by interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that during the negotiations with all operators, there are very similar obstacles.
Disposal of responsibility in ČTU in telecommunications is a fairly common trick with which ÚOHS is kept out of the way.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been able to promote the expansion of ČTU's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the law on recently approved telecommunications has been updated, despite the fact that many experts were expecting to improve the situation.
This is what the representatives of ÚOHS must know better than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it when no one looks
While there remains the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators, some of which even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their prices lists of mobile telephone services, but they are only partially public.
This is usually about companies that are involved in multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only pre-stable people.
Magic is in fact that the company is compared to the operator as a classic company client, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile telephone operators prohibit a similar forecast.
"If the cases you are talking about, of which we are going to be interested, this could be a breach of the contractual conditions, and could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová answered the question.
But it is quite unlikely that such activity would not reach the ears of the persons responsible for mobile telephone operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there are thousands of customers.
No operator defends itself at the same time from such an attitude.
The activities of these companies bring non-differentiating profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepíký warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
These also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they can not have full of it as usual customers of mobile phone operators "
But this is what should be a little bit weird at ČTU.
Another issue for ÚOHS is also open.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not wish to agree with the explanation of operators who do not have any idea of all this and whose commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be more expensive
As has been said in the text several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small market, too saturated limit, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries in these cases, the defence regulators were involved, not mobile telephone operators, but their clients.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then came to the creation of the first virtual operator and agreed to it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators launch themselves from one to the other all the time like a bollant potato.
For our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity in these cases makes him more comfortable.
But we don't throw the sponge.
If the feedback information is correct and the virtual operator will show up really soon from us, the Czech mobile market will get back on track.
If one of the operators had agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only difficultly ÚOHS could remain indiscriminate to the refusal (discrimination) of the other parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Inno has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech National Inn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Day of Recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn manner the new registrations of the national child "Kde namov mýj".
The new recording of the Inno was made by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – a solo with the male or female voice, a chorus pass and the instrumental edition.
The song is directed by Kateřina Kněžinková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the inno reviews are Otakar Jeremáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful inni.
He has already told the radio "Český rozhalas" that he has chosen specifically to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried to take care that both the choir and the choir have the clear word, that the text is quite understandable, that they are in harmony" he said.
Then the national nest will be celebrated next year on 175th anniversary.
The song "Where domov můj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh theatre in the original opera Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
He bought popularity and people spontaneously made it his own.
The first stanza of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became the natural part of the national Innocent.
E` remains one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" inno sounds
The Prague MDD Wednesday will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when in the metro, tram and bus will be the first passengers who will have an electronic wallet in their pocket instead of the ticket.
At this moment if you can search for about a hundred thousand people who own their Opencard password.
Passengers can buy that from 30 and 90 days and annual (which will come from the first January 2009) and at the same time recharge their own card in the Infopoints and in the offices of the Transport Company and at the stop of the metro Museum, Móstek, Nadraží Holešovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letnyany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Cutlery can already be purchased from yesterday on the internet at the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers benefited from the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the Internet service can completely forget the sports in the metro stops where they had to make long files for paper tickets.
Cutting is purchased online and on Opencard it is charged on one of the 12 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a sport with a personal format that will help interested people in the purchase on the internet and will also register on their paper the credit they bought." said the spokesperson of the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to the libraries you will be able to load the electronic cuttings on the Opencards in ATM and self-services that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they look like ticket forgetters and passengers have already noticed them at the Roztyly Metro stops, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eight," Opatrný concluded.
The cut will be checked instead than by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard key and before you pay the cut, you will be charged above.
The electronic cards are worth tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban trains and bus lines from 300 to 499, the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added to the integrated transport of Prague, there are the controllers equipped with card readers with whom they verify the time and zone validity," explained Filip from the Ropid organisation, which develops the timetables for the collective transport of Prague.
Urban buses have the readers of the cards integrated into the driver’s case.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at a certain point next to the case.
Thus the driver checks the validity of the cutlery loaded.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded cuttings, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take the urban buses and will not remember, when the cut's validity expires, they can go back to the ATM self-service, where the cut's are loaded on the paper.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the display of the device.
The Germans of the Sutes wanted a referendum from the United States
The Germans of the Sutes in 1945 asked to include Shumava in the United States.
This is the result of the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, according to what is said, some German groups of the Sutes addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also the result of the letter preserved in a private archive and today deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American President not to allow the return of the "Shumava district" – occupied by Hitler under the agreement of Monaco –to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and want to be sure of the promises for which American units arrive in German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter signed with the words "The people who hold to the fate of Shumava with all their heart."
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Sudite Germans only hope of brutality, lack of respect, incomprehensibility, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate on Shumava now and forever.
"We cannot believe that without the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you will recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed for nothing, just for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," it writes in the letter.
The reason why the authors can't sign it is the supposed fear of revenge by the " Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had to doubt the Germans' conviction of Shumava , it would be enough in the district to organize a referendum on the will of his inhabitants to become part of the United States or live under the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the history of post-war war, according to some witnesses it adequately describes the expectations of the Germans of the Sudites.
Even though the Czech Germans had to at least perceive that they would have been moved from the republic, only a few of them admitted a very similar possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the people of the South.
Others thought they'd just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp in Holštýn, the dozens of other Czech Germans went to find him to teach him the Czech.
"These believed that once he returned home the Czech would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia during the war, reported that they would have been displaced from the Republic on the basis of Beneš's decrees.
Don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could also be defined as the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to leave on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Rébíček expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour to the steering wheel.
The campaign of 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol on the steering wheel.
And also remind him to put the belt before leaving.
He wants to touch in the consciousness especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not ultimately professional drivers.
What's going to happen in the spots?
Especially stories of people who will affect their emotions.
And this also testifies to the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't think you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written mostly on the label.
And in a pot of blood there's the word "payer."
This should symbolize that a person can pay with his life in a moment of distraction.
The spots will "save" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with dramatic scenes of the victims of accidents can be seen in common.
It is promised to reduce the number of incidents and deaths on the Czech streets.
Spots have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrots and drivers sticks
"With the drivers the karota and baton system works.
The cart for them is for example when they spend time with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or of the accident.
The risk to drivers must be remembered," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the Na Homolce Hospital.
And so they want information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, believe the psychologist.
According to him, the panels that warn the drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel that warns of the danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it," warns Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of the Provisional Israeli Government Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the restoration of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, namely the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the heights of Golan, in exchange for peace between the Palestinians and the Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published on Monday, the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to restore almost all areas (occupied), if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"We have a certain percentage of these territories, but to the Palestinians we should leave the same percentage (of the Israeli zones), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any refund would also include Jerusalem est.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the robbers or spies to pass on to him, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the accent of the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of wounded.
According to the prime minister it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historic places," which are within the Old City. .
"Those who want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also stressed.
The retreat from the heights of Golan
Olmert also spoke for the withdrawal of Israel from the heights of Golan, that is, in his view the indispensable condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians well know what they will have to give up in order to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollahs (Scieti Movement); they will have to give up their permanent support, offering to the terrorism of Hamas, Al-Qaida's (Sciiti Movement) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Questions after the incident: Are stewards illegal on buses?
The law doesn't recognize them, you can't walk on the bus that makes long distance
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Padua of the Student Agency's Pullman came out of the question whether stewards and passengers could move on board the ‘ bus’ during the race.
"If we want to respect the laws strictly and formally, the work of the steward is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The incident of last week with which he lost his life a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut the road to the pullman.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver on the less secure seat of the Pullman, although there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can make an incident or suddenly slow down even when the coffee or newspapers are distributed.
Depends on whether the bus is equipped with or less seats on foot according to the traffic guide.
If it is not approved, passengers must be seated.
The buses of the Student Agency did not stand, he confirmed the director of Radim Jancúra at Aktuáln.cz website.
"We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned place," he said.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The law of road traffic recognizes only the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," says Hanzelka spokesperson.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorny believes that the law is sufficient to address this issue.
Depends on whether the bus has the approved seats.
It's all here," he says.
It categorizes buses in cities where there are pedestrians and the maximum speed limit, interurbans with pedestrians with higher and longer traffic speed without pedestrians with the maximum allowed speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in a plane, the expert says.
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Horín does not find the underlying problem in the driver's movement on the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the air service.
It's not even safe there when a turbulence arrives and the flight assistant can blow his head off."
"If the bus makes a braked rush, of course, the laws of physics are valid.
Just like in the city bus or on the tram.
The carrier undertaking must solve the safety of the stewards by means of an internal regulation," he says and also intends that, from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Jančura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers steward services..
This uses about two hundred.
The director does not even consider their business dangerous after the incident.
"As soon as I have the feeling of having to consider the steward's profession as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they leave.
They would also reduce expenditure," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a section of lines compared to the Student Agency, has motivated the absence of stewards on its means as an interest in security.
"We don't have hostess, we've been opposed since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal incident," said less than a year before Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has occurred.
In the incident of the line for Naples a young hostess of the region of Plzeň died, which he had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency course without using the arrow and blocked the road to the pullman.
The driver of the pullman tried to avoid it with a sudden maneuver, but he pushed it with the front right.
Jančura rejects the fact that they had been occupied by the two reserved places at the rest of the Stewarts.
"It's not possible to reserve these positions in long-term buses, they're inseparable."
The company intends to report the truck driver.
The Agency will not wait for the Court’s judgment to pay the damage to the girl’s family, but a financial compensation is expected from the offender.
The revision of the law?
Not visible
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than one year, could lead to specifying the Stewart movement on board buses.
"However, they have not achieved any concrete results.
They are not considered so much by the Pullmans, they deal more with the score system, maximum speed on the ‘autoway and use of the cell phone during the drive’, says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of Stewart as a major threat to passenger safety," concludes the spokesperson Havelka, who controls bus safety is the responsibility of the police and the security offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes point to Frankfurt
There are no missing words in the letter from the director of WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the centre of the capital market of the financial group of savings funds" through the meeting of the Düsseldorf bank's unit with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
West LB would launch "a competent block" with sustainable profits in such a company.
In addition, such a union could be a decisive push for further links in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is how it is read when a difficult time management board wants to demonstrate its ability to act.
Because WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, but also by the North Rhine-Westphalia regional government that time is narrowing the search for a future solution.
About the links between the Deca-Bank, which the same customers of the Savings Fund because of their investment funds already know, and WestLB is certainly talking about it for a while, also by Frankfurt.
At the end of August, he referred to the head of the Deca-Bank Franz Waas at the time of the presentation of the invoice of the first half of the year that a merger of the house by via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the Deca's Board of Directors, which is taken half by regional banks and savings banks, has delegated the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with West LB on joint contracts.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
But the conversations have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
The Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most in the business square in Frankfurt, not the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings sector.
In 2003 for a short time it seemed that the Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate and Helaba.
This association to three has nothing to do with it.
As soon as the projects were published, the Asian regional bank was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate went to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stockholm.
Yet they have always thought about us for a merger of the Deca-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end Günther Merl , President of the Helaba Steering Board, expressed himself against design games to meet with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that cognition is being created, that it is necessary to bring the different houses of the public sector closer together.
Since the Bavarian Parliament was elected, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank could first take place with that of the Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba it's not really good news.
If the pressure for other mergers is increased, the partners will be left missing.
In the south, there would now be the junior partner, although so far the financial crisis has been much better than the houses in Monaco and Stockholm.
The Association of Asia-Turingia Savings Boxes, which participates with 85% of Helaba, has put the chain to the meeting with WestLB.
Only NorthLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how to combat the different business models of individual houses.
In June Merl noted that the decisive question, with which business model the future of the regional banks would be assured, would not yet be answered by the association of German savings funds.
In the end, the division of the West LB could also come out, which naturally does not want.
So the letter of the Board of Directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the individual parties will work together with the Deka-Bank.
THE second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it's the first time while for Luca it's the third or the fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a partner, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them is a barge of 5l. Kaiser brand standing and shows about 200 travellers what are the deep tones that can be produced from the throat.
Elena before Luca a package and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, they leave tonight at 23.45 four runners with destination Monaco, Festa della Beera" , expected to arrive at 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved especially for Italians, on another trip only Brazilians.
In a parking corner the South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so noisy, says Marco, that it's not something for Italians.
A frame that wears a long cap with a fake leather case and a couple of glasses with the wide silver stickers belong to it.
For 5 years they've been going to the Oktoberfest, this year they're 3 tours.
The day after night, day after day, return at 10:30 p.m.
Nighting would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the Bavarian rules of authenticity, the case of illness and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses go around the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
The silence on the bus falls. Travelers sleep.
Better this way, they'll still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with an Italian mark on the A9 motorway before Monaco take a short break.
When, as expected, the Marco group arrives at 6.30 p.m. in the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others group together, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First: put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the beer tendon doors open, it means running!", quoted Mark in the morning.
"Run!" Run and take the positions at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, but we lock up, and not all the yellow quarrels sitting on the same benches, split into the right space!"
The mouthpiece costs 8.25 Euros.
And don't forget to give up.
"Provide to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they'll be gone!"
Third: "We'll meet again at 22,30 points here!
It's already off for the party.
On the street an attack like following the yellow berths to the trees, to the road signs and even to an advertising banner of a large Bavarian popular party.
He wants to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as "the Italian weekend".
Exact data do not exist, it is 50 thousand, which go through the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of the visitors come from Italy.
The Monaco police are strengthened with 7 agents of the High Adige, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where Italians are the first with 200 medical care in front of English (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Mostly beloved by the Italians is the trend of the Hofbrühaus.
1. Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed by Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the policy has used the word "relative" and has also pointed out that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis is starting at the weekend.
The real-estate financier Hippo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday, support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay interest for the requested party.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
Deep down are the losses of the Deffa affiliate.
According to a newspaper article, the state financier refinanced itself in the short term – which is no longer possible due to the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves fell from 95% of the EUR 2.37 million, even the equity share dropped from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net return on financial affairs fell to 0 compared with last year, the benefits of increases in both demand and certain actions as well as the liquidation of credit balances fell by more than 70% over the EUR 5 million.
Only through higher incomes from the reimbursement of subordinated compensation costs, both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the repayment of interest under the single text of the tax laws and from the management of business for business consortia, has the negative profit been sufficiently moderate with about 16%.
The former public financier after being privatised in 1990 lost himself in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were cut off in the Aareal Bank.
As income in classical state funding was too low, the Depfa has become more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects by private and state investors (PPPs) and has been diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate now has to amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the profit and loss account of the group.
The fact is that dividends have been cancelled.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of the Deffa is an important contributor to the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market between banks compared to other institutions because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of loans between banks in large part has been dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a part of the Deffa credit portfolio – around 50 billion – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financial requirement was covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of the international monetary markets for the most non-functional.
Other sources suggest that, thanks to the money, refinancing is ensured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE Georg Funke Steering Committee said otherwise that the HRE group will not need monetary markets in the short term.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the commerciality of the HRE group is still ensured.
This is expected for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and the importance of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
Financing may not be used entirely.
But the opposite is not to be excluded.
After Sunday evening the bank learned what it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The share price falls from 75% to 3.30 Euros.
The exchange rates are pretty good.
While the previous grade debts are almost irrevocable, the courses of deferred credits are given.
In particular, the loans of the Württemberg-Hypo affiliate are affected, with a maturity of more than 2009.
Before the HRE loans seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, their value must now, after the strengthening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which, with the emphasis of the Deffa, the crisis has come to an end, be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Until the most damaged central banks, governments and banks are still ready, you can count on a depreciation of the annuality by the end of the year.
Or it will come into operation, what no one is looking forward to – that the financial crisis will be overrun in the next 15 months.
But with regard to the information seized due to partial states, the probability has become almost certain of a legitimate hope.
In particular, it will create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision to split up from their commitments.
In the short term, investors may conclude the reporting of losses for future payments of the countervailing duty on surpluses.
Sylvana and the Secrets of Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of school should appear at the Tachibana High School, the girls begin to laugh: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does it mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Japanese story exchange log.
The first day of school in Japan
Like I was excited.
I also had the courage to go to school.
I dress on the coast of Tokyo to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to the Tachibana High School.
The road had to be found by myself, and fortunately I didn't lose.
The beginning of the first class does not seem to have been fixed as we did in Lower Saxony.
The schoolchildren arrive from the 8th floor later, until at 8.40 a.m. they begin a short conversation with the teacher, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I am not the type who speaks voluntarily in front of people, in front of a class of 40 students
Since I had not yet had my school uniform, I put on an old mother's dress, along with a shirt, blue pants and black leather shoes.
That's how I put myself in front of the cathedral and tried to say well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate my birthday in a week.
At the time, I was very happy that I had already begun to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class were bickering, trimming and making signs, and I continued to hear the word "Kawaii".
I've known her since my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lesson of Japanese girls to survive and it means "sweet, sweet".
Then I ran fast to my place.
The girl next to me was embarrassed. It was an honor for her to sit next to an exchange student.
The rest of the lesson was continued quietly, but when he played the gang, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
Everything was disoriented and they would pick me up and dry me up with questions – then it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me the lunch basket-- it's different from the boring German pancakes.
I had risted with spices, salsicins, celery and algae, fruit and a kind of wrap with meat and tofu..
To say the truth, I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new taste.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under the hall, brr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Bento made by herself, prepared quite artisticly, with the hope of making the boy know during the recreation.
I read it in my Manga comic book.
I'm really curious if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said,
"Because it fascinates me"
Finally, I've been reading with fervor and Mangas for years.
And to better understand the comics and culture that contain, before or after I started to learn a little Japanese.
I was absolutely convinced that I would come to us once.
I am also fascinated by traditions, customs and customs.
There's a lot of them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends - from the opposite side: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
1. Even rats have feelings
A rat or a turtle flee when they feel the danger. Does that mean they also feel the fear?
The neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how can we find out if, when they behave in our same way, they have our own feelings?
Articles of well-known scientists have been published on the Internet newspaper "Edge" for some years.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents the chosen answers to the question: "What do you think it is true, without being able to try it?"
I think animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it, since we can't even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we address other species and ask questions about feeling or generally about consciousness, we enter an impracticable territory, because the reference base does not fight.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do. It pretends to be dead, run away or attack.
People behave similarly, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the side frontal cortex is often linked to human awareness, the associated circuits (this for its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this vast area is much more developed than in other primitives and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation on the assumption that man is even different from the other primitives is thus admitted.
Another dramatic feature should be presented in the way of speaking about man: since a large part of life is connected to the language, it is often said to be connected to the conscience.
In this case animals could be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of the animal, as it is done, certainly differ greatly from the circumstances of our conscience.
That is why it is difficult to discover how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through its experience because of the special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but besides this there is another aspect of consciousness to which it would be easier for science to have access.
The processes of animal consciousness could be analysed without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happens in the studies on the short memory of the primitives, particularly in the example of visualization.
So because of this principle, which Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, it goes first to the neural correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: they could both be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the frontal cortex for the implementation of the display.
So what is it designed for feelings?
I blame them for the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the body's reactions) takes on the memory of work.
In this way, the feelings are closely linked to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primitives and, in particular, the human being.
With the talking nature we create subtle shades of feeling, because we can distinguish and categorize situations with the help of words and grammar, to describe them to others.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings are more primitive in the regions of the body of the sensations of the cortex and of the headache, similar to Jack Panksseep, which has focused more on the palaeocefal.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could certainly be part of the extended feelings of the species.
At a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it to be inextricable.
Pankseep brings up arguments on the fact that what appears to rats and human beings as fear is likely to be so with the sense in both cases: but how could it happen if rats and human beings prove the same when they behave in a similar way?
Is there any danger that he would run away as if he too felt the fear?
In my eyes, the mere similarity of behavior cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
And that is, the neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and human beings have similar paleoencephalus, not even a brain.
But is paleoencephalo responsible for the feelings?
And even if you could prove it for human beings: how would you like to prove it to the rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress at the neural level, in agreement that you give up the same procedure on rats and men.
As I don't research language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This can be considered myopic, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than constantly kicking against a wall.
I'm a practical emotional for the occasion.
President of UEFA Platinum: referral to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries"
Both countries of masters of houses are in the march table for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports.
The number of stages to be set for Europeans will eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work at the highest speed," said the president of the Ukrainian Association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
Following numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN association was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that PZPN will not be able to operate in accordance with the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP Information Agency.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparations for the 2012 EM will not suffer."
Many exhibitors of the first division were condemned only in the last season for manipulation, and at the end it was also necessary to refer the beginning of the League to the last moment.
Dennis Quaid rebate angry
He wanted to promote a new film, he talked about the private and now he's got a big deal with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan said he was an adult.
He snooped out of anger.
War of the Roses is delayed by the former married couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now arguing with each other about a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week expressed himself for the first time on the grounds of marriage failure: "Dennis was very unfaithful to me, and this was very painful."
The scope of the betrayals you would have come to know only after separation.
The opportunity for the "scarlet of the soul" was the work with Ryan's print for his new film "The Women" – the story of an adult.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared an adult husband was clear: it would be "unheard", he said on the fiftieth anniversary of "New York Daily News", which "Meg for the next time repeats and reworks the story of our report".
It would also be "deplorable" that in Jack , the sedentary son who had together, again "are publicly remembered the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan lives alone, Quaid is remarried and will soon become a father of twins.
And so his judgments close with the arrow: "My life in any case goes ahead.
I think I'm lucky to have a wonderful family where everything is for the best."
Low prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and overnight stays in the hotel have become more convenient - this is the result of a study by the financial provider and American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, observed a clear decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places are already priced.
From January to March, prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities still under review on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
From April to June, however, prices were already at 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay up to 37% less than a year ago.
American Express sees as the reason for this weak dollar quote, which would have led to a "hot desire to travel of American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession of hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
As regards the prices of flights, the trend in the first quarter still indicates:
Because of the Cherosene reincarnation, the Economic Class passengers had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range fuel flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, the prices of the Economy Class air tickets fell on average 12,5 % compared to the previous quarter, in the first class and in business, however, the price changes were much weaker.
In Germany prices are even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9 %, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 %.
With regard to domestic German flights according to the study, prices have even been moderated.
The reason for price fluctuation would be economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has collapsed.
On the other hand, there would be through the open-air agreement, which liberalises air traffic between Usa and Europe, an increased pressure on competition.
The sign of the critical situation would be the elimination of non-profit routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared failure – only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a simple goal and methods, Hamburg's SV becomes a capolist.
In Borussia Luhukay is not yet able to find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein makes the landing of luck worse for the national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first got into the game late and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was accurately formulated, passed on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the Hamburg arena.
It didn't happen in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of them were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for nearly 3 decades of HSV, enjoying an even greater estimate of some old players.
And so his monk also found listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol announced and raised the thumb as a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the coach head of the Amburgo Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here's the second goal!
The change in location did not occur.
"Today wasn't all good to see," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have become "more relaxed".
For the 1st to zero, those in Hamburg must thank the blow of the head of Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that many weak players in Gladbach couldn't hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
The Hamburg SV this Monday will be 121 years old.
The spectators already celebrated before, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the shining class on the video screen, which legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We are able to put everything in place," said Marcel Jansen.
It has the presentation that the provisional table certificate is more indicative of the predictability of the sample than of its HSV domination.
The team with its new arrivals engaged late – the Brazilian Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric gate as well as Jansen blown to the FC Bayern – finds himself slowly, but is not yet able to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," Jol said.
After the defeat of the vote
Wall Street is surrounded by fear.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package has temporarily collapsed the Dow Jones of 700 points.
This was the greatest loss of points in the space of a day of his history.
Later down again.
About 20:30 the most important world stock exchange barometer has scored/recorded with a good 5% in cash on 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was firm with a deficit of more than 7% on 1548 points
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, it just gave us 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could have done it.
The Goldman Sachs Bank's shares dropped by just 10%.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffet had taken part in the company.
In the context of the rescue plan, the financial funds for the collection of so-called mortgage documents had to be allocated
The amount must be paid, however, not in one stroke, but in degrees.
By re-establishing the State, it had to maintain the stock option certificates of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with an appropriate quota procedure, in order to reduce the State's debt.
The course of action in Europe and in the USA in the bottom line
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and in the USA do not eliminate investors' doubts.
The course of the actions of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate falls to the peak and draws the index of the German stock exchange to the bottom
The American Dow Jones index leaves us in spite of the planned salvation of the financial market through the state.
Spectacular loss of the course of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank have drawn the index of the German stock exchange in deep deficit.
Despite the rescue of the federal government and private banks temporarily 3 quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank has surrendered more than 20%.
The German DEX bag index is clearly skimmed under the psychologically important 6000 points and is quoted with a deficit of 3.7% of 5,839 points.
World stock markets are falling on their knees.
New York Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
The investors feared that the 700 billion-dollar rescue package of the US government could not be enough to bring the financial markets back to growth.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first business hour or 3.3% out of 10,809,25 points.
The House of American Members wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the vote in the Senate could follow on the first of October.
The other European exchanges also managed only one direction: in London for the time being the FTSE index dropped by 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9%.

The dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: the dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the pipelines of the fuel that freeze quickly, it is now up to you to die for freezing.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the anomaly of Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes, with which they obtain additional spear/spin/spin/scillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical specimen as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What surprises scholars for years: the races do not behave at all as they would expect under the law on gravity.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year resumed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curve of space, might not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study strongly believes as before Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain Swing-by's anomaly through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have seen in the cosmos.
"Responsible of the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Of the existence of the dark matter, space scholars have only known for about 10 years.
There is, of course, a force of attraction from her, whose effect on the other heavenly bodies is seen.
It itself is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, the dark matter is at least one fifth of the total mass of the cosmos.
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the release 6 kidnappers were killed.
In the south of Egypt, 5 Germans were kidnapped.
The rescue negotiations are already under way.
Germans are always in the sight of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was consistent with the Egyptian state television, the Arab Al-Arabian broadcaster and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the chronaca of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released
We are examining their health status," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of a shipment in the desert are already on the way to Cairo.
There is still little clear evidence of the backdrop of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released. Therefore, the kidnappers would have been ready after the signs of an Egyptian public security officer to conclude the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army had killed 6 of them by surprise.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It would have been "only agreed to take over the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had killed by firearms 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers claimed from Germany a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German intermediary, the release of hostages would have been delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, kidnappers wanted to release women after the ransom was paid.
The men would have to remain detained until the kidnappers had had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the relationship .
Father's abuses "carried to suicide"
Years of abuse by the father brought a woman to kill herself, he declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, of Stythians, Cornovaglia, was in prison for 6 years after he admitted eight cases of sexual assault.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his daughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a note of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had been killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Treise harassed her and beat her before having sex while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to Cornoglia.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering on the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, the Public Minister Ramsey Quaife told the court that Mrs. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and who had "smoothed with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
You think you've killed yourself by suffocating yourself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's father, who wrote a letter of confession that ended up saying, "The lay and blessed her."
"I didn't bother you sexually.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treise: "He is an extremely strange fetishist, and for his victim he must have been terrifying, especially when he was only seven years old.
"This sad saga ends with the victim who takes away his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to be ended before the court."
I know the effects that Stephanie's father and mother have had on their daughter these years.
" Otherwise it was clearly likely that she was a promising and happy young man of success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Office's official who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be accused by the Official Secrets Act, has learned from the BBC.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defence when he left on the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is the least delicate of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal attempt.
The BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They would have thought this was treated internally at Mod and at the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is to be charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be accused by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The missing documents contained assessments on al-Qaaeda and Iraq's security forces' capabilities.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of more than £800,000 after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has given 14 billion sterlings to protect Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million savings deposits.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take the savings money, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "irritable" that companies and their members have to pay.
The 14 billion sterling loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans will be redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid annually to 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged annually to 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is annoying that those institutions that have behaved cautiously... are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to 450 million sterlings in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million sterlings to pay for the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the construction company association, told the BBC that he believed it was unfair.
"It is annoying that those institutions that have behaved cautiously on the market in the resumption of houses are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see which options are there to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account," Mr Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The milk salt at 5 pennies per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in the wholesale prices of her milk for an extra five pennies per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two Pennys in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increase in February, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Refuses bail to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when you return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him a guarantee for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) to a businessman when he was a member of Parliament.
The case is one of the many charges of corruption against us.
The long-standing political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh by Sheikh Hasina is scheduled for the next few weeks but his party, Awami League, asked that the country's temporary government supported by the military give the full freedom first.
The correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical care on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of her release, if she can remain free when she comes back to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The High Court has rejected the application for bail for Sheikh Hasina by saying that she cannot have the bail since she is already abroad on the word for medical care," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall bring an appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs security to return to the country from abroad to prepare the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina's return is expected after October 17th, said a senior leader of the Awami League party on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the government attached to the military took power, but she was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear of Afghan anti-pollution campaigns
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The United Nations has launched a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that he cannot reach the children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A spokesman for the United Nations said that this happened despite the Taliban's promises that they would not attack or impede thousands of people from the staff who carried the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to oblige the company to reduce its participation in the rival ITV television station.
BSkyB was told by the court of appeal of the competition to cut its actions on ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Earlier, the Commission had said that BSkyB’s participation hindered competition and allowed for an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's participation in ITV raises doubts about ITV's independence, thus making the Competition Commission launch an investigation.
The chief of the Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stack was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surprise its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the U.S. Attorney
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special Ministry of Public Affairs to examine the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation shall take place when a report on the case is made by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice critical of the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical to the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was sparked by the fear that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
The Special Public Ministry Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
"Serious accusations of potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or discovered," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said lawyers had been fired for late performance.
But later it turned out that the licensed lawyers had not been assessed more late than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal was motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the judicial action against members of the high profile Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and bring cases to the court on behalf of the government.
They may be fired at any time, but they may not be released for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was in the desertification storm, and finally he outlined his position.
A number of other officials from the Justice Department were fired.
(The Commissioner-General's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales's role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in the discharges, which he had devoted to his role as leader and had been extremely dissipated during the process.
Other officials, including Bush Karl Rove's former senior assistant, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
The Epica of the Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for his inno Epico Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to gain recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 album hit track.
Coldplays will run the nominations for this year's awards, being on the list of nominations in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that go beyond things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, demanded a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opens with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was performed as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached the 15th place.
But Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell's album remained in class for almost nine years and sold more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heart beat in 2003 after crashing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
It came later that he had a cyst on a vocal string.
Dark streets of the city, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crossings, some famous ones, others just used.
But also many veterans and residents for a long time find it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, especially because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without making the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active road traffic.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal Atlante.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include close to long ones who say they were hit by the sledged road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the noble neighborhood of the past.
But the city's conservation and development department, which has road control, is not interested in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Land Use Committee of the County Committee of the Environment, some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay have outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy roads.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the city's hands, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the head of the Community Board 3 District.
"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There could be proposals to regulate and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that he wanted to reopen the small street and install seats, including some to be used for a coffee where the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this abandoned village and turn it into a public Amenities," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Preservation Accommodation, said that it was in fact the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its most colorful neighborhood, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slightly historical print.
Some believe that he took the name in 1802 when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many sons and the narrow stretch of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps better known as the cover photo set of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia."
"The ground was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was the top of immunization, scarves of clothes and pieces of boots, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about "gentrification" in the East Village, objected to the idea of selling Extra Place, bringing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a city fragment almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Tears: A bit nostalgic look at the city in the process of extinction"), published part of a talk on the history of the city that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow life without exit, dark also of day and limited storage doors in rustic iron and windows with saracinese, with old newspapers of weeks traveling along the bassifon."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran through the back of the road near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
There were graffiti on the walls and a bottle of empty beer from 22 ounces of barley near a group of abandoned newspapers.
Few passersby said that they rarely thought about Extra Place but suggested that they would need to be a bit adorable.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks that some people underestimate the attraction of the road in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty and disgusting places."
Bilingual debate: divestment in English
In this point of Educational Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California's studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
To really attract Spanish voters is a complicated matter.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "African and Latin students have significantly less probability of graduating than white students," which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transition bilingual education" for English students.
However, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in language classes other than English, does not take into account his interest in filling learning differences.
Let's take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the eastern Los Angeles county.
School students are for the Spanish and low-income majority.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among the fourth students, a surprising 100 percent of the students did the upper level test in the 2008 maths exam.
A equally surprising 93% of fourth grade students did the expert level test on English-language art.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient from that preferred by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an attitude of "no excuse".
Moreover, and it is here that Mr Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, of the school's obstructive approach for English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "We had a fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico and if you had entered class 12 months after you could not figure out what it was."
"It works," he remarked, "for us it works."
Would Obama take a school as a Sixth Street Prep model to replicate it in other Spanish majority schools and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its continued support for bilingual education prevents Mr Obama from predicting the answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently flagged the issue when he said people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps of achievement, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than ignore them or banish them.
Oil suddenly collapses and renews economic fear
Oil prices have fallen sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The futures of the grain fell from 7 percent to $99.80 to the stock market in New York in the morning.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the raw materials markets have been driven by Wall Street's financial turmoil, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 to the barrel in June, prices were dropped to almost $90 to the barrel at the beginning of this month, before highlighting again, on the background of a tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
The anxiety influenced investors again Monday even after the congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement at the end of the week on the rescue plan, the biggest of history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from past.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will purchase the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that the frequent weekend negotiations had led to a rescue agreement " seemed to have failed to revitalize the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation worsens, we expect the demand for raw materials, including oil, to calm down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape from the contagion.
From a perspective of raw materials our most urgent concern is to the extent that the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year while household oil consumption due to slowdown in economic growth, reducing forecast prices for oil and gas by around 20 per cent for 2009.
The operation in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, advocate Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he looked at it taking place on Sunday's second quarter, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a climb.
"Never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had leveled the grey of the menacing clouds over them with a fiasco game.
Then the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranus Coles for a 12-year-old touchdown, providing the perfect signal for a afternoon in which their growing syntax made a huge move forward.
Favre has found Coles for two other touchdowns in the room, including one when one cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't get out of my path," said Favre of all the passage to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were playing capture games, the defense severely hit the quarterback of Cardinals Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a waving launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith has scheduled another passage and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fumble.
The last tournament, the fumble forced by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took advantage of that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets took the ball again with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely jumped a target of 20 yards, for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets have ever marked in a room.
When asked to describe his madness, the coach of the Jets Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When both were told - the Jets gave 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second fourth much more than the third."
There have been a lot of points in a little bit of time."
Gebrselasia resting above its record of the world
Hail Gebrselasia of Ethiopia has shown again why many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking its same record of the world at the Berlin marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to run a race of 26.2 miles under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the course in favour of plan at 2:03:59, Gebrselasia sends in frantums for 27 seconds his previous score at 2:03:26 last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie develops the 26th record of the world of such a daring career that it has produced a world championship or a record of the world at every distance from the metro mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselasia jumped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps in too alarming, in retrospect - that air pollution would have worsened its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselasia won Sunday with an average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-founders like Gebrselasia and Paul Tergat of Kenya went to long distances, the marathon record fell more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago she had her eyelids at the pollacks and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I am so happy," Gebrselasia told reporters.
"It was all perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but at last everything went well."
It was a bit criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for having excessively orchestrated its races, usually avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, counting on apripist as if it were a mid-end race, and putting the world's records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the size of Gebrselasia's skills as a marathon.
With the step taken by four Kenyans Sunday, Gebrselasia reached the halfway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, kept in competition Gebrselasia after the apposts disappeared.
Just over three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made a final effort to separate from Kwambai, who ended up at 2:05:36, improving her best personal time of almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, the native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She lost the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad incident, but she was cured to win Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she has run.
She ran a race doing well with the calculations, leaving a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to go with a great distance, taking it back after about 18 miles and a half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extensive theme park on Orlando’s suburbs, a few miles from the splendor, from the noise, from the enormous, lies the quiet city where pride and complications of African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black city embedded in the country and the home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown Skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, Harlem Renaissance's most famous writer.
Yet in many ways, the city that has described - and that stops tourists including it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Depression era Federal Writers' Project - remains a place apart.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little about us, doesn't know what's going on."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain different from the look of the outsider.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, a resident from all over life and a member of the oldest church in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville was long defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power taking as well as a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary centre but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of the blacks of the south - sometimes decrepit, sometimes prized - born from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both fair and protective.
And the concern about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, who everybody here is called Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere books, rich in dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes We Are Watching God" (1937).
Five sections of Florida's guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten centre of Florida into a scenario of black history and human drama
Low as a grancass both in life and in literature, Hurston took the readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then turned into more private areas.
"Out of the street to the left," he wrote, "it's the modern public school, brown with the finishings in white, with its well-maintained gardens and gardens, to which Howard Miller was always looking, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks from all types and whatever suits the transition rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriages and sex.
Obviously this wasn't about Fodor.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston killed her by quoting men who sing grossolan songs about their beauty.
Add: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, remembers that when Hurston was swimming in the city, he usually arrived without notice in a Chevrolt triumph, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts of dignified clothing today.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr Franklin said, while others were sleeping.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But he added, taking on his chair on the courtyard on the surpassing back of Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was very likely baptized, "she never stayed long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were printed.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although once he was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in a tomb without a mark in Fort Pierce, Fla., where he lived.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, and no major conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his leave to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-course highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-course road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed The Interstate 4 across the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still taking over from a difficult period of its history.
Strong integration, in addition to other things, had put an end to the idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle on racial mix led to hatred on the door of the community's home.
"During that period, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things to the people who were sitting on one side," said Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who was killed that time.
They got a coconut from a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made the Supreme Court a request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "a insult rather than an honor for my race".
The residents now say that school disengagement, despite having been positive in some respects, dilutes the cohesion of Eatonville and restores the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher... - I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame the prejudices, as he did, with joy of himself and lines such as: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long walk for the Hurston-free tomb and began to fight for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit the library sheds, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The project of the highway arrived just as his most famous daughter had once again beamed the lights of the Ribalta.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January, many returned for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its road project.
"The five courses of the resurrected highway have brought what would be called the high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it in a simpler way: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project helped to change the image the city has of itself.
Those outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and the residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the public historical record in 1998.
A new library on a single floor (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a Kennedy Boulevard decorated and decorated.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s of 1800.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to search for the story of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most of the interview, in some things - like the walls on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat-ass teacher, with a weak for the bright red, still fears that their island community will be compromised.
However, as soon as the Hurston Festival has expanded, a high level of citizen pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, trouble and everything, no better, no worse and fair, creative, great worker, shocked and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is genuinely civic affection what can be heard in Mr. Franklin's nephew's voice, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even those younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they've just come in here, they'll think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,' said Alondra Kenon after putting it on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at the story, it's really a funny city."
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from newspaper banking and the huge television screens of Times Square, they would not be aware of being in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never find out that the glass offices, nestled on their heads by bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live the worst "gross day in office" every day since the 1929 crash.
The factories snooze metal carts for the tea through the sidewalks, carrying muffin vessels for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans drag their feet between condominiums, like human mules, 50 and stretch shirts to a stick on their backs.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 working days.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new book of saving Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the event so that it would coincide with the afternoon break to my subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a string of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's sport, to collect money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service sport, where old customers order booking books, tourists ask for directions for the big Macy store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my trust banker, were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken the savings from the smaller banks from the places where the dollars are made, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from the so-called trifts (a little like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and say to treat customers as family.
In recent years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In the last days Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was subject to controlled administration, and while the New Yorkers headed home for the weekend one Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer who saved it.
The employees and commissions who were in front of me, improvised for another coup, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more collateral at Wall Street.
The common New Yorkese in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman in my Chinese trust supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her emaciated Director General Dick Full in all familiarity, as if we were wet with a bad colleague.
And Lyn, the Portainia in uniform, almost fifty years of my condominium, has changed the subject compared to our normal conversational topic about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expenses.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!
I've changed, I'm not running any risk."
Prolonged Muslim tomb while Austria turned right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the right wing of the Party of Freedom and Filip Dewinter of the right Belgian party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization "City Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They bring signals like those street representatives mosques with a red line that passes in the middle.
The police have blamed the right extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties on the right won a lot at the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun's cemetery, near Linz, in some hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The culprits have traced with the spray Jewish symbols such as the Star of David above some graves, but the detectives think it might have been an attempt to mask extreme motivations driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the rape, which took place toward the end of Ramadan, a month of religious relevance to Muslims.
In the meantime, Austria has embarked on a journey of spiritual research following its right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right parties that took almost 30 percent of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, made a campaign with vicious anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobia critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against candles and burkas and also expressed his opposition to the food that was perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and mines, leading to political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analyses made immediately after the elections, which have established the extreme right as the nation's strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was brought to the fore by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad prohibited to Gary Glitter.
In Gary Glitter, the glamour star of the guilty rock of sexual abuse on minors, was forbidden to travel to France and Spain from the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had informed the authorities that he wanted to go to Spain through France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent's police last Thursday after giving the magistrates the proof of earlier Glitter's arrests for sexual abuse on minors.
Glitter, the true name Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's office in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesperson for the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford's border, Kent's police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present."
Glitter, 64 years of age, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the registration of sexual offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police a seven-day notice of his scheduled departure date.
The failure to notify the authority may lead to a five-year sentence.
Kent's police said they don't want to discuss the individual cases or the possible movements of Glitter in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent's police said: "Kent's police will do all they can to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the UK because we have the right complete systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted persons for sexual offences registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two boys aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have made it pass to passport control and finally took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
Finally, he arrived at Heathrow's Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for an order to include him in the register of sexual offenders.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having had images of abuses on children.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, felt assured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the teacher away from the scene to draw the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no steering wheel, no clothes from the beginning.
Only the essence of the great master of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
From the other side, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, at those moments far from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressivity of the hands, are natural because they must not go into the scene.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on the stage with the less known side of these masters.
With this aim, the photographer offers an original flamenco iconography, grasping it from various visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Flamenco Photo Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day ever more," the artist explains and explains that in "Flamenco-People" could also be common people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists, interpreters or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and catching the public.
To catch the personality of these big ones you don't have to pull them into the scene,
because their personality and character are internal.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started a long journey in 1997 to attract singers, guitarists or dancers using a photographic machine on tape.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and material, remember classical photography.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the artist's personality, his character, capable of winning the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, were and have been the constant of this work, in exposure these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a sort of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exposed during the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Retracts of veteran athletes" ("SportARTProject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to draw people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, this is a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult kind of picture.
You meet or meet people, characters you sometimes don't even know or give you just a few minutes to take the photo.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people", is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, the number 20 via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next 16th October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he's writing is a "accident"
It is environmentd in places that still do not know and deal with unknown issues: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is on the line with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Ever favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival of Segovia, that the project he is currently dealing with "is an accident" and that "all indicates that I shouldn't write it."
"If I had a good sense, I wouldn't write it, but I'll do it as well and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw passing through the city of the Acquidotto a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The city y los perros" was, as predicted, the figure of peak at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of the book "Our Mutual Friend" by Dickens, filled out the positions of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of a public to whom the time was flying when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, recalled as born in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "the pleasure of reading" and "of living beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to complement the "no inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, editing and continuous restoration; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and as "the images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an experiencing experience," said Vargas Llosa, stressing that, on the contrary, "has effects" and that "makes the most anti-conformist people." That is why he invited the writers to "do not give up on cowardice" and to "take responsibility" of his vocation.
The obstacle time the Festival of Pozoblanco, depriving him of the race
The celebration of the races that should have suggested the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the tournaments selected for the races had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Weathers came up against this Festival, preventing two days from celebrating in three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bull race.
In cartels were Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who should have faced a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was scheduled to take place only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque to triumph, cutting three ears and coming out in triumph, after having toasted with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante finished his two races by receiving greetings and an ear, given more from the public than due to the race itself.
The worst among them was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without punishment.
With the second bull, after a trembling mule, much of the public’s figurines were earned.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses the block place to Alava
Five less than ten in the morning.
Agents hire the height of the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, they hit the escape.
Agents have hired the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, they ran away.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
After they have been pursued, the officers succeed in arresting one of the two occupying officers, a man of about 28 years old, identified as A.A. J., as reported in the communication of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual is accused of drug trafficking and the falsification of public documents.
The incident occurred when some officials on the Alava road were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, at which point it went through the municipality of Arminón.
They insisted on stopping a van for inspection when the driver, overstepping the orders, rushed suddenly and crossed the stop.
The officers went to the chase until the vehicle, after a couple of miles, stopped on the edge of the road and its two occupants went to the escape in a forested area.
The officers of the Ertzaintz were therefore able to arrest one of the fugitives and kidnap the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they carried and took note of once inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish panes, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for an in-depth investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since the officials found that the matrix had been "doubled" since it did not match the one reported in the vehicle documentation, the arrest was also charged with the offence of falsifying public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing investigations to arrest the second suspect, who has managed to escape as already said, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee A.A. J. was taken to the police station to conduct the appropriate procedures and to be available to the judge within the next few hours.
Arrests Heather Lockear for guidance under the effect of drugs
The actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
One witness saw him perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the car from the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed in the People magazine by a spokesman of the California street.
The witness has specified that around 16.30 the Locklear "deeply sketched the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with push forwards and back. Making backwards, he passed several times before his sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who at first sight apparently did not recognize the actress, noticed that Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and had left the vehicle.
She was this person to alert the emergency services, because "she was concerned about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"He seemed confused," and that's why the agents took him to a specialist drug and alcohol center to test him.
According to a spokesperson of the police, the actress has been cooperative and the hypothesis of alcohol abuse has been dropped from the beginning, even though "as observed by the officers at first, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of a few medications."
Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of driving under the effect of some unspecified substances and was locked in the local prison around 7:00 p.m. to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was restored by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being discovered after an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The IU and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, today confirm that it will be up to the regional federation of the training to decide on the case of the former advisor to Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of customerism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said as regards the resolution that the party will have to adopt in relation to what has been an advisor to this day in the Civilian Council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this kind of investigation to be the most transparent."
Similarly, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public charges."
"Sangre de Mayo", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Episdios Nacionales di Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci in Sangre de Mayo proposes the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his film, with almost 15 million euros in budget.
With this film, the director tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Kim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of interpreters.
Blood de mayo, for more than two and a half hours, starts this Friday in the cinema halls, to become a television ministries in the future more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
Great admirer of Galdós literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this turn "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before turning a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2. The director agreed that the history of basses on the novel Episdios Nacionales.
The 15 million budgets allocated by the Community of Madrid have represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to re-create the appropriate scenarios and costumes to portray a "a stormy Spain that misjudged the choice of the leader for which to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence has led to a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" has been observed by Garci.
However, the director regrets that he had not received funding equal to that of Alatriste or Los phantasmas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de Mayo, so it was not possible to turn some of the scenarios he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the director of Volver at the beginning, influenced what is his usual practice of work, the setting up with the actors, with which he often tries to work together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "demeanor," considering that "part of the director's work is based on going to the theater and cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works."
Many of the interpreters, part of whom are part of the Sangre de Mayo cast, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - its Blood de Mayo, Seven tables de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles blinds - do not represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema "that should be known instead."
Garci doesn't expect prizes from this movie.
"At first you think you work for posters, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at some point you agree to just spin a movie more," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon discovers the civil essence of the ballerina Tortola Valencia
A Civilian Ballerina brings honor to another Ballerina as well as to the Civilian Ballerina.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgena Valencia Valenzuela), born in Triana district, and moved with the family to London at the age of three.
It was a free dance ballerina and a specialist in Oriental dances.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, of Isadora Duncan's caliber, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I'd like to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offers me this character.
She says: "We do not intend to tell her whole life, but to collect the spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some thongs.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my dance also comes into this aesthetic," he explains.
The stage includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his performances, as she does "The Open Door"; and that of Master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what was one of his students.
"Matilde interprets Adult Tortola, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and I am very pleased with this."
The composition also includes the musical and guitarist composition such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who interprets the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been due all round, and who have always had many pitifuls."
The work is also present in some ways the life of this woman who is taking place in faraway places, especially at that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since she was normally living in London.
"I wanted to remember it, because I think it was one of the women who had a huge influence over a period of history and now no one remembers it and so much less considers his work as something of value," says Bayon.
The show will begin today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega theatre.
With the publication of the "Diario de un a newly married poet" also closes the Triennio
The presentation of the first illustrative edition of the "Diario de un Poete Reicencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Advisor to the Culture of the Andalusia Joint to celebrate the "Third Year of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennio di Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the restoration of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Chopo de l’Light", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Advisor to the Culture of the Andalusia Joint has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Dario de un Poete Reiencasado", taken care of by Peter Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the highest-value Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"God sometimes creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in view of the shocking idea that Newman went there.
Yet it cost him a lot to deliver an Oscar to him.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And he also knew he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a test goes beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better thanks to their existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died in a particularly dark moment, for fear of terrorists and the markets, with the self-contained American people on the ground, to desperate search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men like that without virtue and are good people to admire, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he was incarcerated by the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and winning causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the dead firstborn of overdose to the creation of the food brand domestic and biological.
All gifts to a country where it's a lot more expensive to go beyond a suicide food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without caring for nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, noticed that he didn't kill a man, a time was over.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, director of Oscar's award, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the appetite of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, had just happened to define Paul Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He has left an example of a very high level for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping the need for justice high in mind and having a serious private life and away from cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try us, and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he remained faithful even though he certainly did not miss the opportunity to be.
"Why am I going out to eat burgers today, if I have a steak at home?" she used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Among the great roles he played, none of them were as proud as that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a zealous grandfather and a passionate philanthropy," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we followed the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was far longer the worst he'd ever attended.
A lot of shocks, if they were then taken into account in the assessment and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The shocks began with the withdrawal of the back, which assumed that it was going first.
It didn't seem like a bad idea, but if you're forced to go, that's to take everything away (including the chip to avoid codes during the race).
Not at all.
You had to go just to take the backrest (first shock, go only for this) and (after the relative tail), surprised! they had only 'S' size shirts (second shock, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are ineligible compared to the day of the race itself.
Besides having to go very soon to get the chip, the waiting line was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the bag.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as was foreseeable, the race began that we had not even deposited the bag, although once the company succeeded, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the expectation of more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion were added and attacked at the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even result in the correct classification due to the chip that, I suppose, did not correctly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will certainly not enter my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented in advance a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case described by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the campus of the company) by assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of facial recognition, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who are - including to remember their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
It can also group people into conversation groups.
In the video for example, the receptionist detects a third person, but realizes that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and tells them he'll be at his disposal shortly.
Everything without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week a lot has been said about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with essential and less commercial vacuum functions, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "the least".
All one discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciated.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is becoming more and more important, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly stress that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for the hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same for your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People always pay less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the Web browser.
You only take the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome – and we spend more time online than in a remote window environment.
What are half of the operating system's applications used?
It's less than that.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to make it a valid alternative to Google.
They need a desperate need, in fact, and I give you a small example here.
I took the photo inserted in this post in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the machine of drinks a folder urges them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that 66% of Microsoft employees are using Google to perform a network search.
Last week, last week, it was confirmed the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be placed on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is criminalizing.
La Fabuleus Marcel
Pablo Picasso was taking her to the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio was playing in 'Diamante de bloodre' by Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino's 'Il Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola as well as being part of the typical uniform of the gay muscle parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can withdraw the image of the force with the buffs pointed up that lifts the weights in the walking circuit.
It is, in essence, the typical machete by man, with the inside of cotton, glued and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, even though Belgian Fabuleus Marcel stands above all.
The "Marcel" stands out above the others for the high quality cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive stamp and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the carpet carry as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" is superior to the others for the high quality cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive stamp and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic carpet models carry as a detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian company does not only concern the famous 'tank'.
It also includes college velvet, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, sailor shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothes designed to be comfortable.
And it's a sin to use them as an intimate white woman.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't care"
The great similarity with the sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, Sisters Cruz have taken their new activities in the field of fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their own name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that Mango has made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
He's hot and shy. He wins you fast.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that we have invented my sister Penelope and me for the autumn-winter season in Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honour of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time exciting.
What are the elements of your new collection for Mango in this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the movie of the 1950s and '60s, so we're getting a lot of inspiration from here.
Then I love losing myself in the city and watching women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do it often.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, even if at the end, everything is inconclusive and there are many elements in common.
To me, even to a child, they liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to enjoy my aunt's wardrobes and to see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a ballerina, I've always paid a lot of attention to dress.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to lessons and wisdom, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you are delivered the wardrobe is the moment when you really meet the character.
So everything goes together, yes, with great respect for the stylists and the professionals.
Not long ago, you were 30 years old, you got into a crisis?
Not at all.
Never heard better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to enjoy life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think of becoming a mother, don't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because she asks me about my own body and I also want to be a young mom, I don't want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do will give my son great happiness and educate him with love.
As for the cinema, you're waiting for some film to be filmed in the different rooms last year.
That's exactly what I want them to do.
Being a woman coming from the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, I'd like it all right away and clearly, but it can't always be that way.
I want you to go "the last hour" and "Seeking the tomb of Christ."
Let's see if you like it.
A few days ago, you got on the pass with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I've been on a walker like a model.
Just Naomi Campbell, who has known me for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity show for her organization "Done for a better world" and the clothes we have displayed – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – were auctioned to raise funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this side of Naomi.
They say so many things about you, that I know her for a long time, I can confirm that they're not so true.
Also, I find myself with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to show up for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pin, I would do the same.
If it's to help women in the third world, you can't go back.
Reusual alcoholic drivers will need to install the "alcohol"
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol, to install in their car the system that prevents the driving of the vehicle in a state of gravity or if it does not blow on the device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the General Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which it will be a pilot project of one year's duration.
The aim of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the Directorate-General for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the drivers reported more than once for driving in a state of pregnancy then drive the car again.
Alcohol would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the breathing air and prevents driving if the driver does not blow, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than that permitted.
The cost is more than EUR 1000 and would be charged to the sentenced person.
In this respect, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with such devices would reduce up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
In order to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out on a regular basis, and, without a doubt, the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, even though it has already been introduced in an experimental way into some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on an initiative by the PSOE in which it is proposed to install this system on school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the second program, the Spanish aircraft in which the Asturias principles were traveling landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was rising but the rays were still forcing the hand to be seen as a visionary to see the real couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver, along the road, if he knew that the Spanish authorities were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... she's from here or...
- No, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who are the Asturias principles and the importance of travel.
There are many those waiting in the airport hangar that are smashed to the red carpet and the military cordon composed of 27 Marine soldiers offering the honour.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the princess, calls to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they reported that in Mexico City there was a bad time.
They give the photographers a smile and a brief stop before going into the room where the official community awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the four largest in the city, awaits them a spiritual reporter of Mexican television.
Best award offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world most suitable to present a fashion prize, which is not Paris and probably there is no more exquisite and vibrant Valentine's bont.
Mango just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in Mango's glass at the number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept out of emotion.
In addition, it is the second wholesale company in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square metres of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, coupled with the desire to please the Stylist Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, started with a luxury dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite TVs, the presidential table of gala prepared by Mango, it was even more spectacular.
Born, with the heart broken and making necessary virtues, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some ELAH supplements to remove the fiat and arm of the son Luis - a boy nearly two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the chairmanship of the tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, has done the honors of the house and to knight who has finished, together with Barone Rotchil, without jacket, because they both gave them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in pants and shirts – designed by her hand – was transformed for dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo in the work, when they showed us the hall for ballet lessons and she, remembering other times, caught up with a bar and knocked down a "great pie".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the palace premises, but had shown us his son's photos on the phone before.
The following day we were happy for the presence of Olivier Martinez – other boys who moved on the bike – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his linens, his towels and his insurance in advance, that there was no smell in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and one way to forget the chaotic and frenzy daily life.
And as if that weren't enough, they're all collected in a book that will bring the relaxation in the libraries on September 30.
Awakening is almost a punishment when it comes every morning at 7:00 a.m. but it is even worse to imagine involved in the frenzy dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer's bad back.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhausting and fatigue from the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond the yoga positions, the classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of his book, all a "menu" of options in measure for each taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the libraries thanks to the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone thinks that it is not possible to gain peace in areas such as work or in personal relations, this "manual" lacks such conviction.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline does not already flow into your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, shut your mind and concentrate on reading.
Talk in the sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who are very excited to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who speak are still asleep.
The first time it happens, it's most scary, but it doesn't really matter much.
This is a mild change in sleep defined as sleepiness.
It is manifested at a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, most of you have told me that you spoke in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing more.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as incubes, night fear, night enuresis (to make the bed pipe), or sunnambulism, but not necessarily so.
As already noted above, it can be associated with very high fever levels, stress situations or overcrowding.
In any case, it is still a not studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or if the opposite occurs (sighs, yells, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, you should observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there are any issues that are generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a result of the situation.
We have said that this is a benign change, so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (e.g. if combined with insomnia or stress).
What can be done, however, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to bed.
Suggest quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that cause fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them to gain some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
Once the dreamers show up, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the day after it will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because it's not aware of what's going on, and you interrupted him.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and then he's resting.
Remember that if you seem very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency, it is better to consult a doctor or check where this is the cause of such great anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to ask him for information.
You won't get anything, because he's asleep and so he doesn't know how to organize his thinking.
In addition, you are able to hear what you say but not see what you are dreaming to say, so you need to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which they might lead.
Never tell the child that you could ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not for a joke.
Something like this is causing enormous anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Island user... finally
Illhaeuern finally found the way home victory after a long fruitful period.
Without playing a great game, the Yellow Negroes created the largest number of network opportunities by transforming one into the match win.
The rhythm was not much supported during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves tired.
After a first attempt by the captain of the Kauffmann host team who blew the seven with a long shot, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from the far, then High Hirn, Romein from the point and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block at the center of the field, leaving only the Riahi chain at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed by Riahi and Temporale for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first Marais network for the Illhaeusen, well-positioned, he took up a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the cannon of Illhaeusen will not be able to enjoy his long happiness and will be expelled a dozen minutes after leaving his teammates in digital inferiority.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not cause great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeuern, directed just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a rocking action, the ball blew the cross.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in the hills
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a step in Britain.
Prior to the demonstration of fishermen who brutally prevented access to various British and Norwegian ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in the Finistère department to please his representatives.
The latter have promised to accept it "with a constructive spirit" and hope that they will "present themselves with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time with the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by British fishermen in order to take measures to deal with the impoverishment of the gas price, which reached its record with an average of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Eliseo's spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and ensure working conditions and pay for the sailors".
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand firm.
On Tuesday morning, they led "lumaca operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of ingestion.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but the connections with Belle-île have not been interrupted.
A roadblock has been implemented on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors had already proved their determination by burning tires and pallets from dawn in front of the fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Loricent, while they held demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the fishermen remained at the mill, or in Havre, where twenty battles prevented the ship from moving from trade.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Atlantic Loire, interrupted in the evening the Donges Total Refinery Note block.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held in the ministry on Wednesday to decide on any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and possible participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not give up" and "they do not intend to move to Paris," announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Loricent Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on petrol, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a vessel will be reached only with less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and still Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of the movie and actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
This year, the aircraft construction company has 215 deliveries, despite the threats of recession that affect the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth world company in the sector, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian company is widely trusted in the Chinese market, especially for the aircraft of the range between 30 and 120.
To this day, Embraer delivered 41 flights to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would give more than 15% of its activities
The American International Group insurance company, which was set up by the American monetary authorities, would give more than 15% of its business in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Financial Times Sunday edition.
The AIG is prepared to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and to the United States, specifying the newspaper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider any transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
The activities that AIG intends to surrender include the International Lease Financial Corp. air lease subsidiary, its share of 59% of the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on such transfers, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion concessional from the Federal Reserve, at the expense of the American authorities requiring 80% of its capital.
Paris: Cronistora Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives expressed itself against the Paulson plan for the rescue of financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, i.e. a drop ever seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq lost 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) is finished at 10.365.45, down by 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684,81 points) than that of 17 September 2001, the date of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
Nasdaq, the index of main technological titles, lost 199,61 points closing at 1,983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (i.e. 106,85 points) closing at 1,106,55 points, which are at the final closing figures.
Democratized at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street is deep after the unexpected rejection of the bank's rescue plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two Republicans in three have rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piezza, of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how much the market was counting on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were actually dying (...) then the witness would be quickly passed to the Fed – Federal Reserve – (the American central bank, ndr) and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, responsible for the financial and economic sector at the Global Insight.
And while still stressing the state of emergency," every day that goes by leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Piezza stressed.
Following the failure of the mutual Washington on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by the rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated abruptly, urging the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany banks to intervene urgently, signaling that the markets "are not only faced with an American crisis, but with a global crisis", FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The yield of the 10-year-old Treasure Goods is returned to 3,632%, against 3,827% on Friday evening, while the 30-year-old is 4,161%, against 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama for the first television duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House, there is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic Campaign announced the respective victory of the television duo, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although worthy, was not bright enough to allow him to slow down in five-week polls by the presidents.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published on Saturday, granted an advantage of five points in Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the democrat had the best.
A instant survey conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them considered Obama the winner, while 25% pointed to McCain.
An excellent performance by his fellow listed Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debated with the rival Sarah Palin, should confirm on Thursday Obama's advantage.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He's got a good idea," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The Seventeenth McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, stressing the "ingenuity" of the opponent regarding the issues addressed during the first face-to-face.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that.. he has often said many times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the skills necessary to become president," he said.
What has been a constant target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without extending, it proved to be clear and precise.
It has promoted its predisposition to the right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, contrary to Obama," he reiterated, this weekend, a democratic spot, urging the Republic not to take the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety-nine minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, he complained yesterday to Obama, in front of 20,000 people meeting in North Carolina, under a rainstorm, for an election meeting.
He has not even pronounced the words "media class" or "workers".The financial crisis is in favour of Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the precipitation.
"The next week could be a decisive turnout," thought the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic intuition to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reducing the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's results, the Senator of Illinois also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of potential energy independence in the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a 45 nuclear centre park by 2030.
Carefully, the two candidates took advantage of requests focused on the $700 billion financial rescue plan (470 billion euros) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening after the closing of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the legislation.
While the results were still waiting, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignations".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "To what pro? They will do what they want, of my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good figure for external observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take democratic action.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of goods, could be lifted if these elections were considered legitimate by the observers.
I wasn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral committees and our observers have not been able to participate in the robbery of the votes," lamented Iour Potemkine, spokesman of the Union of the Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a face-to-face change, says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidents and head of the pro-European movement, because the important is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If opposition Members enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can lead to a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore has the duty to get into the political game because " dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, is in crisis, and we do not provide for any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protector.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that ‘the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that has followed the electoral process recognises the validity of the vote.
It underlines that the participation rates seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) has led to all kinds of manipulation.
"Have you noticed there were elections? Ask the Social-Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will have been at least five Members of the opposition to Parliament, the most suitable for power."
The night silence falls on the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Committee are pleased with their success.
Meeting - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday's tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Québec has become one of the world's safest and most effective blood suppliers.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, seriously removed from the blood-infected scandal in the years from 1980 to 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus in the 1980s.
In the face of such a drama and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation in February 1994 , led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the reproposal of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was delaying a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of developing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, 38% of the people said that they still had confidence in the system of donations in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was killing.
Thanks to the continued efforts to improve the safety of blood collection and field research over the years, we have regained public confidence," he said, before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "confidence is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of foundation.
"And we didn't know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports that when you have doubts and you may have a serious illness, in this case the patient of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, who manifests a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, will take measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than one month in the United Kingdom was refused.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that there is no doubt that this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has shown us so that it has made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for identifying HIV appeared on the market: nuclear acid (TAN) tests that directly recognize the presence of the virus in the donor blood and not that of antibodies against it, on which the tests used so far were based.
TAN allowed to reduce the window period, i.e. since the person contracted the disease to the one where the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them is thus significantly reduced.
These improvements have resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of anti-AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one out of 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV has been reported with a transfusion.
I believe that today you can feel calm about receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to restore health, says Hema-Quebec's head.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the Réunion Island that, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by an insect.
It must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continues before stressing that, in addition to having safe resources, Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient resources.
"The needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
Being the most aggressive cancer cure, patients often need a contribution of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the number of donors, which on average account for only 3% of Quebec's population is acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who are 18 years old and who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of those offering themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is spread, they will be refused for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we can maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
The cases of poverty are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they age and cannot make any more donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold it and encourage it to become regular donors.
Today's life is so frenetic that it is difficult to find an hour to donate blood," says poor Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, eyelids and skin heart valves that are used almost exclusively for severe use.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are deposited with Hema-Québec, which manages the only public bank of the umbelic cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which once was considered a biomedical discharge, there is plenty of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion into the bank of our thousandth blood sample of cordon and we expect to take more than a thousand each year.
It should begin with proposals for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of taking cord blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to you," because Hema-Québec does not have the means necessary to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Calcium - The Impact in Semifinal
The Impact Montreal qualified for the semifinal of the A series eliminations, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a second decisive match of the final quarters, at the Saputo Stadium.
The Central Campist Antonio Ribeiro, marked the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first time with no goal from both sides, David Texto and Rocco Placentino marked the following networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
We remember that at the first round of the return trip on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps of Vancouver in a semifinal.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thundler completed a first 3-1 in the return game winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still take part in the semifinal.
The Impact will have to face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed on the day.
In brief - decisive network of Kovalev
The Canadian and its axes are ready to begin the season.
The trio format by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn has animated the offensive game phase by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, took two steps, and collected a pass for victory, in the fourth of the preparatory games of the Hab.
Decided for victory the only network signed by Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, he warned the Russians.
I need another game to feel at my disposal."
"He tried to figure it out in the first period, he noticed Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation."
Charest Point North
The Prime Minister shall not exclude the start of the elections before the end of the year.
Finally, the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean-Charest, took place yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tried to elect himself during the partial elections today.
"Enlarge the borders of our last great north border": this long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, through instruments of strong visual impact, on the occasion of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, was the projection of a kind of "Mulino to images".
On three max screens, they confused the spectacular negatives of hydroelectric digs, mining, pictures of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means like in the full election campaign.
During the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the start of the autumn elections, even though he noted that he was very busy.
The "Nordic Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on manpower, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the most recent speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North-the northern territory to the 49th parallel- was never the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was limited to explaining why the North would be "a joy from the immense potential", but he did not speak about timing or investment quotas, nor did he explain what the precise priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
More than anything else, it has been limited to indicating what it considers to be a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but especially the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
Standing on the Charest-style list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "great territory is double of France", it is here, is Quebec.
Not only is he here, but he is instigated in us," he insisted, as he wanted to urge a national founder myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the February of gold in Abitibi, the National Engineering, the Bay of James.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense picture on his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, has specified the prime minister during the press conference.
"It's a traditionally maintained position by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been in force for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he said.
After all," considering climate change, we need to re-evaluate the North," he said, speaking of the north-west transition, which will be open all year round because of the ice meltdown.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty."
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (ex-deputy of the PQ of Ungava), have already given way to consultation of thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transports and Natural Resources) took on an important role, started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be concerted, ordered and will respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the early liberal ministers who preceded it.
"As the Liberals who have preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to re-establish the Beauharnois Central in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, creator of the Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Burrassa, creator of the Bay of James, our party has always been able to forges the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he used another reference, conservative this time, the program "Road to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Faced with the project relating to the hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest stated that its implementation would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed to his militants, raising applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who claimed that there would be no elections in April in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not cancel the opportunity to start a poll in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
It underlines that it is certainly very busy, particularly in a federal council mission in China and at the Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chapter with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" that passed loose like oil: the PLQ claims above all the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will be appointed by the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the abolition of the Northern Plan has been sceptically accepted.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, has resold the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not respect its application.
If he had, we would have made progress today," said Marois next to the candidate of Jean-Talon (scriution today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has stated that it supports the adoption of the Northern Plan by the government.
"What we hope for is that all this is not simply perceived as a show," commented the leader Sébastien Proulx, replaced by Mario Dumont, back today by the holidays.
Letter - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (Iron of luck) of the Harper cabinet, to allow himself to say last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "grave" for Canada.
In this way, dishonoring a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the circle of the prime minister and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, who has not repatriated a citizen held in the Guantanamo concentration area.
A government that takes nothing into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a simple teenager at the time of the alleged facts.
The only government that, despite the signing of the Geneva Convention, has refused its word and lets a child-soldier march in human conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, for information purposes, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Order of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, invoke Omar Khadraf's reparation in order to be subjected to a regular process in Canada.
It is exactly the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does little matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after many years of overcrowding.
We are still unaware of this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop coughing and that sounds so foolish on his lips.
Here we come at a time when there is no morale anymore: you can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a leader of government until today's minority (to see what will happen after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect of the Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has given up what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
It is here that shame, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing a Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest aurifera company has sports a wave for defamation by six million against three authors and a small square editing house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a demand for defamation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring ruin to anyone who would support a position contrary to his.
The outcome of the process, writers and editors of the book Canada Black will have to spend a sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with decisive learning weapons, against an army of lawyers funded by the pockets practically without the funds of the mining company.
Furthermore, in these fights against learning weapons, the tactics are often to break the agreed agreement in order to impose a consensus regulation that undermines the opposition and scares anyone to speak again about the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted to have a public debate, it was before the public opinion that he should have presented his own vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada the debates are normally held with the exchange of views and not with the impact of manganella.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open its books, documents and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent researchers who could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much confidence in the public opinion and misappropriate requests and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a public debate when his contempt for the same public is clearly evident?
In the world of the vice-president, this word seems to indicate exclusively the perfumed lawyers, not the whole of the Canadians; here is a rather narrow vision of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand – or doesn't want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Canada Nero does so primarily because he rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a sort of impoverishment (by seeking the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Nero an ultimatum urging them to suspend the use of that word...)
Apart from Garver's surreal speech, Barrack Gold's sport is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of the truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It rejects the right to quote authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis for intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss issues that are bothering the richest companies in the world, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted to have a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards as the authors of Black Canada do.
He has the right to reproduce.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to manage debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures of Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek at all a transparent debate.
This goes beyond the university world, as is the case with the same public debate in Canada, and it is now that governments are taking measures to limit abuse.
Operation - salvation for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, representatives of republican and democratic slump, finally reached agreement yesterday on the largest saving-financial plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion US dollars plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has lasted for months on Wall Street, is still to be ratified by the two Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for checks on its effective implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses paid for non-payments, as well as a right of inspection of the remuneration paid to the managers of the protected companies.
The American Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on markets," said Bush Administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis at Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, unestimable discomforts and disturbances would have turned to the everyday life of the Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The time limit agreed was the opening of the markets this morning.
After the negotiations, the two candidates to the US Presidents proved to be rather favourable to the agreement, but without avoiding expressing their discontent before the adoption of extreme solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves to have added some provisions to the agreement, in particular that will enable owners to maintain their own home and that belonging to the salaries of the heads of undertakings covered by the State.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze its details, but I hope so."
"As I read it, it's something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward"
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion-dollar plan is aimed at re-purchaseing the taxpayers' money, the risk- and inventible assets of the American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the break-up of a real estate ball that has led first to the collapse of mortgage credit at risk (mutual) and then to extend to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and to drain into the freezing of liquidity and the disposal of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge of sending the first draft of an agreement last week.
It seems to have been out of that blind neighborhood since the Democrats agreed that the "toxic" activity of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than bought.
In order to meet everyone at Congress, a provision was added that if the government had to deal with losses during the five-year period due to this programme, it could impose new taxes to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
In exchange for its aid, Washington will receive participation shares in protected companies that will benefit from dividends in the event of profit and that will be able to sell when the waters have calmed down.
As set out in the plan, the federal government will have the possibility of delaying the pecuniary procedures for real estate loans and setting limits on the remuneration and compensation paid to the managers of the companies involved.
From today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be set free.
In fact, there were several votes against the project yesterday, both at the republican and democratic level.
"Of course Washington doesn't hear you," said President Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber's Financial Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not to take advantage of the taxpayers..
Leader of a small group at Congress called "the Caucus of Sceptics", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred leading economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to carefully examine the way to be taken," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again a witness to the evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas indicated that it would have given up its competitor, in full failure after the loss of EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) for the crisis of real estate loans at risk in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is one of the twenty largest banks in Europe and ten largest insurers.
"It's not the lost money, Dutch Finance Minister Wooter Bos said yesterday.
On the other hand, there is a risk of influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It's certainly something that rescuers and families appreciate now that the times are uncertain."
During this period, on the other end of Manica, the British government seems to nationalise another bank for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would charge the total of loans currently under way at Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you to buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was its axis in the handle for a long time, for others its weak point.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the amusing smile?
Yeah, no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have driven him out of that circle of powerful devotees to true sacred monsters.
What a constant!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the past few years.
Less monumental of Brando, which he resembled and of which he was along a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but he also spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
From mixed couples, magic babies are often born.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 by German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots it will be one of the glorious dreams of the American dream.
A humble ego, last quality brand.
Because in him was recognized all a country invaded by the safe made man, the combatant of the Pacific War, proud in the fight, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, on television and soon at the cinema.
The same militant man for civil rights was also the motorist driver who classified himself according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as six symbols, although part of a couple model since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward.
If you go with him the shadow areas of a reserved, discreet, committed star, allergic to the show-business scandals, of which you will never be able to fully reveal the mystery.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a blow to the heart of the movies, while his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through its interpretations.
The fascinating butch Cassidy cow-boy (1969) and the boy unable to desire the focus wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the roof that was adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him in the clothes of sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that didn't keep what he promised.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone through history.
The boxer Rocky Grazian, criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Lassú loves me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean and was arrested after his death, who officially launched Newman in 1956.
The sympathetic villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best movie in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Lo Spaccone, magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The Color of Martin Scorsese's money, which was the only Oscar on 9 nominations in 1987.
That face over the years was his.
Even him.
The ages take place through his path.
Young people know him especially for the cult movement Slap Shot-Dark by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of a hockey team on low-orthodox ice.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, Coen's brothers.
The circle was closed with a last role as father of the Irish Mafia in Era my father in 2003.
Unlike the most legendary degrees of cinema that soon left the trade, Newman will stay long in the halls, reporting Hollywood throughout his funeral, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, defined him, with an irony point, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging that his performance was exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to which the roles seemed to fall like a mannequin from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginate to the role of the young actor: neurotic characters, drunk or desperate, from which he expressed dismay and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As director, Newman revealed unknown fragrances of his true, pudding sensitivity.
The first time that Jennifer was born in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with wife Joanne Woodward in the role of the protagonist, was drawing a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost Scott's son for an overdose, dedicated Harry and Son, discreet and sad movie in 1984.
Among the countless tributes given yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old weapons partner Robert Redford (they read together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness "His presence made my life and this country better".
Generosity and love for life, two great features of the missing actor.
In addition to a legendary career, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protestor of the Hollywood drift, is being released.
We'll have pulled his face out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging him to a bad taste, though born as a gag.
However, the revenues of those sales were intended for its foundation for childhood in difficulty.
Newman, instead of adjusting to his myth, chooses to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that he said "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
It was a privilege."
And it was just as privileged for us to follow the path of such a clean and generous American artist.
Citizen model, then, and much more.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & partners invoice factory?
In the meantime, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and its partners will be discussed.
The political man and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed under a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including falsification of documents.
According to the Investigation, the money obtained from competition bands was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the execution of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million flowers, is partly ended in the banks of Fiatal Balldal, in part in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they have taken the money obtained from competition bands on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never complied with the obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To do so, invoice blocks were purchased on the Józsefváros market, and circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And in order to decide which companies to issue the invoices, it was established among others during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for consumption, on the model of these then invoices were prepared to be added to the competition bands, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Many of these are works by István Lados and András Õri which, according to our information, has drawn up, above all, the reports needed to obtain funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "student trip" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its members in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
But so many people, as the restaurant says, would not all come together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 at the Job Jöv ́ért Foundation, hereinafter called Együtt at Harmadik Évèvredért, is a receipt of formal and content errors.
A Badacsonytomaj pension has only three rooms, more than 10 people couldn't stay with us, but in the invoice there were 130 guests.
But the collectors of fantasy invoices exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., this also deals with restaurant, in which the accounts - according to the information given to the judicial authorities - were not even the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jöv ́ért and Hoppá.
Mr. Farkas, the company's administrator, said to hvg.hu that when he was summoned to search and showed him the invoices, he realized that it was false documents.
"On the seal the name and the game Iva of our company were in the wrong point."
He added: apart from the formal reasons, he did not return even the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people were accommodated, when there were eleven rooms in total and there were not so many beds.
By the way, the bill was restaurant and their restaurant is no longer in operation for a long time.
The bill collectors were not concerned about informing themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizing only foreign travel, so they were shocked at the invoice with payment in cash travel in Hungary, which did not agree with the company's billing practice.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was included in the invoice, while VAT is exempt from travel to countries outside the European Union.
Among other things, the amount of IVA was wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jöv Saying Foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it was necessary to apply the IVA to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, as well as the hotel employees only issued printed invoices, while the invoice manufactured was written by hand.
In addition, the "issuers" have broken other invoices, in the case of an undertaking they have indicated how the transport of goods on the road has been carried out, as we know from the proceedings of the Court of First Instance, activities which were not carried out by the company originally founded on investment advice.
In addition, for formal defects - cause of non-conformity invoice format, fake stamp - it has been discovered that invoices issued in favour of Együtt to Harmadik Évérdért Alapítvány of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same has happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The falsifiers did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, which is why the company's liquidator, according to our information, refused to issue that invoice.
They've knowingly issued invoices.
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of the need to issue invoices.
The Esély Budapest Alapítvány Foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Balldal - Ifjú Socialisták for the Együtt Foundation at Harmadik Évezredért of nearly 4 million flowers.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, convinced the director of the Collab Kft. to issue fictional invoices.
He collaborated with Zuschlag and partners with the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million flowers to the Jobb Jövˈért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlas Egyesület association and the Vörösfeny ˈ Egyesület association, after which there was no real economic activity.
No movement of money because the invoices were then broken, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
The following group of companies issuing invoices belongs to those who are related to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to run the General Director of the Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but unreperable, which deals with fuel and car trade.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 concerning the sale of computer tools for a value of around 18 million flowers.
According to the data of the investigation, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation has purchased these invoices since 14 September 2005.
The Director-General of this company was a Romanian who, between 2002 and 2005, Ivan Kubatov would have forwarded the documents concerning the company.
As far as we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlas, Hoppá and Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the countervalue was taken from him.
At Ivan Kubatov's express request, Romanian walls founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, in fact none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant, they had not received work.
However, companies have become useful to him because at the request of the co-rapporteur Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to Zuschlag-related associations: Atlasz and Y-Generació.
On behalf of the Cash Investment companies, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued to the various institutions 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million flowers.
The investigation considers that Kubatov has charged 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition band.
Y-Generation and Sjövetség in Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a band for the public utility institution of the Socialist Party, Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 head flowers but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the band.
To prevent this from happening, they presented to the TMA five invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Public Education.
In the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already done, will probably refer to the progress in the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the tax number one, János Zuschlag, would decide to raise the veil over everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and even though he has promised several times to speak in an extensive way, he has not yet done so.
If it is in his interest, it could also be that the Socialists have taken agreements with Zusi, which - in exchange for a 50 million flowers, much of the damage - would be willing to do the scapegoat.
Zuschlag could also have offended itself for now because his requests for relief of his prison conditions, that is, the granting of house arrests, have not yet found an explanation.
While the authors of irreparable and causing much greater damage may freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of overselling: why spend more money?
Buyers are willing to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Researchers neurologists and economists at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published on Science magazine, men do not want to stay back in a competition such as eBay auction, so they are also available to pay a higher price.
The research has tried to trace the nervous scheme of this "party" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the people involved in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but in the game of auction, in which the essential element is to bid more than the other, the body stretched under the brain cortex becomes intensively functioning when you lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise in price is explained by scanning the true reaction of the stretched body.
In order to support their theory, the economists of the research group conducted a financial investigation.
In this investigation, three groups have appealed against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported the actual value of the product concerned and made them their point.
To another group, they have also promised that in the event of winnings they will receive another $15 prize.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost the money if the auction was lost.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the winning was highlighted, while for the other the loss.
Checking the hypothesis of the neurologists the members of the group who played "against loss" were willing to make higher points of the control group or "winning".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, they have so far explained the phenomena that are susceptible to auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image helped resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we came to a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to talk to your doctor?
Almost half a billion people in the world are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C, but chronic liver diseases are mentioned in Hungary among the first causes of death.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients increases to one hundred thousand, of which only 7,000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know how to be infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typical are hepatitis and ittery, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen agent: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal loss, salt).
For those travelling it is useful to immunize against virus A and B, against C no vaccine exists.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of infected foods, accompanied by general nausea, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After they form yellow spots on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and the dark urine, the healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, causing liver and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason, according to estimates, is that only one person in ten receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and tumours.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subdominate the liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical tests.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Because also a routine laboratory test reveals the disease is worth addressing your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so it stops the infective power and can prevent the formation of tumors.
On September 30, it is the world day of the hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 around the world by associations of patients.
The aim is to draw attention to the chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to a recent survey, religious faith works as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, reported the British Telegraph.
In the context of a rather bizarre investigation, an electroshock was performed to 12 Catholic believers and to similar atheists, while all who observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
Based on the results, the Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for controlling the pain.
The test is the first of a series of research in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University also take part.
The test took place exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the ring of Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the exam hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a sort of religious state among the believers, while Leonardo's picture was chosen because it was not too different from the other and they considered it to be a calming effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time zone they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the painting on a religious theme or the other.
The Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "sure", as if "someone took care" of them and "they were calm and were overcome by peace".
Looking at the image on the religious theme, they accounted for 12% less pain than when they had before themselves the work of Leonardo.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image of the strong effect even for atheists, but we need to find the right image.
"We need to look for an image to which they nurture very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the search.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains if the believers are presented with the painting of a lady of Leonardo or another painter of such a caliber, what effect could it have on the control of the pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the day of the tenth birthday, Google can claim to be in the pockets of people as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which ambulatory they attend and what they care about.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, this is not enough.
What concerns the skeptics who compare with the Orwellian incubator, they do not actually see the web 2.0 substance.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect as many personal data as possible from its users, and this is necessary to meet Google's original founding goal that was: "let's insert into a system all the world's information!".
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still in the beginning to be able to manage all the information.
To the question what will happen in five years Schmidt answered: would he like to know if Google could answer questions like "what am I doing tomorrow?" or "what would the job be appropriate for me?", but software doesn't know how to answer seemingly simple questions because they don't know enough of the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their Internet searches the exact words you are looking for are recorded, which IP addresses you are looking for, and on which page the interested ones are stopped after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago users can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have looked for and clicked, and then they will generate results on a much better scale; on this same logic it is based on Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously stated and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they see what I'm doing? - the concerned users are asked about the monopoly of Google data.
In most cases, netizens' counter-reactions are caused by the fear proven by the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even by the rebellion of power.
One fact is confirmed, however, that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but can also be provided to third parties in justified cases, in such cases nothing defends the personal rights of the internet users.
The most outstanding example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google has provided the Brazilian government with information that has made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Google-maintained community Orkut page.
On the other hand, Internet users concerned with personal rights have been relieved in May when the company - in agreement with the EFF's association of electronic legal protection - has successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: it cannot be forced by Google at any point in the constitution to provide any information requested secretly by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully removed almost 50,000 Web addresses and thousands of search expressions obtained in connection with the confirmation of the child protection law approved years ago, but it has not been able to obtain the search lists of individual users and the full list of web pages and keywords of two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data spread Google because they believe that this will affect their intimate sphere and private life by starting to use their services and rising with the rebellion that lies ahead for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and the proliferation of computer enthusiasts, activists and users in many countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rivals, Microsoft liquidated as the world's conqueror because of Windows, as both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for their services, the source code always kept up to date and the software package is much more accessible, young and cooler than the official software crash practice.
But it can also happen because the geeks see exactly the problem relationship between personal and internet rights, which implies one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, web 2.0.
The web 2.0 speaks only of collaboration, leaving intentionally traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: show ourselves.
A young average can create profiles in several community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists your musical tastes, all of which can be included in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs that automatically appear on your most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read of numerous cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common circle of friends, comes easily to know who spent the night with her perfect boy or a company can fire a employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the company's top: one thing is sure, the concept of private life now has been completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make it possible to show themselves and thus we can formulate the fundamental thesis that lies behind the behavior of young people.
Whoever wants to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopoly can do it (for example, starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but at the same time does not automatically leave track).
There are few people who don't register on community pages to not be found, Google's online apps, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best existing profile.
The public opinion does not even wait so secretly when Google will remove the articles.
Currently, the company with its $156 billion worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel $124 billion) or Coca Cola $110 billion, AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the entrances of advertising agencies, and record-time services cause serious problems not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development companies.
However, critical observers also find alarming points: the corporate summit, for example, has completely rejected the workers' protest after doubled the right of business asylum, has considered it too expensive to repeat the daily restoration to please employees, but this all diminishes in front of the fact that in 2006 Google has chained the head to the Chinese government and under their agreement the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to publish a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the next months and years will remove the world in one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines by Google will assume such proportions that the company will soon find itself in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, others are afraid of the health system, in fact we can create our health profile with our references, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic base can offer good material to the next generation of fantasy writers, the story Scroogled of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped Ózd's double murder to get rid of the tracks
The police interrogated two minors about the double murder of Ózd, who were deeply suspected of having helped to clear up the tracks of the crime - said the spokesperson for the Borsod Police Question Tuesday.
Young people have acknowledged the crime against them, they are currently accused of favor.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI's information, defend themselves freely.
The favor is punishable up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of Ózd's double murder, a 23-year-old man from the scene, was detained on Sunday.
He's suspected of a premeditated multi-micide committed for profit.
The investigation revealed that the young 20-year-old had a large debt with a man of 53 years.
The suspect did not want to settle the debt, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor with a lie in a Ózd cellar where he and his 9-year-old daughter were killed.
According to MTI's information, the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the scene.
The police are investigating the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in hand with the Polish state which intends to sell within a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press so far, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange presented an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner among all concerned and did not exclude that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion crowns.
Under the shareholder agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Banca Česká Sporijtelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 11 September".
The global financial disaster has occurred thanks to the American President - he accuses the Republic - who has not been able to compact his party behind a law that is quickly abolished, whose aim is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as Superintendent Warren Buffet said, it would be more accurate to speak of a second September 11th.
A part of Madrid's press also sees the sinister cap in Washington.
According to El World, the lack of American political leadership has cast the world economy on the edge of the rock.
The risk of the collapse of the American financial system is growing and will then be felt by the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the congress vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means of managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation of the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to leave the threat - mention the Geneva Tags-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still offer a life jacket to the financial institutions and taxpayers' money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as a domino effect, then neither financial resources nor new solutions will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union must overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on the financial markets.
Only on Monday did the weak financial institutions get more than EUR 100 billion - he recalls the Viennan Der Standard, which seems more and more realistic the expectations that European taxpayers, like those in the United States, will have to put their hands on their portfolio to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not been very concerned about the crisis that has gone through the old continent as a tsunami.
The "saviours" must not immediately miss the 100 billion euros, however it would be better if they were to determine where it is appropriate to touch taxpayers' money to prevent major damage.
The intelligent machine imitates the flight of calabron
What might be the best way to develop anti-cancer technologies if you do not imitate the sensors of the obstacles that are in nature?
For example, those bees.
In the amazing project presented to the CEATEC in Japan, the calabrons gave the initial strategic tip to the engineers Nissan on how to build the next generation of anti-cancer systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotized miniauto with the properties of bees, with the aim of creating a system capable of scanning all collisions.
Flying the bees form their own oval personal space that really resembles our protective shield - explained to Kazuhiro Two, director of PR technology and research and development.
The role of the ape view is important, capable of a 300-degree view in each direction.
The engineers focused on the idea of telemetric laser to copy the function of the monkey view.
The BR23C detects the obstacles up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the monkey, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the incident.
This policy of avoiding, unlike the current system, is carried out in an instinctive manner.
"If it weren't for that, the robot car wouldn't react quickly to avoid collisions" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot auto project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the harmful and more internal layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a monkey does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in an eyeball.
But unlike the bees, the deviation cannot go up or down or in diagonal, it can only be bidimensional and in the direction of wheel steering.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow.
The BR23C is fed from batteries to lithium polymers, lighter and with high energy density, which means that their duration is higher than that of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction, not the processing of data, or even less the ability to store them, is important.
This robot must produce some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on the previous manoeuvre data, so it only uses a memory of a few decades of Kb.
There's no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, they foresee to Nissan, can be installed on serial vehicles within 10 years.
Further application options can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system which, by avoiding obstacles on the road, leads to destination.
They also found the name of the expensive child
The written version of the Economic Rescue Act of 700 billion dollars for the purchase of disproportionate appropriations has been drafted, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the sum is spent.
In the new protracted agreements until midnight, according to the time of the Eastern Coast, Congress leaders decided the 700 billion-dollar rescue plan after a debate that lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have done some serious steps forward - said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, that it is only left to put the agreement on paper.
Both candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
The Minister of Treasure Henry Paulson speaking of the result of the compromise said: the program will work and will be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street but about investing in the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 a.m. in Washington (the 2nd night of Monday in Central Europe), but it did not make a big increase in stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the draft Economic Stabilisation Act 2008 concerning the programme, then on to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and welcomed the news of the agreement with the White House.
We are pleased with the progress made tonight and we appreciate very much the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Frato spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which provided that the $700 billion would all have been spent on the purchase of securities with disproportionate credit to the back.
Now as a first step you will be able to spend up to half the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the Congress vote on Monday, with these the Ministry of Treasure will purchase securities with disproportionate amounts of credit, the kind of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will monitor the programme to which the President of the Federal Reserve also takes part.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Ministry can apply a combined tactic: it can buy at the same time credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits.
The purchase can take place through auctions and directly - they have announced the ministry's competent.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Treasury guarantees the means of concern for which companies will pay a price appropriate to the likely damage.
Henrz Paulson said that the law provides the necessary means for 700 billion dollars to come to the urgent needs of the American monetary system, which are about the purchase of wrong funds, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to make ourselves ready to introduce the law just signed - he added.
The heads of banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their well-being, defined by the ultra-ocean slang simply as gold paracads.
The limits of payments will only be limited in some cases, and the limits also depend on how the Ministry of the Treasury will offer assistance.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry acquires in the course of an auction, it will impose a surplus on the gold parachute, if they do not send the lost bank manager to retirement.
At the time of the direct purchase of the disproportionate appropriations, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the directors' money is not overrun.
In addition, the existing contracts of the gold parachute will not change, the limitation is only valid for the new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of general administrators - the democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives, commented on the provision.
In addition to this, the state has the right to adapt to a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can ultimately also profit if the economy, and together with the saved bank, will be restored on foot.
The proposal for a law includes that in the next five years the President must submit to Congress a proposal that has to be made to restore the expected losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, not to defend taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of California Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that the measures have been taken by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

As a result of the change in domestic prices and exports, industrial production costs were higher than 0.7% compared to the previous month and 3.2% compared to one year ago.
The prices of domestic industrial sales reported in the previous month only increased by 0.1%.
National sales prices in the manufacturing sector have also risen to a minimum of 0.1% compared to July.
The higher prices in August 2008 occurred in the field of leather and footwear processing (2.8%), especially bags and belts with 4.6% and the production of shoes with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price of plastic and chemical raw materials has led to a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the chemicals and products sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of instruments and electrical machinery (0.9%) and to a minimum extent in the wood processing (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, editorial and typographical activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the processing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In the supply of electricity, gas, steam and water, prices increased by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales in August, firstly as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the gas price made by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared to 12 months, considering domestic sales in the processing industry, the increase in the processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacture of metal products, the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in food, drink and tobacco production representing a determinant weight.
A decrease in prices occurred in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.3%).
In other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price increase varies from 0.6% to 9.1%.
Overall, in the manufacturing industry over the past year, prices rose by 10.2%.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector exceeded 18.7% of those in last year.
In national sales among target groups in the sectors, the highest monthly price increase occurred in August in the sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In sectors producing consumer goods prices have risen by 0.3%, in the energy and subsequent use sectors prices have not changed compared to those of the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, higher prices were observed in the energy and subsequent use sector (16.8%).
In sectors producing consumer goods, the increase was 6.8%, a decrease of 1.4% was measured for investment goods.
The prices of industrial export sales calculated in flowers increased by 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, compared to 12 months decreased by 3.9%.
The Hungarian flora in the course of a month has grown weaker than the euro of 1.7%, compared to the dollar of 7.1%, compared with August 2007 has increased by 7.5% compared to the euro and 15.9% compared to the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a vision?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around 12 January the US-Hungarian visa-exempt agreement may enter into force - the Foreign Minister has talked about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to her opinion, "now everything depends on the fact that the electronic input and control system is built in time".
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be permission to enter, but before leaving, tourists will have to register.
The Hungarian diplomatic officer will continue the negotiations in Washington from now on.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will deliver the medal of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and will hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also took a stand in favor of the bank's rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, guaranteed their support on Sunday at the $700 billion government plan to save banks, but there are politicians who claim resignations from the Minister of the Treasury.
The representatives of Congress and Administration after the marathon negotiations for days, on Sunday night, announced that they had concluded a principle agreement on the bank's rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to prove more suitable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys with the introduction of economic issues Obama has regained some advantage again, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican Convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin as Vice-President, has spread.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed the hope that the Congress would quickly approve the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contained those consumer protection steps that were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, the complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn't let himself get away from defining McCain's economic ideas.
McCain in an interview with the ABC explained that "all those who will send down with difficulty this situation (...) but doing nothing is not a road".
The Republican Senator reported that the proposal included the establishment of a monitoring committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outputs of the top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no merit in the agreements, instead he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill already Monday.
Press release of the German language world
The right pole is intact, only inside the pole voters have become more aware - thus Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The mirror (e.g. mirror.de)
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the German magazine on the left, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents analyzing the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known politician, the erosion of the CSU began a long time before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple came into charge.
The Christian-socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades, and right now these modern citizens are getting away from them.
At the same time, the change of time is a problem of all Christian democracy, so is Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday it was finished a process that was just ten years ago that was feasible: it ended the indisputable hegemony of a state party.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, CSU was hit 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 again in the period so mentioned Stoiber.
This is because modernization is carried out in a consistent way in the region, which devours parents.
The sociologists predicted it 40 years ago, but they made a lot of mistake. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of the Germans of the East and the North in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of the voters to the CSU.
Modernisation is going to be the same as increasing opportunities and the political consequences are evident.
The right pole is intact, only inside the pole the electors have become more aware, critical, self-esteemed.
It is also surprising that in the last few weeks the CSU has distanced itself from the classic bourgeois groups: free professionals, craftsmen, diplomats and graduates.
Here CSU support has dropped below 40%.
The Press (depresse.com)
The conservative daily came "Who With?" In the article "The Presidents of the Party are stuck in the questions of coalition" deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created following the elections.
The SPÖ intends to deal with the EIA.
The EPP prohibits the intervention of the SPO in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
Elections have been made, now all around the coalition; in the debate broadcast by the public TV, party leaders have just seen the cards.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to deal with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left the question open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the EVP, as vice chancellor.
As he said, the Schüssel-Multererer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Manyer has responded cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, collaboration would certainly not have happened if Faymann tried to enter the internal affairs of the EIA.
If his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition it is still an open matter in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the EIA.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ has repeated his opening in all directions.
"To prevent the Black-Red Coalition, we are ready to assume our responsibility to govern" - Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunity is launched in Paris, organised this year by France with the European Union's rotating presidency.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party, Fidesz, in the message addressed to the plenary as the main rapporteur of the Congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and to bring the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimir Špidla, responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, have opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights organisations within equal opportunities.
Mr Járóka, according to the press office of the Group of the European People's Party, recalled, in addition to discrimination in the assumptions, that the Roma are exacerbated by the labour market in the first place because of their low education.
"Most young Roma have no middle-level study title and as a result of elementary education of poor quality only an irresident number of them can reach a higher study title".
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in the enjoyment of human rights.
Investing in Roma children education can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make these links more widely known between the Roma and the non- Roma.
In fact, the first time the school starts a novel, the more opportunities it has to become a productive member of the labour market; the taxes paid for income and consumption contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European Roma citizenship must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" - Livia Járóka stressed.
According to the honourable Member, the European Union's objective and action must be to speed up the process of deregulation of schools and therefore it is essential that the existing anti-discrimination directives be properly complied with.
"The visible cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, and Roma children must be given the opportunities given by the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens full of the future of Europe" - Járóka asked.
As part of the European Year of Equal Opportunities to be guaranteed for all, the objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised each year, since last year's Berlin meeting, is to provide a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October you will decide the fate of the affected Huber-Beckstein couple.
Despite the bad electoral defeat the tests have not yet fallen, the discussion of personal issues at the top of the Bavarian CSU has been postponed for the time being.
The president of the Erwin Huber party and the regional governor Günther Beckstein are still in their place, the question is up to when mercy lasts.
Of the kind of tandem that has suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the party's extraordinary congress in the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticised politicians have found out in every case that they are not attacked with all the forces at the chair.
They have thus tried to soften the angry entrants of the parliamentary group and the basis that one day after the 'Babarian tsunamis' claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the guidance of Edmund Stoiber, then at the end of his career, the Christian-social union reached 60.7%, but now after the coup d'état against Stoiber, 43.4% fell.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria, which gives 18% of German GDP.
However, the Conservatives in the southern region of fundamental importance for the Hungarian economy will always be forced to cool down in the future.
As the first signal of the reorganisation within the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the restricted exploratory group that will start negotiations with the FDP liberals and with the Free Voters exhibiting right values for any government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of Liberi Electors, that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude towards Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity to strike by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat the woman with no regard for the great ambitions.
CSU leaders now concentrate all their forces to stabilize Beckstein somehow.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also have an active role to play in the shadow. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU defined on 28 September the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful to the CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to cancel after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU, which has played a decisive role in the national victory of 2005.
According to Merkel, who does not hide disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not adversely affect the great Berlin coalition.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the injured CSU, but the social democratic crisis is still hard.
The SPD has achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of the well-being and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is explained by the drafts made in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) hoped seriously that Lukashenko, with a renewed presidential mandate for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections, would "give" some seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus given up a previously assessed boycott.
In view of the opposition's expectations, Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, has asked for a credit to reduce the import of Russian natural gas increasingly expensive and has agreed to give the Russians the gas pipelines across the country through the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter for the Belarusian political situation considered anti-democratic.
It referred to a distance that the OSCE, in assessing the electoral campaign, placed emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on a third of the opposition's candidates.
However, the OSCE's rapid Monday report also criticised the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not actually appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, according to the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state, has been considering the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the 2006 presidential candidate for the opposition to the elections, it is desirable that it remains, despite the fact that "power has been afraid to have even one opponent in a Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not provide for protests for the results, but rather tries to get voters to deliver the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course, we have many problems, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, and for distribution local authorities are having difficulties, but I also see that more and more people support change, including among the elders - Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that neither the officially more assisted ceto, that of the pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime appropriate, which considers its main result to create social security.
Because of the country's indebtness and the increase in economic deficit, it is only a matter of time that the social security disaggregation "which remembers the grave silence" - thinks Milinkevich.
Contrary to the opposition policy, the Russian observers judged the elections democratically.
Sergej Lebedev, President of the Independent States Community, told the Russian press agency RIA News: "Men believe not in words but in fact", so the lack of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were turning doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from now on, he's taking this new step against the furbets, against those who seal and then he's gonna have a coffee at the bar in the working hours.
The anti-fannulloni novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The rotating doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for working better, with more productivity, more presence and more services" the minister says.
"Now there is a new season of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta says.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of turning doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance on the part of employees, the Secretary-General assures us: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all".
In other words, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and cornet.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning is a holy hand".
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the sickness allowance for public employees was reduced by 50%, that is 60 thousand more people at work in one year".
And it adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "the wage dynamics of which the minister has explained - in the last 8-10 years have been twice that of the private sector and well above inflation rates".
As many as thousands of public employees joined to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by acceding to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service is banning today numbers about the least absenteeism at work due to illness - it writes the consumer association - the people of the 'oppressive fans' are constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands of employees of the correct and productive public administration in Italy who have joined in declaring war against the illegal rules contained in the decree."
In particular, the Tar will challenge the exclusion of additional economic treatments for disease dependent on the cause of service; the extension of the hourly periods of reperitability of the sick worker, in which checks are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Cross prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur, 3 people die, and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inaill data confirm that white deaths have been around 1,200.
Figures that testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths compared to homicides.
To draw attention to institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all Italian provinces the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic chronics of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention of work is," says the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, the Mutilated and Invalid National Association of Labour, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "live appreciation for the constant association effort in favour of prevention at work, the protection of unhappily workers, the assistance of victims' families and the awareness of public opinion".
"Of course, there has been an angry 'suffering', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, for their size, arouse the media's slander and the involvement of the public opinion, but the daily reality offers us dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
In particular, they take the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness taken by young people who look at the world of work.
It is necessary to keep a close eye on the phenomenon, not to delay the alarm on its social gravity, to apply and improve legislation.
For his part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes upon all institutions a decisive commitment to put an end to them."
"Data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not take away the number of white deaths that is still impressive," noted the president of the Annel Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not want this "downside trend" to be translated into less attention, because it is just when attention is distracted that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at a general level there is still too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our opinion - it has stressed Mercandelli - to increase controls and inspections, but also to step up the training of workers, and this from the school world."
"It is a further effort - it has added - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, there is a greater sense of responsibility from employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then complained of "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation provided for the victims of work" and "the assistanceist derivative to which the system has been pushing in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the worker back the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who are unhappy should not depend on spontaneousism or enlargement at the same time as the legislator.
Mp3 readers in charge, risk hearing
Listening to high volume music for an extended period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission refers to, in a communication published in Brussels, it cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emergency and Recently Identified Health Risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than one hour per day holding the high-volume device risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and cell phones at high sound levels can unwittingly damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific findings - continued by responsible Ue - present a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts most is that we must raise awareness of consumers and make this public domain information.
We also need to review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to ensure that they are fully effective and step-by-step with new technology."
Brussels had asked the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - concluded by Executive Ue - confirm that there is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and stakeholders what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar equipment."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage may arise from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage very much by using solutions such as reduction of levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the Ue Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical equipment if they listen to music at high volume (over 89 decibels) for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limits for the maximum noise allowed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would involve 5-10% of the users of these devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the sums will be taken.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the combatants are closed in March, the Board and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official ballot" of Campidoglio and its mayor Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are all the political, social and cultural ideas - it would like to emphasise Germany - it will have to provide proposals for an idea of development in Rome, of which political decision makers, who remain the Joint and the Council, will then be able to take action.
There is no overlap of roles but only the desire to have a place where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March it will finish its work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Germany repeats: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If there will be quality, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
It is too often that politics is shifting from the management of the newspaper to the emergencies that are once again taking place.
On the contrary, we want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, seriously working on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome is keen to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless institution nor a carriage zone: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences expressed by the Capital".
For Germany, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immovable, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which it absolutely needs, thinking with unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome "will not be limited to the present municipal boundaries but will look well beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but also "in view of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants us to be independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
The attacks against Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
She wrote to a Miami lady on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stubborn face: he thinks he will win the highest position of a nation he has had in all two governors and five black senators!".
They are actually attacks that don't say much; they are clearly attacks of a racial nature and do not respond to the question of voters: will it be a good president? Then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with a good distance.
Even in this case, there are those who talk to the heart but not to the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the South of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the poll room we know well who will give his vote to the American patriot.
It emerges from a side of the U.S. mentality kept covered until the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll think about where to put the crochet, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama should win, we'll leave America.
What has never been said before, which seems almost certainly the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasons, the winning weapon for the democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89% answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home to football.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives, and the Americans have not been forced to make their bags.
Yet, Iraq for the most part was Bush's weak point.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to do.
Use, economic fraud can also be felt on journalists: in the newspapers it is time to cut. And many blame the Internet, "killer" of the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, cuttings in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as the big public intends to do, to be substantially affected.
A clear but complex pessimism is going through today by the U.S. journalist.
You are on ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that journalism at national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The biggest editing houses open a gap to the Internet, for many views such as the "killer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" reported by journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it "makes something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap today in American journalism is among those who run the newsrooms - i.e. the directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage is down to 23%.
For some, this has to do with "security of work".
Executives who think they're losing their job around 3 years are 47% at the national level.
For the reporters' staff, it's 30%.
That of "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a vast nation such as Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it", take or leave it.
The directors receive almost always high salaries, while the editor can also earn $10,000 a month, as well as pension and insurance payments.
For the holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third to arrive at 15 complete days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: THE COURT OF ROMANIA, DANILO COPPOLA A LIMITED TO GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudou, decided to reject the claim of the realist Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the Unipol-Bnl scale counterattack.
In the course of the process at its post last week, he obtained the removal from the households transformed into an obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the realist could travel from the city of the province to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (which he gave the contrary opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access to the evidence that he was accused of.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already emerged some days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the 700 billion-dollar rescue plan from the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times confirms yesterday by informing us that the current crisis is crushing the Republican Party, increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, especially strong in the Central and South States.
The soul, for the sake of which, it was made quite alive by the vote I said at the outset.
However, this is just an example of the changes, of the major changes, that the current economic earthquake may predetermine or even disappear: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps even here.
Both in use and in Europe the crisis seems to be an acceleration of phenomena in incubation for a long time and in the new climate solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these is the renewal, the extraordinary relaunch, of the dual category of state sovereignty in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which have, in fact, made links with the outside world, but which first and foremost involve very large numbers of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
What immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In other words, the crisis appears economically global but politically is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of play or not to have much to say: the European Union has given the lamp test that divides as usual between the various interests and between the various state strategies is unable to decide any common policy line.
And so it is from the government of every single State that all are expected to take action, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and, above all, funding: since when you get to the narrow ones, only the States that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that are able to try to put things back into six.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which no market and no international organisation will possibly ever have the same.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the static-national element is still in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a very closely linked factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had already entered the kingdom of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of material, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we agreed with a section that our future would have to make the accounts on a growing scale with those very little material things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look a little bit, can certainly be transported from one place to another on the earth, but they are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
As for those who are to be sovereign, he certainly owns several more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that predicts a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and so Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for self-reliance, the request of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species, has been so inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And together something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: a discredit, an indifferentness, an image of inadequacies, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
It seems to be becoming more and more road, in vast areas of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, having made their time and being increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in other words, feeds underground a branched but able movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political essays, which is manifested in the sudden "revolving" electoral or sudden developments in the collective moods of these last and final times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavier to the collapse of the Labourist Consensus in Britain, the rebellion of the American congresses against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do).
It is the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and thus to represent, what is not taking shape today in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is invigorating, increasing, potentially moving.
In view of all this, it would be exaggerating to say about a 'rebellion of the masses' on the agenda.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not for nothing.
The Overcrowd to Walk Over the Wall
Conquering the laws of gravity thanks to a super collar and in the future walking on walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of various American research centres and now a team of four institutions has gone very close to us.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, the students were able to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of those who use a particular structure of carbon, called nanotubes of carbon.
"The principle of the colla can be imagined as a series of tubes that are arranged as a pile of spaghetti" explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the gecko’s legs, covered by microscopic skin that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these rectangles and at the same time "is easily removed from the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton University of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are drivers of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
No superheroes for now.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, in California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented a microfibre-shaped adhesive as hair that self-cleanses from dust during the movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adherence.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit juice
Attention to the pumping juice, to the orange and apple juice.
These drinks, especially in summer, are consumed because tens of people and rich in vitamins, if they take some life-saving drugs simultaneously alter their absorption by amplifying or reducing their effectiveness, as appropriate, with serious health consequences.
To reiterate the risks of fruit juices both packed and fresh associated with the taking of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, that since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in the course of Philadelphia launches a new alarm: enough a glass of pumping, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some medicines saved, canceling the benefits and endangering the health of patients.
The pumping juice was already over indicted because it was considered responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotics, angiolytics, antistatics and neurologicals up to the levels considered toxic.
RISCH pharmacies - The same Italian Medicines Agency had reported this in a newsletter two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the risk of this mix and to be careful about what to drink in the case of taking medicines such as Diazepam or methadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active principles inhibited by pump and other juices.
The call from Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These findings are usually reported immediately to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies that may provide for changing the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear, do not make us impress but ask for clarifications to the doctor or pharmacist” the expert emphasized to Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for the Economy was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron was missing, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published on the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that has been launched not a few controversial ones and that has been refocused on the economist for years, but that has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as Enron or Worldcom's collapse disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a publisher with a "very aggressive, particularly critical style against the excessive freedom of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here's the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source of personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most well-known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year by voluntary developers, whose back is monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the large audience with various new features: the welcome screen and the magazine interface and less bursting, adding other essential ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention is also paid to interoperability with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as what allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for e-mailing them, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphic processing module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create "PDF hybrids" documents that accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
The collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with more hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the text processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English one that was on the mirror since Friday.
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can also send the installation CD at home or at work.
And if the theme of the free can be a training for spreading in the homes, it is precisely in business that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, having already been able to count on various projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And not even the realities that offer an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the Emulsion presentations of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The 2008 goal is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are today at almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the output of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected number.
Even Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positiveness to the last Tour de France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, third grader and winner of the best climber shirt.
To report the news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26th year of Kohl is the fourth positive runner to Cera, the third generation Epoch, after the Italians Ricardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples is one of those conducted in the last weeks by the laboratories in Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counteranalysis confirms the positiveness in Cera, Austria will lose third place in the Tour and will meet two years of canonical qualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positive in the third generation is the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordy, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the positive to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian was placed on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also awarded the shirt to the best climber.
IMPORTANT: NEW YORK TIMES ARE YOU GONNA GO, IS ITALIA IS RESIDENT?
Italy "from the country of immigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" accepted with rebuttal.
Is this turning Belpaese into a racist nation? Is it what you are asking in a long article the New York Times that devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a cookie box.
This case highlights what Nyt defines as the "north paradise": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" is recorded but also the "highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support to the North League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation, which is intended by the Lega, which restricts immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines, is also cited as a paradigm for climate change in Italy.
The trend was highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Student victims of car rentals up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students is not in crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the union of tenants, taking a single room can cost up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious character to exclude whole sections of young people from the right to study for the highest total costs that families of origin should support - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of generalized increase has also been introduced for residents."
In most cases, rental offers include a number of violations: free, unregistered, canoe-free, sub-rents linked.
For the Sun, there is a need for extraordinary measures which, through the revision of the tax system, can alleviate prices.
Looking at the details of the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed place in the Brianza area, there are about 450 euros; for a single room there is a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) at an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) at a maximum of 900 (in the Victoria area).
In Florence a bed place costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students focus on areas near the University, there are 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome areas near central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It only saves if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed place and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples there are 300/450 euros for a bed, one room spends from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas of Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
At Bari there are 250/350 euros for a single bed place, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where rents to non-Community students are more frequent, such as Perugia, there is at last an additional anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradise, the cities cancel the historical halls
The historical cinematographic halls close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic hall is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographes what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the great multisals and the consequent death of monosals in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem inextricable and incontrovertible to us but also has all the characteristics of a real and own cultural crime.
Often disappearing are historical places and memory loads," it is as if a friend, a acquaintance with whom we have shared a piece of road and many emotions," observes the director of New Paradise Cinema, the film that twenty years ago the Oscar Prize and the Grand Prize of the jury of Cannes, and that recounted the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way to live the movie lost perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of the practitioners, are clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed down, and to pay the largest bulkhead are the halls in the main cities: 10 in less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the primary closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost monosala cinema, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible of their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multi-room cinemas: 195 more and more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exercise has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures but should ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a closed city hall, not all its members are willing to move into multiplex.
In order not to mention the lack of funding in favour of the operators: the state's early debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector would be between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million per year."
Interestingly, in the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about closures, decided to make repairs with the signature of a protocol between Comune and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote monosala cinemas both in the historical center and in the periphery.
The rules include tax relief measures in favour of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and have special tariffs for the stop and in some parking lots.
“It’s an initiative that I like” observes Giuseppe Tornator, and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting other measures in place.
It is true, however, that in order to counter multiplex strands, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today the public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bavaria SuperCinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Paradise cinema", which I have been thinking of for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto or Quirinale by National Via now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the cartels blown away by dust I turn around from the other side».
Links between politics and the arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to harmonise the choices of the municipality in the interests of the Pyromalli shell".
The accusations are heavy that the magistrates of the Antimony Directorate of Calabria address the mayor and the vice-sindicate of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for outside competition in mafias association.
In mannets too Joacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his lawyer's grandson, the boss's omony, already convicted of association for criminalizing Mafio stamps, condemned to raise EUR 10 million.
"In disregard of any legal and moral norms, as well as of good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their desire to pay counsel to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been so granted to the cosca - the judges write - to enter officially within the municipalities facilitating the possibilities, already large, of control and address of the public administration."
The president of the Agazio Loiero regional council in Calabre does not hide that "collusions between local and evil institutions are organized" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of the Andrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
This morning's arrests follow those of the last July with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Pyromalli shell.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged conditions between organised crime and local administration, local politicians had been raised by the task of administering the Commune.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Udc's mayor at the time of the dissolution, was elected head of a central right coalition after the May 2006 dance.
He yelled at the scandal when Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the council.
He called in question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architectured everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the order of arrest signed this morning, explained that the Pyromalli cosca had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torreone, they write the pm, "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a wider group known to be close to the Pyromas, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the shell".
When the energy comes from the waves now the big ones descend into the field
It is an over-compensation, which covers more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the major world energy companies.
Where, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they put their eyes, and now they try to put their hands, colloquially like Chevron.
The possibility of generating energy from the sea's movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now environmentalists and the new increase in oil are driving the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by offshore windmills.
This quantity would be twice that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be currents and tides.
Colosseums on attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are more and more and between these companies are always voting on traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies - he has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the US oil spill to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining permission from the United States Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a signal not recently, especially if it is considered that in Alaska the Uses continue to extract oil and President Bush has recently launched a plan for new trevelations.
In addition to Chevron there is the Verdan Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the energy road that comes from the sea and the amounts invested so far, as not noted in the details, indicate to the observers an interest in excess.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are still talking about a technology at dawn, even because marine energy does not escape all the doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems in the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies must be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good connected between them.
The pressure of the waves, which moves the oxen up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders within the swimmers.
Pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now there are four such installations in the design process, waiting for only federal approval and part of energy could serve as a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are the seas makes the poles of the turbines spin, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permits to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, is now worth the potential of the seas.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely about the energy of the seas that were like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others who are looking at the cost, they already invested $7 million in 2008 and projected investments up to 35 million for 2009.
