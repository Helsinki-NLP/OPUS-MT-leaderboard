In my view, the literature programme was formed by women of the Balzakov age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred the Danish and the Volconian.
Of course, they have written a bulletin about the same women of Balzakov’s age.
And the psychology and torture of the heroes of Tolsto and Turgenev for adolescents is not so interesting.
I'm growing up in a very rare, interesting psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Germany: The Fourth Influenza of the Crown Virus Unavoidable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or the autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final but will continue with the new force.
Despite an active adjuvant campaign in Germany, no two or three doses of crown virus vaccine will probably not be sufficient for full protection.
The leader of the Association of Doctors of General Practice Ulrich Weygeldt is convinced of this.
This is what Die Welt reports on Saturday, 11 December.
"We expect the fourth vaccination to be required in the summer, the autumn at the latest," says the expert.
In addition, Wiegeldt hopes that the fourth vaccine from the crown virus can be carried out “in combination with influenza vaccination”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help to combat the spread of the new strain of the micron.
The new option is particularly dangerous.
So, the probability of re-infection of Omicron three times higher than in Delta or Beta strains.
This is demonstrated by the results of the preliminary study conducted in the UAR.
Based on this, BioNTech / Pfizer manufacturers are planning to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
The companies stress that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new version of the crown virus, Omicron.
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that the efficacy of two doses of the vaccine is significantly below: “the neutralizing potential is reduced more than 25 times”.
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against micronectal infection," stressed BioNTech and Pfizer.
A third dose is therefore required.
Experts insist on speeding up vaccination in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society of Infections Bernd Zalzberger advocates a reduction in the interval between the second and third seizures.
As Zalzberger believes, the accelerated vaccination will have an impact on both the delta virus and the micron variant of the crown virus.
"The experience of Israel is very convincing," the expert stressed.
Vobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 years old.
Bet-A-Vib series is a special Bet-A family line from Pontoon21®.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) is different from many other outbreaks because it was originally created with a view to the use of underfishing, not only for fishing.
These outbreaks are greater than those near the annals, which certainly have a positive impact on the nuances of the use of these interesting prawns.
Another feature known is the upper surface of a durable and immediate plastic plate, which creates additional vibration detonations at vertical and horizontal lines.
As a "winter bitch" in the Bet-A-Vib trap shows a pretty aggressive game.
Often the most catch is a simple monotonous animation, i.e., the up-down factor movement almost without a break.
When planning a deviation from the vertical axis, it is not very large, which is convenient to catch in a limited area that is blocked by underwater vegetation, corals and other obstacles that may be blocked.
In addition, there is a slight deviation in the winter catch of the turtle and the big shark, and especially in the middle of the winter, when accurate and aggressive baiting is required.
After reaching the end of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib is instantly devolved and returned to the baseline.
At least Bet-A-Vib has been successfully applied to the winter forage.
To match her caprism, you can choose from two modifications: with or without the sound capsule (NS-NanoSound) (SL-Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to irritate a passive horn that does not even react to live.
The Bet-A-Vib capture shows the distance and accuracy.
This fiber is understood and not capricious, well combined with forest and plaited wires, even with large diameters.
For the catch, there was no hooks, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia, nos, nostalgia, nos, nostalgia, nos, nostalgia, nostalgia, nos, nos, nos, no
If you're fishing in the cornered areas, you can change the front triangle into a double, which will reduce the probability of a collision.
One of the most sustainable of the Bet-A-Vib class and, as a result, one of the most catchable.
With the same success, it can be used on relatively small and fairly deep areas.

7 thousand Russian mercenaries reported in Libya
In Libya there are more than 7,000 employees of the private military company (CHV) Wagner.
This was stated on Thursday, 12 December, by the President of the High Council of the Republic of Khaled al-Mishri.
"There are now more than 7,000 Wagoners in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also run trances in Sirte and Cuffre.
They have 30 reactive aircraft at Gardabia's aviation bases (also used as a civil airport in Sirta), " says the Anadolu Agency.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to capture" the central part of Libya, extending from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
_Other Organiser
According to the co-chair, Moscow sought a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “situated in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufre, is noted in the Agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner CWC has been supported by Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner is allegedly active in nine African countries -- the CAR, Libya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Vagnera ' s subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licences for the use of useful mined and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to those countries," the article states.
According to the media, the Wagners claimed to have fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the PRC.
This group is neither in the force agencies nor in the legal register, and its fighters are not in the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
In the past, 27 EU countries had previously approved restrictions against Wagner.
This decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of Libya de facto is the second Chamber of Parliament with consultative functions with the dominant Islamists in it, TASS writes.
The body has repeatedly called for the transfer of one day ' s vote on the elections of parliamentarians and heads of State from 24 December to at least February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances that they will pass quickly are reduced," notes the paper.
In this regard, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period of time, reports Sky News Arabia ' s TV channel.
Foreign policy with Russian eyes
38 per cent of Russians see more success than failure in their foreign policies, and 29 per cent believe that failure is prevalent.
"Successful Examples - "Protected in Syria, restored peace there," "Decision on the North Stream-2", "The whole world feared that the cool weapon," "The Crime We Despised".
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “peace isolation”,” are said in a study of the Public Opinion Fund.
The Dubai Government has completely rejected paper production - all servicers have also become digital only
The Government of Dubai reported a complete rejection of paper production and the transition to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively by electronic means.
This is reported by the WAM Emeritus Information Agency.
"Today marked the beginning of a new phase of the digitization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said the successor prince of the Emirat, President of the Dubai Executive Board, Sheikh Hamdan Ben Mohammed Ben Rashid Al McCtum.
The internal and external document exchange in all Dubain agencies will now only be carried out in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected everything without exception: health, CCC, police, municipal authorities, courts and so on. Many commercial structures have also joined the Government ' s initiative.
The transition to the electronic government and the digitization of the document has begun in Dubai since 2018.
At the time, according to the authorities, 336 million paper sheets were saved, representing 14 million hours of human work and $353.8 million in cash.
Former Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobianin said that electronic services would save citizens 2 days a year.

The production and export of Turkish cars fell below the level of 2020
The production and export of Turkish cars fell sharply in November in the background of the lira.
As a result of the 11-month industry performance, it was worse last year, according to Bloomberg, referring to data from the Turkish Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
According to the association, in November Turkey, 115 thousand cars were released, 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
Approximately 75.9 thousand cars were exported, with more than 25 per cent of the last year's output.
And if, as a result of the first 10 months of this year, Turkey ' s car sector has demonstrated a positive trend by last year, the result of 11 months 2021 was already 0.3 per cent worse than last year ' s.
As a result of such a fall, the Turkish lira was severely reduced to 29 per cent compared with the dollar in November.
This has led to a fall in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 ICB entities received a 2021 delay on credit payments
The first Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, reported on the situation of granting benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, handed over to the IIA correspondent, Kasinform.
“For the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the regulation and development of the financial market, this year, in accordance with the mandate of the Head of State of 1 April 2021, the President of the Agency of 9 April 2021 adopted the Order No. 127 “Prohibition for the deferral of payments by small and medium-sized business entities”, wrote Alihan Smailov in his reply to the parliamentary inquiry.
He recalled that the arrangement for the deferral of loans provided for the provision of loans by banks and micro-financial entities, the deferral of loans issued before 1 April 2021 to ICB entities, including IPs, from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The delay was between 30 and 90 days for the selection of the ISB.
The borrower's statement could specify another time limit for deferral of payments.
During the delay with the borrower, the claim work was suspended, the notification of the need to settle the overdue and the receipt by the creditor of commissions and other payments," the premier noted.
In 2021, second-level banks received late payments from 603 ISB borrowers, of which 553 ISB entities were deferred at 9.7 billion.
IFO submitted applications for a deferral of 131 ISB entities, of which 95 were granted a deferral of 105.8 million tons," A. Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Purassev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the strain "ommiron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can carry it more easily than those with a strong protective response.
Pulmonologist Sergey Purassev explained why the strain of the crown virus "ommiron" could be dangerous.
The cause should be sought in the context of the birth of the virus.
Scientists believe that ochmiron was born in a body infected with HIV or with immunodeficiency.
I mean, he didn't find any resistance to immunity during his mutation.
That makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no response from immunity, he got very fast.
Looks like he's got these pop-labels, chips, maybe more than he's got, their antibodies didn't cut during mutations, says Puller Sergey Purassev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can carry "ommiron" more easily than those with a strong protective response.
It turns out the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, isn't always good.
In such cases, the body may kill itself.
That's what happens when you're a 30-year-old and you're a 60-year-old.
The immune response of a young man is completely inadequate: where only a finger could be threatened, he beats like an arrow on the crows, shut up by Sergey Purássev.
The doctor also recalled that the crown virus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case only symptoms - all hope for the body can often be bought.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the intoxication of the body, which is temperature, weakness, inability.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, throat injury, cough.
Right or left pain, abdominal pain may also be evidence of a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, by the end of the year, a growing generation from 12 to 18 years of age may begin to be vaccinated.
The virusologist, head of the laboratory of the GMITI engineering, Pavel Volczkov, noted that this category is very active in the skin.
For adolescents who attend school, the number of contacts is maximum.
It's the most socially active proselytist, as did children's garden educators, said "Mosque 24" Pavel Volczkov, a virologist, head of the laboratory of the IMF genomic engineering.
I am most grateful to the author for this article.

Immunologists have suggested why people with obesity become victims of cholera
The authors studied the fatty tissue left behind from bariatric operations and found that fatty cells known as adipocytes could be infected with coronary virus.
The immune cells in the fat tissue, macrophages, were also infected, showing a strong inflammatory reaction.
Researchers have also studied the fatty tissue of patients who died of cholera and found particles of coronal virus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can be hidden in fat tissue using it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid immune response.
Probably capable of that, too, SARS-CoV-2.
The biologist described the causes of dementia
The candidate for biological science, Semen Golosheikin, called the causes of dementia and described how it is being prevented in the Sputnik radio interview.
According to WHO, over 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is a gradual loss of cognitive functions, and in time, a person with difficulty is guided even in a familiar environment.
Volosheikin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerative disorders, head injury, some infections, metabolic disorders and the lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
These include hypertension, diabetes, increased cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the level of conduct, the role of social isolation and the lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorder and low-removal lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and decrease the level of abstract thinking.
"The discussion is that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risks of its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the outbreak of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the required level of physical loading, training cognitive skills and capabilities that require memory and logic involvement.

N.I. Pirogova, head of the cognitive disorder department of the Federal Brain Center and Neurotechnology Anna Bogolepova, told of the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30,000 illegally expelled from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return to its family about 30,000 artifacts that have been illegally smuggled out of the country.
On Saturday, 11 December, Al-Hayat, Chief Inspector of the Department of Returning Ancients of the Ministry of Tourism and Ancients of Egypt, reported.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has been able to return 29,300 artifacts.
Only this year at the Bible Museum in Washington were 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization found," he said.
Abdel Wayad made it clear that all smuggled by means of artifacts were recorded in archives.
Departmental staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts are “following auctions around the world and selling on the Internet” through foreign and Egyptian sites and social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that cultural values were restored and then displayed in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts became an ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities requested Interpol to help find the auctioned by Pharaoh Tutanhumon.
The Christie's auction house held auctions on 4 July at which the bus was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles) over 3,000 years old.
This caused Egypt’s discontent.
The Egyptian side also claims that the object of art was taken illegally from the Karnak Temple in the 1970s in Luxor.
The head of Tutanhimon, pictured by the sun god Amon, has been stored in a private collection and has not been on the market since 1985.
The way the relic came into Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking to repatriate illegally expelled from the country at various times of ancient memory.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of smuggled ancients are the result of archaeological research by black miners.
"No account is taken of Crimea Tatars" - and that is correct, since Crimea Tatars (232 thousand) are a separate people (close to the Turks).

FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its staff to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, says the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communications to its staff, instead offering a discount on the acquisition of a mobile phone or smartphone by a telecommunications operator.
Under the current rules, the bank may view information on corporate devices issued to its staff as they are used to deal with business issues with colleagues or clients.
The Bank enjoys the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases, for example, if it has been used by a staff member to meet with a client who has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved to a remote working system, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to deal with labour issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline for staff to meet the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenina's life, 1925, was fruitful in terms of creativity, but more difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He's already out of any literary associations, he's drifting around with imagination, he's on his own, but he's known, he's cut, he's been severely criticized at times, even bad, but the reader's audience is ready to wear it on his hands.
Over 60 poems were written a year ago, many of them -- these are the masterpieces -- completed the cycle of the Persian Motivations, written by Anna Snowin, published by 8 books, compiled by Russian Soviets.
And the main success was at the end of June 25th, the Gossydt concluded a contract with the Essenian to publish its compositions in 3 volumes.
None of Sergei Alexanderovich's modern poets have earned such honor, he's the first!
This also resulted in very good money - the fee was 1,000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, 300 rubles per month, engineer 200).
The funds were needed that year as never before.
Essenin married Lviv Tolstos Tolstos Tolstos, had to establish a family home, had to contain Sister Kathu and Sasha, as well as mother.
Life would have been like something to rejoice for him, but for him everything was decorated mainly in dark tones, as if a nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Essen):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Does the wind blow?
On an empty field and on an empty field.
It's like a plant in September.
He's sleeping in the brains of alcohol.
Many well - known people have noted that Essenin has given up very much, seems ill, apparently ill.
There are more and more rumors, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis is alcoholism, Sergey Alexandrovich has been put to the test, there are no reliable documents.
For example, regarding May 1923, when Essenin insisted on a fourth wife, the American Aisedora Duncan restored health at a clinic in Paris with Professor Petr Gannuškin (he will be back to Essenin two years later, already in Moscow).
And here is the evidence of the poet's exploits, the scandals on the ground, the reasons for the police are enough, scattered by dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 20th century, the fearsome novel of a poet with a green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Essenin settled for a short time with a friend named Ivan Starzov.
Amazingly, though, Esena never had her own home in Moscow or in Peter’s home when he had very poor income.
The old man remembers:
"He came only at night, and in most cases in an unchanging, drunken state.
Once back at four o'clock in the morning, Essenine fell on the stairs...
When he fell, he scratched his face and yelled.
When he comes in for a little while, he starts to chew all the blood he's had..."
Yes, even after the war on Europe and the United States (in the United States there was a dry law, but Duncan accepted a similar supply of alcohol):
"I didn't see anything there, except the cabacas and the streets...
I've been through and people have stopped remembering...
Well, and drinking, of course...
And I drank because the bag was bitten."

Mid-Polish believes that Belarus uses migrants as "arms" against the EU
Mid-Polish believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms”
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland Pavel Yablonsky expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, used refugees as "arms" against the European Union and intended to return to such "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement of the MIDI lock was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Appleny, sanctions against Belarus were temporarily “set aside by Lukashenko”, but he “is actively seeking new ways”.
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
As Kp.ru wrote, the European Union had previously introduced a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He spoke to 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, there was a willingness to continue to expand restrictive measures against the Republic “if the situation in the country does not improve”.
Minsk responded by introducing a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by the Shadow Hat": when a bartender pizza makes a man's smile
In the 2021 world events, bartender pyjamas were dominated.
Please, the first one who said about his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
In September, he appeared at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die" in a bartender pijjak and a traditional "Bondove" grandmother.
Following his example, Prince William, who first attended the award ceremony for The Earthshot Prize, which did not comply with the royal dress code, followed a green bartender pijjak, and then chose a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A few weeks ago, the trend was exemplified by Lionel Messia.
The football player came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in the dolce & Gabbana bartage.
His sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress has already noted a growing demand for bartender men's pyjamas in Russia.
According to the service analysts who came to the "Ru.", they were bought in 1.4 times more.
The most popular hot bartender pyjamas with floor and silhouette, the main colors are dark-flight, board, dark- blue and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is between 3 and 6 thousand rubles, while men prefer to buy exclusively pajamas - sets of bartender costumes they choose to cut.
You can buy them not only for online retellers.
Budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
The luxury pajamas from the bar at this season are presented in almost all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model in which he went to one of the Prime Minister of the Dom Gucci film, Ambassador Jared Leto.
By choosing the Pijaki expensive brands, you can be sure that the barhat is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of cross-fertilization, we obtain a thick fabric with a weaving outer texture and smooth interior.
More budget options are made from a boy or a polyamide, but are therefore less useful.
Modern expert Lamoda Ilia Wahoškin warns that in the case of a barchatter, the main thing is not its model or its pheasant, but its suitability.
"Barhat requires the evening light, so this pizza is ideal if you come together for a party or a party," explains Wahoškin.
Another important criterion that allows for a choice for a bartender is the status of his buyer.
"A man in a bartender's pajamas, first of all, must take care of the right forwarded towel with enough, - the authors of the Telegram channel consider the male fashion "Krasavčik Brammell." - The owners of the bartender's pajamas usually belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to the glorious world events, where the dress code is always given.
Ilia Wahoškin offers to combine the pizza from the barchatt with the same items: classic bunnies with shorts, uniform skirts, shelves, walnuts with walnuts, walnuts.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Modern experts from Krasavčica Brammella are convinced that it would be inappropriate to appear in a row servant's bartage at the corporation, and that is what "the manager of those who run this event is "yes" to him.
If the employee is below and his goal is to move higher in the company's complex hierarchy or to blow off the financial bonuses, it is better not to put up a bartender.
The guide accurately evaluates this with the phrase "not on the Shadow Hat" - the editors of the Telegram-channel view it as a male fashion.

Immunologist said that 4-5 months of revaccination would help protect against the strain of the crown virus “micron”
Revaccination after four to five months can protect against the new strain of coronary infection “micron”.
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Krückov, who called the visit six months later, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, “a long period”
"In the past, this was a normal time, but now it was best to conduct the procedure five months later, and people with chronic diseases four years later," said the expert, calling in parallel with the usual campaign, to undertake revaccination.
Kreuchkov also noted that early revaccination provided a good title for neutralizing antibodies.
"If a man made two eyelids and a booster, or he got over and vaccinated, or he got vaccinated and over, he got "hybrid immunity," that is, the antitype of many and neutralizing enough," said the expert.
"The Great Seven" warned Russia of the "mass-scale consequences" in the event of an invasion into Ukraine
The Big Seven countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement on the outcome of the mid-term summit in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia ' s “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have enormous consequences and will be expensive” in Moscow, but no specific measures are described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russian military power and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," says the statement.
Ministers further call on Russia to “weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations with regard to the transparency of military activities”, said President Byden during a video call to President RF Putin on 7 December.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the normative format to achieve full implementation of the Mining Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the Foreign Ministers of the Great Seven also say.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have a huge impact and a serious price in response," they warn.
We reaffirm our firm commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's holding position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our overall and comprehensive response," said the statement.
Earlier this day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Trass, said that Russia would suffer “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
She said that this meeting showed “one voice of the Great Seven” countries, which accounted for 50 per cent of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion in Ukraine would have a huge impact on Russia.”
The Pfizer vaccine is 32 times less effective than micro-stamp
The efficacy of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against coronal micronxamma is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
This was the conclusion of scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of Hong Kong of China, transmitted by South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity in subjects receiving two doses of COVID-19.
"We see that most people have had a high level of anti-virus activity against the Sars-CoV-2 option, but this capacity has been significantly reduced against micro-divisibility," said Professor Malik Pearice.
However, scientists have stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the serious flow of the disease in case of coronal virus infection.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of a coronary pandemic, taking into account its impact on the micro-stamp.
The authors of the study concluded that the micro-stamp could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality unless additional measures were taken.
Ukraine ' s Head of Minor Defence Indicted the FWG to Block NATO Weapons in Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of former FRG Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition of lethal weapons by Kiev under NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany had put a vote on Ukraine ' s procurement of anti-Sniper systems and rifles to defeat unmanned pilots.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened its position with regard to rifles, recognizing them as immortal weapons.
Upon approval by the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons under bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, it is the United States, Britain, Lithuania and France.
FT notes, however, that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholtz on the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Friday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany, Andrei Melnik, expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to deliver weapons to the Chancellor of Scholtz.
He said that the previous FWG leadership had explained its refusal to provide weapons with the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the “occupation of Russia” in the Ukrainian territory.
The same "unlogical" position as a certain diplomat, Germany will remain with the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenski said that Kiev was expecting assistance from Berlin in the maritime fleet.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany will “be a technical partner of Ukraine”, the president added.
It was also noted that during the spring of the current year, the Co-Chairman of the Greens Party of the FWG Robert Habek visited the Republic where he was selling defence weapons to Kiev.

"Messedes" protested the results of Gran-pri Abu-Dabi
The German Mercedes team, whose pilot Luis Hamilton at Gran Pri Abud-Dabi finished the second chase after the Red Bull chase by Max Ferstappen, protested the outcome of the race, reported the Formula-1 press service.
Mercedes believes that the driving was in violation of the Formula-1 rules 48.12 and 48.8.
In the first case, the German team contested the decision of the judges to return to the round racers in one round with the leaders.
According to the second, Ferstappen crossed Hamilton to the authorized "start" zone.
Let's add that now the outcome of the Abu-Dabi Grand Prix that Ferstappen beat Hamilton for 2.256 seconds and won the Formula-1 World Championship is preliminary when the Mercedes protests are not known
G7 warned Russia of responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine
Foreign Ministers of the G7 warned of the “serious consequences” for Russia if it continued military aggression against Ukraine, as stated in the party ' s final statement.
The meeting also noted that the Russian armed forces were condemning the strengthening of the country ' s borders.
" Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have serious consequences and serious costs," says a statement published on the UK Government website.
The G7 and the EU High Representative noted that “one in their condemnation of Russian armed forces and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine”.
The head of the British media, Elizabeth Trass, warned of the "great consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to give up aggression against Ukraine," she said.
Earlier at the Liverpool Summit, Foreign Ministers of the G7 agreed that the Russian troops on the border with Ukraine should be returned to the negotiating table to resolve the crisis.
It was about negotiations in "Norman" format.
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke for dialogue on Ukraine in "Norman" format.
The representative of the Russian MIDI, Maria Zaharova, said that, calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries “were unable to take responsibility for their own mistakes”.

Discovered ways to return stolen via the Internet money store
There are several ways to return money stolen through the Internet store and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were discovered by information security experts in consultation with the RBK.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of major losses when data on a bank card fall into the hands of abusers, it is recommended to store basic funds on a card or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
Part of the stockpiles may be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as necessary.
Experts also recommend establishing a separate map for online purchases.
If money has been stolen in stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, a return procedure can be initiated.
“In the framework of the rules established by payment systems on unauthorized transactions without 3D Secure, responsibility is placed on the participant in a series of calculations that does not use this service”, said the representative of Promswäzbank.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecompay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer had the right to lodge a complaint with the bank no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if a criminal has used a map on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be processed and returned.
It is noted that in some cases Internet stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent in.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Ekaterin Mizulin’s Safe Internet League, reported that only in 2021, 11,000 treatments had been received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
In her view, an effective solution under current circumstances could be the establishment of a single window for complaints against online engineers.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss the North Stream-2 and EU legislation
Germany's newly elected Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for negotiations on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the increase of Russian troops at Ukraine's borders, and the situation with the Russian pipeline "North Stream-2".
Although Scholtz had expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of two countries expressed unmistakable expectations of each other.
Prime Minister Mateus Moravecky of Poland stated that he would call on the Scholtz to address the North Stream-2, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany in the vicinity of Ukraine.
According to Moravecko, Russia could use the pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland ' s efforts to stop the flow of migrants seeking entry from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels solve the crisis.
Poland ' s judicial system, however, remains a cause for disagreement.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, stating that the judicial reforms carried out by the Justice and Justice Party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its Supreme Court ruled that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
The new Government of Germany, which has sworn on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to stop the work of the North Stream-2 in the event of an invasion of Russia into Ukraine.
The American officials told Congress members that they had reached a understanding with Germany of the ceasefire if Russia entered Ukraine, reported on Tuesday by a senior U.S. Congress official.
The German officials did not confirm these messages, but Scholz warned on Wednesday about the consequences of Russia's breach of Ukraine's border and confirmed this position on Sunday by the representatives of the Great Seven.
Dmitry, take a closer look.

Let's make sure they're okay.
It's always surprising when they write about the means to wash up the crab, the uniforms, the amphibians, the cranes.

Mincs want to give writers residence
The future Russian Literacy Support Fund will be transferred by the State to the federal property that remains to be inherited by the USSR Writers Union and the USSR Literacy Fund.

The money in the church wall will pay $20,000
The Santechnik who found the money in the church wall in Texas, U.S.A., will pay the reward.
This is reported in the press release of the non-commercial Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in the great evangelical church of Lakewood, where pastor Joel Austin preaches that devout Christians are awaiting wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, Senator Justin Kouli repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of packages of money and waiting.
He gave up the church and, as he said, did not even receive thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you've done and what you could have done" - quoted him as saying, "KRC-TV.
It seems that finding is related to the theft that took place in Lakewood seven years ago.
At that time, about $20,000 was lost in cash and $40,000 in the form of cheques stored in a church safe.
Money was insured, so the church did not suffer loss.
However, information on criminals was announced at $25,000.
Justin Couli could not claim that amount because the award was over.
In spite of this, the non-commercial Crime Stoppers of Houston, in its time, awarded $50,000 and later awarded another $20,000 in a gift from the Lakewood Church, has decided to reward the honesty of the santechnics.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police had questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the church wall of Lakewood.

In Brazil, citizens were obliged to present a passport for vaccination when entering the country
In Brazil, they had been obliged to apply for a decision by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Robert Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brazil.
Since the issuance of a vaccination certificate, citizens who are opposed to vaccination have been released.
The list of exceptions also includes persons from countries where the absence of a vaccine has been demonstrated.
“The situation is even more serious if you realize that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, Pre-Carnival, Carnival, and other activities, which entails an increase in the turquoise”, said Barros.
In the past, the Brazilian authorities had imposed an obligation on tourists to comply with a five-day quarantine.
A comprehensive protection scheme from COVID-19
A virusologist, a doctor of medical science, who earned Russian scientist Anatolie Altstein in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme of full protection against coronary infection.
He said that this could be achieved by injecting and using the nasal vaccine.
For international use, there is a large amount of immunoglobulin A. This is not the case with the introduction of the vaccine.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And within the course of vaccination, we have most of the immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you introduce both vaccines, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G, but there's still no solution for a double vaccination," the doctor said.
The main prophylacticist of Urfo, Dr. Sergei Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination with injection was the possibility of stopping being a COVID-19 carrier.
He added that this would help to ensure that in such a case, the protection of the body was likely to become the maximum.
Former Minister of Health of the Netherlands David Melik-Guesinov said that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to the spread of a new coronary infection among children.
He said that such a picture was seen in other countries where the regular wave of pandemic had come earlier.
Other, um...
I talked to a woman (death a long time ago) like this: if you're ready to change the warm home, the pet, love, love and games on the liquid bitch, go ahead.
But the pessal was trained and quite smart.
He chose my society and went home.
In a video that works in 90% of cases.
Not taken for granted, believe me.
I've been holding many of my bosses so they wouldn't run after the dog, even though they said that they were running away, 200 thousand vans (pomsky), took their hand and led the other way.
In the end, "200 thousand" was chosen by the owner, not by the dog that ran somewhere.
Mass protests against vaccination continue in Europe
In Vienna, Austria, more than forty thousand demonstrators went out on the street.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make the vaccination of copper compulsory.
From February next year, innocent people will have to pay a fine of €3,600.
The Spaniards who were upset by the health policies of the authorities conducted a peace march in Madrid.
Some were holding a poster with the inscription "This is a fake pandemic," "I won't be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the certificate is mandatory for accessing bars, restaurants, sports halls, old-fashioned houses and night entertainment facilities.
The decision to introduce health passports has been taken by a number of regions of the country to increase the number of cases of coronal virus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then it grew into clashes with the guards.
The group of demonstrators started throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers applied watertights.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia, there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she started studying earlier.

WHO has detected “micron” in six decades
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new strain of the crown virus “micron” has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain may have disastrous consequences.
The rate of strain proliferation was reported in the WHO communication.
As of 9 December, the stock has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is because it has been actively spreading since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of circulation of the new version of the crown virus.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain on the preliminary data can be passed to the extent of the spread of the delta strains, the same Indian version of the crown virus, which is now operating in all countries completely without exception.
Previously, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhan Gebreyezus, stated that micro-organisms could have a significant impact on the course of the coronary pandemic.
The same conclusions have also been drawn in Britain.
The experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that “micron” will crush “delta” in the coming months.
And the number of patients in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is because the official “micron” is currently suffering from several hundred people in the Kingdom and estimated to be up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the micron strain, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to the hospital on a daily basis.
The British health system will not be able to cope with this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the efficacy of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain “micron” 32 times below compared to the rest of the disease.
As the Russian satellite V is still unknown, it will be understood in the next few weeks.
The Hamalai Center has only started testing the Russian vaccine at the strain “micron”.

Russians warned of a new scheme of fraud
Illustrators started looking for new ways to cheat on video messages.
This is what the Reports say with reference to experts.
According to Ividion Zaura Abutalimov's product director, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communications is defhecies.
In this case, fake videos are produced by fraud on the basis of real records involving the victim.
This neurosect makes it possible to accurately reproduce the characteristics of a person.
Abutalim added that by using dipfaces, abusers could call a known video victim or create a role with a human copy for blackmail.
"Such counterfeits can simply trigger bulling, because a undercovered villain can put people in uncomfortable, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-scene scenarios," said the expert.
In turn, leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Wetcol noted that psychological people are more confident when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of video technology.

She says that it is especially common for workers who experience major pain, breakdown, and weakness.

Our lives have changed radically.
"We've been sleeping for a long time, we've been on the couch all day, we're probably eating more, and we're eating less, the doctor has argued.
For the sake of food and for lack of water, it is a burden and a burden.
The additional role is to be played by the late rise.

Researchers in the UAR reported low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against “micron”
In the UAR, Pfizer vaccine against “micron” was reported to be low-efficiency.
Researchers in the South African Republic have conducted a study and reported a low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against coronal strain.
It is estimated that it (the level of micron neutralization) corresponds to (the level of) the effectiveness of the vaccine in 22.5 per cent of the infection with symptoms, and therefore... is subject to doubt about the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, as stated in the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
In doing so, experts have clarified that the medicine can save from a serious flow of disease.
In the early days of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the micro-organisms of the crown virus could cause a new wave of pandemics in Britain with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How many hidden sugars in ordinary products?
Sugar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
Its survival may lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Users should take into account that under the unknown word the product may contain hidden sugar, a similar sugar by calorie, composition and glycaemic index.
A number of dozens of names may be present on the label, in fact, indicating sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
Other raw sugars, such as dextrose (sugar obtained from maize), leucose (fruit sugar), melasa (black duck), agawa syrup, etc., may also be found.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery but also in ketchup, in a doctoral flask, bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce the consumption of sugar, as stated in the Russian Federation, is to use products that are targeted and unprocessed, as well as to pay attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever is called the ingredient of the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact quantity of sugar, as not only the quantity of sugar indicated by the producer in the package must be taken into account, but also that the fruit, fruit, etc. originally contains a certain quantity of sugar.
Thus, the total quantity of sugar may be significantly higher than that indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholtz: Gas loses importance for FRG 25 years later
The new FRG Chancellor Olaf Scholtz said that gas imports were losing importance for Germany, as the country continued to move towards decarbonization.
He said that by 2045 Germany was planning to completely abandon gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is 25 years from now, the world will be in such a way that the issue of gas transport to the FRG and Europe will play a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholtz noted that Germany continued to maintain its commitment to Ukraine ' s transport of Russian natural gas and in the future, as this resource was now important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement in which Berlin ' s support for Ukraine ' s energy transformation was recorded.
Former Head of MID Germany, Annalna Berbok, stated that the process of certification of the "North Stream - 2 " pipeline continued.
According to the Minister, in the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition treaty, it was stated that energy projects should apply European energy law.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline is not in conformity with the requirements of the European Union.

Hackers broke Twitter Prime Minister of India
The hackers broke the Twitter account of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.
Illustrators managed to publish a faecal message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized the beating as a legitimate means of payment, as well as that the country had already purchased the cryptovalut.
At Modi's office, they asked to ignore new messages.
The Prime Minister said that Twitter had responded quickly - access to the account has been restored.
The Indian Prime Minister's site had already been broken up in 2020 and had been called upon to make contributions to the fund through cryptography.
At the New Caledonia referendum, most voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Thursday, 12 December, the majority of New Caledonians voted during the referendum against their territory.
The level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by the local authorities, "for " the independence of New Caledonia from France" was 3.51% (2755) of those who voted, while 96.49% (75 762) voted "against".
Yawka was 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians participating in the elections.
As France-Presse commented on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections did not leave room for doubt”, as independence supporters urged voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed it on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevented the holding of a full and " fair" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation opened the way for the third victory of French New Caledonia supporters, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, 53.3 per cent in 2020.
As separatists have said, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and dispute them at the UN.
As stated on Thursday, 12 December, in the Elisei Palace, the President of France Emmanuel Macron should address the outcome of the referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia ' s independence has revived much in the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates expressed the benefit of keeping the territory in France, since it is “the last region of the European Union’s presence in the Pacific”.
"New Caledonia must remain French," said Eric Zemmur repeatedly.
The same statement was made by a candidate from the Republicans of Valerie Pekress, who, at the end of October, published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position “because it is not his responsibility”.
However, the President added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “a strong desire for the selection of the Caledonians to be the choice of France”.

WSJ readers criticized the article on relations between Russia and the United States
The readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell's article, in which he described his vision of Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West was allegedly bringing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger that comes from Moscow and allowed a number of insults to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of Hartwell, Western countries were urged to “opportunity against Russia”.
The WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"In this article, quite a lot of false information," says the RIA News of a reader.
"Europe is not ours to lose it," and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and NATO allies will never enter the nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," another said.

Magnitude earthquake 5.2 occurred in the Curyl Islands area
The 5.2 magnitude earthquake occurred near Shikotan Island.
It is noted that the earthquake was 231.8 km north-east of North Kurilsk.
Ochag lay at a depth of 92.5 kilometers.
Previously, seismologists recorded a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in Peru, which affected ten people.

Ukraine will start producing reactive pilots of a new generation
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, an ANKA type of reactive non-pilot aircraft (BPLA) will be created.
On 11 December, the Foreign Counsellor of the Head of Office of Ukrainian President Alexei Arestovic reported this.
That is, they're capable of acting against air objects, against other unmanned pilots.
Even against the flight of a pilot.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the other Turkish aircraft: corpus and so on," says his Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA devices, Arestovic said that they were reactive rather than malicious BPLAs.
According to him, this is a new generation of homeless after Bayraktar who exceed it "by all characteristics".
The first BPLA batch should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovic concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the pilotless was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The Ukrainian headquarters had previously classified data on the use of Bayraktar pilots and Javelin missile facilities during military operations in Donbass.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, reported that the country had begun the construction of a factory for the manufacture of modern military pilots.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and Ukrainian mini-defence concluded an agreement on construction in the Kiev area of the centre, where staff training and testing and maintenance of Turkish BPLA Bayraktar will take place.
The Office of the Ukrainian Leader's Press Service referred to this memorandum as “a major real step forward”.
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport.
The lions escaped at Singapore’s Changi airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two thieves were able to get out of the Lviv family container that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were sent.
One of the running lions went down to the top of the container.
The animals could not have escaped from it because of a number of protective nets.
The opposition ended after the arrival at the airport of Mandai Wildlife Group, which knows all Singapore Zoos.
They have removed lions by means of trunks and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion fled from the owner and wandered through the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and the humans did not.
Specialists warned about the threat of cancer from vitamin B9
Studies show that vitamin B9 excess also known as folic acid may lead to cancer.
Daily Express warned of this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not have a lack of folic acid are less likely to suffer from some types of cancer, particularly colorectal.
However, overdosing the required dose in contrast contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of Alabama University in Birmingham, Dietologist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer is increased only if it is significantly shifted from this figure to the greater or lesser.
Kitin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without the advice of a doctor, to monitor the dose and to avoid milk and other foods containing folic acid.
Earlier, a nutrition consultant, Rachel Fine, called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, in avocados, Fine recommended that men have this fruit more often after 50 years.
In the United Kingdom by April, about 75,000 people could die from micron stoma.
British scientists predict that because of the spread of the micro-organism of the crown virus, up to 75,000 people can die in England in the next five months unless the winter limits are tightened.
The Guardian reported on this with reference to the study of experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the Scientific and Advisory Panel on Emergency Situations at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, at least 25 thousand aircraft will be recorded in the country due to the strain of micron and about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the hospital's peak, more than 2,000 people will be infected daily.
“Serious measures to combat the crown virus may be needed to prevent overload of the National Health Service if the micro-organisms become more contagious than the delta option and the existing vaccines cannot eliminate the infections,” said the mathematician Rosanna Bernard from LSHTM.
The United Kingdom Health Safety Agency had previously reported that if the rate of microbial proliferation remained at the current level, about 1 million cases of infection would be detected by the end of the year.
By mid-December, micron strains may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, in Britain, 1898 cases of coronal virus micromacrosis have been detected, 633 of which have been detected in the last few days.
On 9 December, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, pointed out that this figure could actually reach 10,000 cases.
She wanted to write some smart comment, but she read it before:
“The noise caused by the incredible suffering of the animal and its employment for the second job”.

The question of superheroes has grown worldwide for the fourth time
The construction of superstructures this year and the next year's orders are beating all the world's records, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world court register, the number of yachts ordered was 1,200, for a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money to float for 50 million pounds and above will not be reduced, says the Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year 25 per cent of the courts were ordered more than in the previous year.
Brokers say there was no 20-year-old living in the market.
The first reason is that many who can afford to fly are afraid of land infections and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second cause is also related to the coronation virus.
If all these people had previously gone to the office and met with business partners personally, the absolute majority of them were now working far away and the negotiations were going on.
Broker Will Kristy told the newspaper that the vertebrates took orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, only if their yacht is ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that during the absence of space travel, yacht life or flights on their own aircraft are a source of frustration in society, since the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with all other humanity.
Economists call upon Governments to take action and propose that new taxes and rules be introduced for super-rich people, although they understand that if money is such a move, it will be extremely difficult to implement it.
By the way, it only impresses the number of super-hate orders and their characteristics.
Of the 1200 vessels 27 are over 100 metres long.
The Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a Rev Ocean yacht 183 metres long.
After landing it will be the biggest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon swimming pool", as well as an underwater boat designed to study seabeds.
On existing super-ships, there have become common areas for helicopters, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, such as McGregor's jets, a single-track platform.The American University's economic anthropology professor at Indian University Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gases, carbon footprint produced by super-rich, is insignificant.
But it is symbolic if we realize that more than 2,000 millionaires in the world are heard.
This is just another example of the overuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emissions of billions in a thousand times more of the world ' s average population.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 per year, the largest pollutant on the planet is Roman Abramovic, responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases falling into the atmosphere in 2018.
Two thirds of the emission trails were concealed on its Eclipse yacht, 162.5 metres long.
Even if the owner is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and let the crew take the boat, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
The superheroes do not express the sympathy of others when they, as the richest woman in Australia, Gina Reinhardt, who owns a mine on the continent, complains about Jutub that there is no place for their giant courts to start.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build a 50-metre line for ships.
Hazardous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of bladder cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
That's what Daily Express writes.
Experts have concluded that the use of four and more portions of alcohol per week is linked to an increased risk of oncology.
This increases the likelihood of disease development by increasing the amount of alcohol used.
In addition, moderately drinking men are at risk of developing bladder cancer higher than women.
The exact reason for developing such an oncology cannot be determined by scientists, but only by noting that certain factors are harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old
Many, and more precisely, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But they don't even know how many quadruples really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to be sure to learn how to develop animal intelligence.
Although the vocabulary of the dog is not as extensive as human, the new study proves that the dog can respond to 89 words or phrases in a consistent manner.
The work of scientists was published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or make texts, they don't make sense of politics, economics and art, but they often manage to drain their masters.
Some people believe that experts show the best results in understanding the words of human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are still insufficient.
Yes, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses, such as labadors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are able to think logically and that they do not leave a two-year-old child if they are able to learn.

Prepared for trade in the United States and Russia in Ukraine
The United States and Russia will “trade” on Ukraine’s entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for Glarovi.
In his view, Washington and Moscow are soon planning to continue negotiations on the United States guarantees that Ukraine will not enter the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Baiden on the right of countries to “enter anywhere”.
If you are offered something that is knowingly unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not be trading, but just send the offerer.
And for Ukraine, there is a trade," wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia did not intend to attack Ukraine but sought dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparation takes place in secret, quickly and immediately, and does not wait until the opposition forces are detected and deployed,” he said.
China encourages the development of rail transport
Chinese technology has attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Transport and Equipment Exhibition in the city of Jujuju Province of Hunan / Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. have enabled trains to detect and diagnose technical deficiencies automatically, noted the representative of Hou Zhaoven.
High-speed trains on the China Laos railway line, which had been put into service at the beginning of this month, were already equipped with these technologies to ensure improved reliability and mobility.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased the exports of rail vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe have become witnesses to the “Chinese speed”.
In May of this year, the first two-way high-speed trains designed for export to Europe were developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
At the maximum working speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the pilot operation of the subway train, developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey, began.
The train will be driven by a metropolis connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The metro line will be open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at 120 kilometres per hour.
“The Chinese railway equipment industry is one of the highest levels of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness”, said Fen Yaosen, Head of the Chinese Trade and Investment Department of the Committee for the Promotion of International Trade Development (CCRMT).
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of China's high-class equipment production in the world market," said Fen Yaosan.
After more than 60 years of hard work, with a number of independent research and development, China has established a better system of rail equipment production, with a complete support kit and large-scale production activities.
According to Fen Yaosen, the country is taking the lead in the electrification of railways and in the operation of high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed early signs of dementia
The candidate for biological sciences, Semen Golosheikin, in conversation with Radio Sputnik, listed early signs of dementia.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be oblivion, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as inability to concentrate, to plan, to reduce abstract thinking.
A discussion is under way that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer ' s disease and one of its risks, said the expert.
The speaker stressed that the causes of dementia could be neurodegenerative disorders, head injury, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and the atherosclerosis of the main brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that doctors today do not know how to treat dementia effectively.
It is therefore necessary to start its prevention in time.
He said that reducing the risk of developing dementia would help to study foreign languages and active communication.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical load, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense memory involvement and thinking logic
“There are recommendations for the use of various Bads, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community,” Golosheikin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical load, regular training of cognitive skills and skills through games and hobbies that require intense memory involvement and thinking logic,” said Golosheikin.
Earlier, a charitable organization for the study of dementia in Britain stated that the disease was increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
The doctors called early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first alarming sign can be seen as a problem with vision, which makes it difficult for a patient to identify objects.
Another sign of developing weakness has been called an aphasia, a state where people cannot find the right words to convey what they want to say.
The neurologist needed to send Saakashvili to treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili needs psychonertic treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said journalist Otar Toidze, who is in the council of a doctor established by the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading cause of his disease.
Stable problems are the problems of movement, coordination, variability of character," said the expert, noting that this is not outside the normative framework and now the ex-president needs special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia," Toid said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special facility that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotage medical assistance after the prison staff had been subjected to his disciplinary punishment.
Georgian policy has been able to remove the punishment quickly and restore itself to the former rights.

Protests against COVID passports have taken place in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against a mandatory certificate of vaccination from COVID-19 have been carried out by the Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of shareholders was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID passports became mandatory for entry into bars, restaurants, sports halls, old-fashioned and night-time entertainment facilities.
Many protestors have come to action without masks.
They accused the State of totalitarianism with their complaints and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter recreational establishments and restaurants with more than 50 people in capacity.
Protesters in the city reported medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
More than 5.2 million cases of coronary infection have been reported in Spain since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, restrictions are also planned for unvaccinated.
The QR Codes Single Act was introduced by the Government in Gosdom on 12 November.
Russians are expected to be able to visit places of mass activities, cultural institutions, public food facilities and retail trade with either a birth certificate or a passed disease or a medota from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel on trains and aircraft.

The Great Rise — How the Chinese Become the Gornologics
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help establish an international court in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports activities, which will enable President C. Zinpin to collect 1 trillion yuan, but also facilitate the economic development of remote provinces.
The Taiwanese resort in Zhangzako, located close to the winter Olympics, is becoming more popular with Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greening work is also being carried out: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 mountain resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competition.
In many regions of China, where there are resorts, including in Zhangzako, there are snow problems.
The main goal of the long-term is to provide comfortable and interesting recreation in Chinese courts so that all new ones can become permanent.
However, it is still far from that.
Gambling Counsellor Justin Downs said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese lying industry has changed to ignorance.
Every year, more Chinese are being sent to the tendons.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many more years to create a mining culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to develop and create the infrastructure needed for rest.
The 70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Khulli, near the winter Olympics.
He noted that there had been a boom in winter sports tourism in recent years.
Two years ago, a high - speed railway from Beijing was launched, and no local population is suffering from unemployment.
The country is opening up more and more shops that trade clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slope, the points of general interview with the priests of the national kitchen are opened.
There's even a COVID-19 test station in Taiwan.
China is seeking to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders of major international competitions, and the resorts and equipment must reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world can face extreme poverty because of the pandemic, said WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be put into extreme poverty because of the crown virus pandemic, which has slowed mankind’s progress in universal access to health services, declared in the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
Two complementary reports were published on the International Day of the Universal Scope of Health Services of WHO and WB on the 12 December.
They found that the pandemic had caused measles and caused excessive stress in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population was reduced by immunization, increased mortality from tuberculosis and malaria.
In WHO and WB, it was stressed that the pandemic has caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so people have become more difficult to pay for treatment”.
This situation affects more than 500 million people “in extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services from their pockets.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrish said that the crown virus pandemic had put more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people had virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese Minister off broadcasting to the "Samites for Democracy" at the request of the White House
The speech of Taiwan ' s digital technology minister, Audrey Tan, during a panel discussion in the United States, "Samita for Democracy" was translated into a video-free mode, shows the record of the summit on YouTube.
The Reuters Agency with reference to sources claims that the picture was off at the request of the White House.
According to them, Taiwan had been awarded a separate colour from the PRC, which considered the island its territory.
The map displayed by Ms. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world to the extent of civil rights.
Taiwan was awarded green as "free", and the PRC, the PRC, Laos and Vietnam were red as "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, the picture was replaced by a box with a note that the views of the participants in the discussion “does not necessarily express the position of the United States Government”.
The PRC was not invited to the Sammit for Democracy.
The sources of Reuters note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese Minister could have gone contrary to the "One China" policy held by Washington.
One of the agency ' s sources stated that after the demonstration of the map, the U.S. National Security Council was angry with the Department of Justice, accusing him of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The “Samith for Democracy” organized by Washington went from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption was given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary Sobez F.F. Yuri Averyjanov said that the summit was “an anti-Russian and anti-Catian charge”.

A joint mechanism for the prevention and control of the State Council of the PRC has been issued by a circular to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where landfills are located in order to further prevent the spread of foreign infection.
According to the circular, those leaving cities should provide a negative result of the COVID-19 nucleic acid test received within 48 hours prior to departure.
Those who arrive in cities where land-use points are located should submit at least one test for COVID-19 nucleic acids upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will take effect from the date on which the relevant provincial administrative units will determine and publish the areas of these cities until 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities where land-use points are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of establishing buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

In the mid-term, there was a "fragile conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
The headlines of the Russian MIDI, Sergey Riabkov, in the "Reports" interview, assessed the prospects for Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, and there is some prospect of better relations that are completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion as a result of the long journey that we've been going through with both the current administration and the Trump and Obama.
The problem didn't start yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Rabkova, the problem is with the US ' s desire to impose Russia ' s approaches on a number of issues.
The MDGs added that it would not risk giving optimistic forecasts of better relations and would not expect to change Washington ' s position.
He explained that no progress was made except in areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity.
Russia therefore calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and that the Americans will listen to the arguments of a healthy sense.
Former Head of the Russian MIDI, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary-General Anthony Blancen, stated that Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
The virologist warned about the risk of vaccination with a medicinal product from COVID outside the hospital
In the case of Nasal Vaccines from COVID-19, allergy may occur and medical assistance may be required, so the first items to be administered should not be organized at airports and shopping centres.
This was reported by the TASS virusologist, member of the Correspondent RAN, the bioananotechnologies, microbiology and virusology of the University of Novosibir State, Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize national vaccinations at airports and shopping centres, but I would do so at first sight only in medical institutions.
The fact that there is a likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small but desirable for a person to sit next to the doctor's office.
The doctor has a special set of antiallergic drugs that work literally within a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
In the view of the virologist, it is possible to think about vaccination in shopping malls when experience has been gained in the use of the product.
He also stressed that when using the nasal vaccine, it was important for her to get on a mucous membrane in her nose.
However, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the ingested nose is removed after injection.

Sand has warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
President Dmitry Peskov ' s Press Secretary commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive” action against Ukraine, including due to alleged “invasion” on the territory of the country.
"Some restrictions on the introduction of Russia and the absence of suffering are impossible," said the official representative of Kremlin in the Russian television station.
Sand says it's "understanding everything in the world."
It was previously reported that the United States considered the possibility of imposing an anti-rossian sanctions on energy as the ultimate measure.
In addition, Washington and the Euro Union are planning to impose restrictions that would make the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund more difficult.
At the same time, the head of Sberbanka German Graff is certain that this is impossible.

New Caledonian residents rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of the participants refused to leave France.
On 12 December, the French television channel BFM.TV reported.
Against independence, 96.5% of the voters voted.
France had maintained its independence of 3.51% of the inhabitants of the Pacific archipelago.
The results were cancelled by 2.99 per cent of the bulletins.
The level of voting on that day was very low: about 55 per cent of the population of the archipelago had arrived in the area.
In the opinion of the experts, the low incidence is due to the separatists ' call for refusal to participate in the referendum because of the crown virus.
Paris refused to transfer the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the New Caledonian people in the referendum opposed the independence of France.
A referendum on independence has already been held in the region in 2018.
Most of the residents supported the finding of an archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
Some 270 thousand people live in the archipelago, and the territory is given special administrative and territorial status.
There is an agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration in 1998, whereby the region can vote on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

WHO provisionally considers “micron” less dangerous than “delt”
The World Health Organization (WHO) provisionally considers that “micron” is less dangerous than crown strain deltas.
However, there is evidence of a reduction in vaccine effectiveness in the new version of COVID-19.
For information on 9 December, “micron” has been registered in 63 countries.
“Preliminary data and a significantly modified antigen profile of the strain “micron” have resulted in a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transfer of the option.
According to preliminary findings from the UAR, it (the “weight of the disease” is expected to be less difficult than with the “delt””, says the WHO Technical Communication.
The Organization notes that all recorded cases of micronomous infection in the EU have been easily or unsymptomatic.
However, the new strain, according to the preliminary data, is spread more quickly to the deltas.
In Russia, two cases of microbacterial infection have been reported.
They “were previously immunized”, the Hamalai Center reported.
Anna Popova, Head of Plant Protection, stated that there is still no reliable evidence that the new version of the crown virus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios were identified for the Greens
The former Member of the Supreme Council, Vadim Denisenko, listed four developments for the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, in 2022.
In his view, the head of State could remain without the support of the West and possibly go to the Donbass compromises.
On Thursday, 12 December, Denisenko told us about this in a publication on the Glarovi portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called the “ideal storm”, implies that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev could face in 2023.
" There is also a parallel reduction in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and the opposition of the authorities with key GEFs (financial and industrial groups. - Order.) " , added the former parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the development of the situation - “war against all”.
This forecast will arise in the case of high turbulence in world policy, where Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
As a result of this situation, Ukraine ' s leadership may go to Donbass compromises, which may result in resistance within the country.
At the end of the summer, the position of the Greens will be weakened, the probability of such a situation, according to the former Nardep, will be up to 50 to 55 per cent.
The third option of developing the situation in Ukrainian politics is the opposition of the Green People ' s Group and the President, which is likely to lead to the control of the force bloc and the implementation of "popular Initiatives".
During such a crisis, Greensky will begin “reforming the government”, added Denisenko.
Another scenario is turning the Greens into "the father of the nation."
This could lead to an event that would be a great shock to society.
“The Union must be large enough to respond to external partners and increase Ukraine’s support,” Denisenko said.
This option is possible as a result of the natural disaster, the technological disaster or Russia ' s aggressive action, as ex-depute.
However, the Russian side has not once again rejected any "opportunity" on Ukraine.
In Moscow it was noted that Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States were increasing military activity at Russian borders.
Earlier on 11 November, data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the Ukrainian President ' s rating fell to record low values, with 19.3 per cent.
This has been the lowest since its election as head of State.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the near elections of the President of Ukraine for the Greens, only 21.8 per cent would vote, while for the former President of the country, Petr Poroshenko, 14.5 per cent would vote.
Of all the support requested, only 19.3 per cent were expressed to the President.

Arrested for action in the Red Square, the poet says, "For the quote of Eutushenko, 10 days give, this is the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
The VSE student was detained in the Red Square with a poster on which he wrote a hashtag #poetrossi and more.
This quote belongs to Evgen Eutushenko.
A protocol on the administrative article on the repeated violation of public action was established in Alexandria.
For the first time, he was arrested on 23 January in the Puškin Square, at a meeting in support of Alexie Avail.
"The aim was to draw attention to poetry in general, now to her interest, unfortunately lost, to the fall of a common culture in Russia and to inspire as little hope of unknown poets to write their texts online under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We have contacted a young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal his message in more detail.
How did police officers address you when you were detained this time?
What were they asking in the department, how did they comment on your action?
At this time, staff members were more accurate, and detention was as good as possible, as if it didn't sound funny in some context.
They took OMONovs on the Desert and they took them hard.
They asked the standard, about the motives.
When they heard, they would, in principle, see if they didn't approve, that's understandable.
Except for the four sides of the ringer, everything was absolutely correct, but I knew what he was on.
And if after the action under this hat they start writing their verses, even if a few people, I don't see these 10 days.
Maximum, according to the protocol, speak at least in the Tumba-Umba tribe.
Public and official events speak the language of the environment so that everyone can understand what happened in Bundestag on 25 September 2001, or in the native language through the translator.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks beautifully in Russian, but she still uses the help of the translator.
And there is still an old-fashioned autograph on official events, and the stenographer is not obliged to know a number of languages.

Researchers have reported how potatoes help to combat age violations
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micro-elements that contribute to improved blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root fruit contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, fishfloin, folate and pantene acids.
All of these elements help to operate the system of the body.
Furthermore, potatoes help to combat age violations.
Thanks to its large cell content, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract and may also help to prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis when used regularly.
However, for the best benefit, the fruit is better to chew or boil rather than to burn on the oil.
The previous edition of The Daily Express warned that potatoes may be dangerous for diabetics as well as other products with a high glycaemic index.
These are products containing carbohydrates that spread rapidly to sugar, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic drinks, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the Commersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the reduction in its production in private sub-sectors and the increase in processing capacity.
In the market's view, the product deficit can only be replaced by imports at this time.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the edition of "Jandex"
Candidates for the flight
In 2015, lawmakers from the RAEC/Media cluster made up a list of 100 major pirate sites of the race and most of them ended up in existence, says the Director of the Internet Research Institute Karen Kazarian.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still survived thanks to the regular change of domain name, he adds.

Estonian scientists will look for life in Vienna
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, prepares three space missions to Venus for the search for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on the "Current Camera" on Sunday.
The goal of five years of missions is to assess the suitability for the life of the Venus clouds and then find life there.
For the project, the Tartu scientists have proposed tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in the Venus clouds.
So far it has been estimated that the Venus cloud, the nearest to the Earth, is too acidic to exist there, but possibly Venus was originally a planet of the Earth type.
During the third mission, a sample of Venus was to arrive.
Let us assume that if we find life there, it will become the main question, whether it is earthly or different.
If so, it would be obvious that earthly life did not begin on earth.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," said the Estonian head of the Venus Life Finder project Michael Pausal.

Targets Change Russian Business
The theme of the metallurgy was a popular autumn this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced the conversion of Facebook to Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the biggest game confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
In other words, business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in the creation of its own goals and subsequent monnetization.
Targets should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards remote interactions in the pandemic has been halted by people from communication and restrictions.
In other words, this is the result of the business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models under them.
Third, they are a logical continuation of the trend in the digitization of assets, when any rights, securities, art and even money go into digital format.

British economists failed to predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict 2022 because he felt that such attempts would fail.
He wrote about this in the article for the Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be an unforeseeable trap and that any trend can change traffic.
The pandemic of the crown virus remains the most important factor, and secondly, inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also acknowledged that he did not know whether or not there was an increase in prices for goods.
As the expert pointed out, before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of the infinite generosity of central banks had already survived” and that it was time to return to relationships where inflation rates would be correlated with the expected growth of GDP.
O'Neill noted that, in the background of the pandemic, the continuation of an excessive economic policy could, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new outbreak of inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the question of productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, Michael Schulgin, head of the Global Research Open-up Division, reported that positive expectations for the $2022 dollar would be maintained, while growth potential would be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar, Sulgin referred to the monetary policy of the FRS, the price dynamics of oil and fear in the background of the crown virus pandemic.

Russians gave about 4.5 per cent of the country's GDP to auto dealers
As a result of the 10 months 2021, Russians spent 2 trolleys of 784 billion rubles on new cars, which is 28 per cent higher than the same period last year, show the statistics of the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the State on supporting citizens and economies during the crown virus pandemic.
President Vladimir Putin, President of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, said last September that this amount was more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s domestic gross product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia is led by Russian market revenues.
In 10 months this year, he was able to drive 325.7 billion rubles, almost 24 per cent more than a year earlier.
The Hyundai brand's Kia family has an even greater increase of over 35 per cent and the cost of selling cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In leading positions, this brand and the increase in the average price of the car - Hyundai has grown by almost 21 per cent per year, up to 1.94 million rubles - the stronger travel dynamics were only in Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
In doing so, the sales volume of Korean brands had not increased so much: according to the statistics of the Autoproducer Committee of the European Business Association in Russia, Kia had achieved more than 9.4% of its machinery in the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
It closes three cash sales leaders in Japan, Toyota, who spent 275.5 billion rubles on Russian cars in 10 months, which amounted to 14 per cent more than a year earlier.
The Japanese reported Mercedes-Benz with 266.1 billion rubles (+75 per cent) - the German brand's premium was increased and sales volume (37%) and the average weighted car price (almost 28 per cent, up to 8.2 million rubles).
"The Mercedes-Benz simultaneously saw good sales growth and a moderate price increase -- more, for example, than the BMW -- from here and greater growth in financial capacity -- explained the NAPI Director Tatyana Arabaji.
At the rate of the increase in sales, the fantastic indicators show Chinese brands, as well as a significant increase in financial capacity this year."
Russian Income Growth Lada shows mid-term indicators (plus 28 per cent), with Russian cars spending 229.4 billion rubles in 10 months.
Last year's financial year, companies that sold their cars in 2021 fell: in particular Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
In the past 10 months, the Russians spent 12 billion rubles on off-roads and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year ago.
In the light of the problems with the supply of automotive components and production failures that cover the world's road, cars continue to adjust prices continuously - the same "AutoWAZ" has increased the value of Lada's models seven times a year, the last trip (on 8-10 thousand rubles) took place at the end of November.
Prices for their products and other autoproducers are regularly overwritten.
The volume of Russia ' s car market in monetary terms will continue to increase, in addition to the lack of cars, inflation is contributing to this, as well as the desire of automobiles to lose their past losses, experts believe.
In the absence of cars, I think that many car concerts have even partially been able to pass on to the user the cost of the past periods that they could not put in the price of cars before,
He's an analyst on Vladimir Bespalov's highway.
I believe that car manufacturers are now feeling very well financially by supporting the high margin of sales."
The indirect indicator of this is the rate of increase in the value of cars observed during 2021, the prices for new cars are growing faster, the expert explains.
In the long term, markets will grow both in terms of quantity and in terms of money, but mainly through inflation and the complexity of the construction of cars themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With increased opportunities to increase prices, there will be limited opportunities.
In a monetary statement, the Russian author will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the cost of the car is slowed down, the car producers will be able to obtain their income from the volume, notes the independent car consultant Sergey Burgazliev.
In view of the increased demand and lack of supply, car manufacturers are now seeking the highest profit from each car sold, notes Burgasliev.
The increase in the production of machinery is not expected at least in the near half-years, while in Russia, there is still a growing lack of confidence among citizens in the future.
In the light of the market situation, cars have proved to be a safe investment facility - a purchased car a year ago, even with a drive, it is now possible to sell the original price, says the expert.
Byiden spoke of the transfer of the United States military to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending U.S. soldiers to Ukraine in the event of Russia ' s invasion.
The U.S. President Joe Byden made such a statement.
"There have never been such plans," said the head of the White House, replying to the journalist's question whether the United States had renounced such an idea.
Byiden noted that if the situation around Ukraine was escalating, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that there was no possibility of unilateral use of American troops to defend Ukraine on the agenda.
Byiden explained that if Russia enters the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer its forces to NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the east flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Byden said.
Former Russian President Dmitry Peskov's press secretary stressed that Moscow had no intention of entering the territory of Ukraine.
He pointed out that Moscow saw the problem of the military use of the drones by Kiev by Turkey, as well as that “the American weapon is approaching our territory”.
